(actually my kids go to bed earlier than most <br/>\n(8pm), and my 10yodd doesnt even mind!  she gets up early in the am and <br/>\nreads...)  plus, i like the control that i feel when everyone is in bed and i <br/>\ncan relax!  haha!  so we are regular (not scheduled necessarily, just aware <br/>\nof who needs what) about sleep and meals.  it seems to keep us healthy and <br/>\nhappy.  oh-- i also agree with someone else&#39;s point about having younger kids <br/>\n(some infant/toddler ages) affecting the household needs in this area!<br/>\n<br/>\nok, the old tv question, too.  as my kids get older they have more say just <br/>\nlike in everything else about what they would like to see.  so to me it is a <br/>\nsimilar issue as other things: when they are little, we the parents have to <br/>\nset the limits, then as they grow, they take over so that by the time they <br/>\nare teens they are making decisions.<br/>\nalso, i think i have a personal distaste for tv watching in general because <br/>\nfor me it is such a passive escape thing.  i think for others it is not <br/>\nneccesarily this way, just my makeup.  but i think it more likely that my <br/>\nkids are like me and so i err on the side of encouraging productive activity <br/>\nunless a veg-time need is evident... than we (or whoever needs it) all crash <br/>\nand veg, but we are choosing it on purpose.  rather than being controlling,  <br/>\ni just try to share with them what i have learned for myself about these <br/>\nthings....<br/>\nerin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7358,"nextTopicId":7360}}
