The system wants to control your<br/>\nlife for as long as possible. It gets its life blood (money) from having<br/>\nbodies in its buildings -- the more bodies, the more blood.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe system is called Outcome Based Education (OBE). It means that the school<br/>\nis interested in knowing that you have &quot;learned&quot; what it wants you to know.<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t matter how long it takes you to &quot;learn&quot; it, because you can keep<br/>\ntaking the tests until you &quot;pass.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other reason for the tests is that the government collects personal<br/>\ninformation about every student and the tests include several impertinent<br/>\nquestions, such as nationality, race, income, parent occupation, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour question is a good one: Since high school is designed so that children<br/>\nwill be sure to get an 8th grade schooling, why should the state keep<br/>\nchildren in school so long after they have acquired the 8th grade<br/>\ninformation. The answer is that it has jobs to fill, money to spend (ours)<br/>\nand people whom it wants to control. It&#39;s all a huge waste of time, money<br/>\nand children&#39;s lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer is to drop out and go to college when you&#39;re ready, or get a job<br/>\nin order to start your real life - now, why wait? - or unschool in order to<br/>\nlearn whatever interests you. Control your own life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no reason to stay in the school, unless you &quot;like&quot; it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41528,"nextTopicId":41526}}
