Often he is not finished with independent work when<br/>\nit is time to move on to the next activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy assessment:<br/>\nMy kid is a success in that room because of his intelligence and if he<br/>\nweren&#39;t naturally into it or bored he will talk to his friends and so what<br/>\nif he does stop and talk now and then don&#39;t we all do that as adults? Don&#39;t<br/>\nwe want them to learn how to be social? When I taught we encouraged dialogue<br/>\namoung the students. Why can&#39;t each child finish their activities in their<br/>\nown time? Obviously he is careful and slow because he wants to do a good job<br/>\nor maybe he fears doing a less than perfect one because of it why penalize<br/>\nhim by forcing him to hurry up and be a slob and a dummy just to keep up?<br/>\nShe wanted him to come to class 15 minutes earlier every day.

This teacher is NOT a boring teacher she is sort of<br/>\non &quot;speed&quot; IMHO  and that is similar to the many cut throat college students<br/>\nI met as an undergrad all in a hurry to end up with big bucks in their<br/>\npockets some day and later collapse and die of heart attacks from the pace<br/>\nof their lives.
