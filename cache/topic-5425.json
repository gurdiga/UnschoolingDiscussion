In fact we have a different<br/>\nbrand.  I just can&#39;t remember the name of it.  It&#39;s lasted better than the<br/>\nHalti.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the Halti goes around the muzzle so the dog feels the pull on the<br/>\nside of the mouth rather than the neck - kind of like a horse halter but not<br/>\n*in* the mouth.  Dogs don&#39;t really mind the pulling around their neck.  In<br/>\nfact they&#39;ll just keep pulling and choking and pulling and choking.  But<br/>\nthey *hate* the pressure on the side of the mouth.  So they don&#39;t pull.<br/>\nWith the Halti on, I can just move the leash to one side and he&#39;ll turn<br/>\ninstantly.  He doesn&#39;t pull at all after the first minute or so.  They cost<br/>\naround $20 Canadian, so maybe $14 US.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary<br/>\nsaftety deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;  Ben Franklin<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":108691200,"authorName":"Kimber","from":"&quot;Kimber&quot; &lt;snibbor@...&gt;","profile":"twoangels_jj","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] off topic","postDate":"1037890599","msgId":50370,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2QwMWMyOTE2ZSQzMzA2YTllMCQyZGJkZmVhOUBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PEYxMDFKWE94SmFnWFRpOE0xOVYwMDAwMDRkYkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":50346,"nextInTopic":63483,"prevInTime":50369,"nextInTime":50371,"topicId":5425,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1358974236\">&lt;&lt;&lt;My oldest daugher and myself are going to be guests on the Oprah Winfrey <br/>\nshow.
