We have not watched the movie The Hulk, have seen a bit of the cartoons, so I think we will look into that. Riley handles very powerful movies well, it seems. He loves the Lord of the Rings series. I like the idea of looking at this theme within the Harry Potter series and we have not read book 5 to him. Started it, stopped, lost it under the bed for a few months. Next after Eragon. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, thank you, I have a fresh approach to an idea Riley keeps bringing up. He told me the other day he wanted to open his brain and pinch out the mean part. <br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102354,"nextTopicId":102424}}
