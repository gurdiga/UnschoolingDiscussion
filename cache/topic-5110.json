If we are divided, we could potentially wind up<br/>\nwith worse regulations during this current climate of increasing testing<br/>\nand accountability.  Should the regulations be opened up?  Is this the<br/>\nright time? Is legislative relief the right avenue?  What is the history<br/>\nof New York homeschooling&#39;s regulations? There are many questions to<br/>\nanswer.<br/>\n<br/>\n    NYHEN is happy to offer this forum to New York homeschoolers and<br/>\nother interested parties.
