Ours shows the <br/>\ndate on each picture.  We also get doubles each time we develop the <br/>\npictures, so one set goes into a ring binder which has &quot;The Adventures <br/>\nof Katie Peterson&quot; boldly in place on the front.  This in itself was a <br/>\nlesson in computer usage, as she played around with many fonts before <br/>\nchoosing the one displayed.  In addition to pictures of &quot;real&quot; <br/>\nadventures (the zoo, vacations, a tour of the local TV weather set) <br/>\nthere are pictures of Kate making pancakes, holiday cards, finding <br/>\ncaterpillars, caring for her nieces and other day to day learning <br/>\nexperiences.  When someone starts on me at all about her education, I <br/>\nhand over the ring binder.  It may not convince them, but it&#39;s a great <br/>\ndistraction and it proves that we&#39;ve spent a lot more time together <br/>\nthan parents who send their kids to school do.                        <br/>\n                                                                      <br/>\n    Hope this helps,    Terese</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112654892,"authorName":"mollygivens","from":"&quot;mollygivens&quot; &lt;mollygivens@...&gt;","profile":"mollygivens","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Keeping records, etc.","postDate":"1021385534","msgId":37042,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFicjV2dStxY3JtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37044,"prevInTime":37041,"nextInTime":37043,"topicId":37042,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was just wondering if there is a good unschooling way of keeping records of kids activities that would be considered educational ?

But some of my friends and family<br/>\n(three are teachers)think we just play all the time, and that <br/>\nthey &#39;CAN&#39;T be really LEARNING anything.  It seems everyone wants to <br/>\nsee something &#39;official looking&#39; I guess....like a report card, a <br/>\nprogress report, a schedule, etc.  In other words &#39;school&#39; at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve done pretty well at avoiding their questions, because so far, <br/>\ntheir questions have all been of a negative nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand their concerns, because I would have been right there <br/>\nalong with them at one time, questioning someone who I thought was <br/>\nneglecting their child&#39;s education.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my problem in satisfying their questions is that I can become <br/>\nVERY adamant in DEFENDING my choices, and can&#39;t be &#39;reasonable&#39; <br/>\nenough to come across as having any brains at all:)  So I end up just <br/>\navoiding their questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s anybody&#39;s business, really, but I do want to keep <br/>\nmy friends:)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nMolly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37092,"nextTopicId":37100}}
