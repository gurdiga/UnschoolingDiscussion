This is the second time you have replied to a <br/>\nposter on this list by stating that one of your posts wasn&#39;t addressed to <br/>\nthem. When you post on the list your post is assumed to be addressing <br/>\nEVERYONE on the list. And if you include someone&#39;s name (like you did <br/>\nSandra&#39;s) in a post then it is doubly assumed that not only is the post for <br/>\neveryone, it is for the person mentioned as well. Regardless, if you post, <br/>\nanyone, including Leoine, is allowed to reply. If you want your post to be <br/>\nonly &quot;for&quot; certain people, or you only want certain people to reply to you <br/>\ndon&#39;t send it to the list, send it privately. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41983,"nextTopicId":42010}}
