I made <br/>\ncertain that when she shared with her friends that she be careful <br/>\nnot to say, &quot;We don&#39;t have to do school any more.&quot; However, no <br/>\nmatter how it gets explained, I&#39;m finding out that kids hear &quot;They <br/>\ndon&#39;t do school any more.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo while eating dinner, the mother asked my dd what history she <br/>\nwas studying. The friend piped up: &quot;She doesn&#39;t have to do <br/>\nhistory. She doesn&#39;t even have to do any school!&quot; Needless to <br/>\nsay, this sparked quite an interrogation. Ironically my dd and I <br/>\nhad sat together that morning with the Teenage Liberation <br/>\nHandbook laying out some ideas for her to pursue. She likes <br/>\nhaving goals and a plan. So we took her interests and I helped <br/>\nher brainstorm a variety of ways to study, write and enjoy her <br/>\ninterests (which just happen to include tree frogs, classic <br/>\nliterature, theater arts, French, Norse mythology and AIDs).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was able to share some of these with concrete ideas she <br/>\nhas for investigating them, but she did feel like there were lots of <br/>\nknowing glances being exchanged between parents. Funny <br/>\nthing is, I spoke on unschooling to this group last year. They all <br/>\nthink I&#39;m an unschooler. (According to the books and lists I was <br/>\non before, I thought so too. According to the definitions here, I <br/>\nwas an eclectic or relaxed homeschooler). But the idea that you <br/>\nwould not require any minimum requirements! Well this was too <br/>\nmuch for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd&#39;s best answer did get their attention. She said, &quot;You know, <br/>\nbefore when my mom was requiring me to do Algebra, I would try <br/>\nto put it off and hope to be invited to a friend&#39;s house so I could <br/>\nskip it that day. Now that it&#39;s up to me, I want to make sure that I <br/>\nget it done. Whether I go to college or not is dependent on me, <br/>\nnot my mom.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis impressed them, but the skepticism didn&#39;t go away that <br/>\neasily. They all decided that my daughter is an exceptionally <br/>\nmotivated, unique &quot;good&quot; girl. (This is what I&#39;ve always <br/>\nheard--&quot;Your kids are really neat. My kids aren&#39;t like yours. They <br/>\ndon&#39;t have interests. They would veg out all day in front of the TV <br/>\nso I have to require things of them...&quot;) We&#39;ve always appeared to <br/>\nbe very unstructured compared to everyone we know. And my <br/>\nkids have always had a lot of diverse interests that they pursue <br/>\non their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think kids ought to have to &quot;defend&quot; their way of <br/>\nschooling?

I realize my kids <br/>\nare not of school-age yet (although many kids to go pre-school at their age) <br/>\nand there really is no need to do this at their ages, 3 and 4 years old, but <br/>\nI think it helps my family understand how everyday things are or can lead to <br/>\na big learning activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my parents once asked my daughter what she did today, she said &quot;I played <br/>\nBarbies&quot;.  My parents then asked me how she&#39;s coming with writing her name.  <br/>\nThey asked me is she started practicing.  I didn&#39;t answer them, but began <br/>\ntalking about her playing with Barbies.  While playing with her Barbies, she <br/>\nhad real money that she would use to buy things at the pretend store she <br/>\nmade.  She has done this for several days in a row and by playing she learned <br/>\nall of her coins and how much each are worth.  She even began adding coins <br/>\ntogether, with my help, to figure out how much she needed to buy something.  <br/>\nIt seemed to make them more relaxed about the idea of letting kids learn on <br/>\ntheir own, or at least for that moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother day my parents were talking to me about how my daughter was doing <br/>\nwith her writing (this seems to be such a big deal for them), and I said <br/>\nfine.  I began telling them how my son and daughter make their own breakfast <br/>\nin the morning (with a little help), make their own hot chocolate milk, put <br/>\naway their dishes in the sink, help me cook, and help me clean around the <br/>\nhouse.  I told them that this is very important because it gives them a sense <br/>\nof accomplishment, it gives them confidence in their abilities, and they are <br/>\nskills that are important as they get older.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYet, another day my parents asked me the same question about my daughter <br/>\nwriting her name.  I told them she enjoys writing her name and is doing fine. <br/>\n They asked her what she was doing today and she said playing with Lincoln <br/>\nLogs.  She told them about the buildings she and her brother made, how the <br/>\nbig tornado knocked it down, and then gave them a detailed description of <br/>\nwhat a tornado was and how important it is to go in the basement if we&#39;re <br/>\nunder a warning.  I explained to them that her discovery of tornadoes has led <br/>\nto her desire to learn about other natural things, like volcanoes and <br/>\nlightning.  They seemed to be very happy about her learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother day, my daughter signed her name to a card that was for my parents.  <br/>\nThey were very happy to see that she could write her name.  I explained to <br/>\nthem that she learned to write her name by having a strong desire to do so.  <br/>\nShe wanted to write her name on pictures that she drew and on the dry eraser <br/>\nboard.  I didn&#39;t have to sit her down every day or on a regular basis to make <br/>\nher write her name.  This really helped them begin to understand my approach <br/>\nto having my children learn what they want, when they want, how they want, <br/>\nand where they want.

It&#39;s <br/>\nsomething that is weird to most people.  The reason for this is because they <br/>\ndon&#39;t really know anything about it.  They draw conclusions about what <br/>\nchildren must be like who are homeschooled.  Because most parents went to <br/>\nschool, they cannot begin to understand why anyone would want to homeschool, <br/>\nespecially unschool, their chidlren.  They also may take it very personally.  <br/>\nThey may think, &quot;I went to school, and you went to school, so what&#39;s wrong <br/>\nwith that?  Does this mean you think I made a mistake by sending you to <br/>\nschool?  You feel I made a bad choice?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first told my parents about the decision to homeschool, I didn&#39;t <br/>\nrealize at first that they were defensive because my choice, in their minds, <br/>\nwas telling them that their choice wasn&#39;t right.  My main decision to <br/>\nhomeschool had more to do with how children learn best than the environment <br/>\nof bullying and teasing, drugs, etc.  After I realized that my decision to <br/>\nhomeschool made them feel like I was telling them they made a bad choice in <br/>\nsending me to school, I had a talk with them.  I explained to them that their <br/>\nchoice to send me to school wasn&#39;t a bad choice.  There were not many <br/>\nhomeschoolers back in the &#39;60&#39;s and early &#39;70&#39;s, so even if I knew about it <br/>\nand I had kids then, I most likely wouldn&#39;t have homeschooled them.  I <br/>\nexplained to them with the support groups and technology, and the laws in <br/>\nMichigan we have now that it&#39;s a much better time to homeschool, in regards <br/>\nto the resources and information available.  After talking to them, it was <br/>\namazing how quickly they began to support our decision to homeschool.  My <br/>\nmother and father are all for it and they even inform me when there&#39;s <br/>\nanything on TV about homeschooling.  Although they are for it, we have <br/>\ndifferent views about homeschooling.  I told them upfront that I will not be <br/>\ngiving my kids tests, using textbooks (unless kids want to), have a schedule, <br/>\nno spelling tests, no lesson plans (not that we won&#39;t plan things), etc.  I <br/>\nknow this is hard for them to understand but I explained it to them that <br/>\nchildren don&#39;t have to have specific times to learn, sit at a table and work <br/>\non worksheets and tests, and learn the way children at school learn.  I told <br/>\nthem if I&#39;m going to do that, I misewell just send them to school.  I told <br/>\nthem I feel strongly that my kids will learn best by making choices on what <br/>\nthey want to do for the day.  This doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t be there to encourage <br/>\nthem, give them suggestions, find materials I think they&#39;ll love, and answer <br/>\nquestions.  My father is beginning to understand, but he still has doubts and <br/>\nconcerns.  I think this is normal because so do I.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever too late to open up the communications channel.  I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t think my parents would come around so quickly, but they did.  If you <br/>\ntalk to them and explain all the reasons why you want to homeschool <br/>\n(unschool), give them some material to read on homeschooling or unschooling, <br/>\ngive them some material to read on the failure and negative aspects of <br/>\nschools, let them know that you are not upset with them for sending you to <br/>\nschool (unless you have anger and resentment for this), let them read success <br/>\nstories of people who were homeschooled (the book Homeschoolers&#39; Success <br/>\nStories by Linda Dobson is great) and meet children and families who are <br/>\nhomeschooled, it may help them understand and give them a realistic feeling <br/>\nof what homeschooling is about.

Last January my<br/>\nhusband was in the garage working when he broke his leg at about 1:00am.<br/>\nI pulled the girls out of bed and took him to the emergency room. As the<br/>\nER doctor is looking my husband over, dd kept chatting with the doctor.<br/>\nShe wanted to know what happened. The doctor told her that he broke his<br/>\nleg. She wanted to know which bone. The doctor told her the one at the<br/>\nbottom. She wanted to know exactly which bone. The doctor had no interest<br/>\nin talking to her (understandably, as the ER was packed) When we finally<br/>\ngot home, the first thing she did was go get an anatomy book off her<br/>\nshelf. &quot;Now Mom, show me which bone.&quot; So we went all through the<br/>\nskeleton, and she made up a new and improved version of that song &quot;Dried<br/>\nbones&quot;(I think) using all the technical names of the bones. Then she<br/>\nwanted to look at the pictures of muscles. She started cracking up when<br/>\nlooking at the butt muscles, and wanted to know what they were called. I<br/>\ntold her that they were the gluteus maximus. She told me my gluteus<br/>\nmaximuses were big [thanks!] Ever since she has always just called buns<br/>\ngluteus maximus, and always giggles like crazy when saying it. And just<br/>\nimagine, she wouldn&#39;t be learning this stuff in school till what, 5th or<br/>\n6th grade?<br/>\nWende<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85 &lt;sheran@ptd.net&gt;","from":"&quot;kayb85 &lt;sheran@...&gt;&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Interrogated by a teacher and the unschooling term","postDate":"1042860959","msgId":55501,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGIwYWkzMCs2cjdxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE1ZS4xYTRjZmYzOS4yYjU5ZjJmYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55490,"nextInTopic":55503,"prevInTime":55500,"nextInTime":55502,"topicId":55411,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... children s ... eventually ...

He brings up the fact that he has worked in inner city schools where the schools have really helped some kids.   I try and agree with him on that and discuss things on more of a natural learning basis.   But it is still really difficult sometimes.      I feel like  he likes what he sees in our children but that he would be betraying the school system if he did it with his children??

She showed him the chickens<br/>\nshe was raising, the flowers and vegetables that she grew from seed,<br/>\nshowed him how to paint on the computer, how to make different colors on<br/>\nher real pallet, chatted, played, explored. She did all the things that<br/>\nshe will do on any given day.

And<br/>\nshe smiled all day.<br/>\nMe- Now you know why I homeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur teacher friend has never again questioned our homeschooling<br/>\nintentions, and often brings over surplus text books and workbooks for<br/>\nher.

I have<br/>\nonly told one sister, who had homeschooled her children for a while, and as<br/>\nI would have put it then, did &quot;nothing!&quot;  For some reason she feels that I<br/>\nmight understand her better now, lol.  Of course, I still feel like she<br/>\nshould have made more opportunities for her children, had more books around,<br/>\nreturned books to the library so they could go back, etc.  But, you know, in<br/>\nspite of all that, her children are probably the best educated in the family<br/>\nso far!<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t mentioned it to my parents.  They still don&#39;t agree with the<br/>\nhomeschooling, so unschooling is going to be way beyond their comprehension.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were home for Christmas, my dad kept bringing up things he knew that<br/>\nhe thought my children should know by now, but didn&#39;t.  His big one was<br/>\nsomething about how you can make a perfect star by drawing a circle and<br/>\nknowing the formula of how to divide it using a compass.  I &quot;casually&quot;<br/>\nmentioned how I had never done that (and I was the &quot;best&quot; in the family and<br/>\nthe first one in the family that graduated from college and took things like<br/>\ncalculus, of course I don&#39;t remember any of it, but that is a different<br/>\nstory.).  He kept saying HE learned how to do that in the fifth grade or<br/>\nsomething.  But of course, he couldn&#39;t remember how to do it, so went and<br/>\nlooked it up on the internet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he came back out with the directions, he sat and worked at it for a<br/>\nwhile and then said he was too tired, he would have to work on it in the<br/>\nmorning.  My daughter asked if she could use his compass and stuff.  He said<br/>\nit was okay.  She sat and played with the compass and other drafting<br/>\nequipment for an hour or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure if she figured out how to draw the star, but she learned a lot<br/>\njust doing stuff with the tools on her own.  My dad of course, had gone to<br/>\nbed, so he missed the light of discovery in her eyes as she compared radius<br/>\nand diameter, etc.  I didn&#39;t bring up the subject the next day, and my dad<br/>\ndidn&#39;t either, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, anyway, back to the subject.  I am not planning on telling anyone about<br/>\nthis anytime soon.  I plan on being very vague with everyone.

I mean, really questioning.  I think I came off as a little defensive, even though I don&#39;t feel that way.  I am very secure in our decision to unschool but it was very hard to explain the concept (she said she had never heard of it) and not take her questions personally.  Ugghhh!! <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter just started a cheerleading program at a local Baptist church....Upwards is the name of the program.  It is actually quite nice for a nonchurchy person.  My daughter has announced many times that she is a Christian and she can&#39;t really understand why my husband and I are not but that&#39;s another story........<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we joined late and my daughter(just turned 7) got to be on the same team with another friend who is in the 3rd grade.  They placed her with the 3rd and 4th graders instead of the 1st/2nd grade group.  I am fine with it.....Mady is fine with it......but the mothers keep asking me, &quot;Is she a 4th grader???&quot;  and it leads to the homeschooling discussions when I tell them she is 7 and not in a &#39;grade&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne mother asked the usual question, &quot;so,............what curriculum do you use?&quot;<br/>\nMe:  &quot;We don&#39;t use curriculum.&quot;<br/>\nHer:  &quot;Oh,......(long pause) we used Abeka for the girls until they were old enough to start school and it really gave them a good start.&quot;<br/>\nMe:  &quot;That&#39;s nice&quot;<br/>\nEnd of conversation.  Whew.   Survived the unending questions from her.  Then comes in mother #2.<br/>\n<br/>\nMother #2 is a special education teacher with 3 or 4 adopted children with various disabilities.  Her main question ( I initially took it as concern for what I am doing with my children) was how do they learn the BASICS??  Well, I gave her the &quot;from everyday life&quot; answer and she wanted more.  But HOW??   I said that I was secure and confident that my children would learn what they need when they need it.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I realized that maybe she really does want to understand the what, how, and why of what we are doing to incorporate that into her home life and/or her teaching methods.  Then I gave her the name of a couple of books that she could read to learn more.  She seemed receptive but she wanted more.  By now, I am starting to sweat.  She was interrogating me it seemed.  I was completely unprepared for this.  I started citing examples from our home, how Alex is &#39;doing math&#39; calculating allowance and figuring out the baseball card stuff, how he has asked for algebra books (though he hasn&#39;t really looked at them yet), how he learned to read by watching the TV Guide channel (looking for his favorite programs), etc......  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe didn&#39;t seem satisfied yet.   She still kept asking, &quot;but how do they get the foundation for later things if you don&#39;t TEACH them?&quot;   Her husband is a college professor who has a couple of homeschooled kids in his classes.  He said that it seemed the homeschooled ones don&#39;t seem to do well in the classroom situation.  They are having trouble getting used to the &#39;system&#39;.  I asked her if they wanted to BE there?  She didn&#39;t know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, I told her about my husband who quit high school at 17, never went to college, started as a janitor, and is now an engineer.  She said, &quot;well, he won&#39;t be able to get a job at another plant without his degree, will he?&quot;  I told her that &quot;actually, yes.  He&#39;s had many offers over the years from others who know him and have moved to other companies, from the sales guys he knows, etc.  We have had job opportunities in Mexico, Germany (we really wanted to go but it didn&#39;t work out), Texas, and South Carolina in the last 5 years.&quot;  I was a little snippy about that comment from her but I am so proud of what my husband has accomplished without college or a degree.  It proves (to me) that you CAN do whatever you want if you put forth the effort and you have a genuine desire to succeed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI finally ended the conversation by telling her that I feel confident that my children will learn what they need, when they need it.  That it is a factor of desire to know that drives their education and I believe they can do anything they want to as/when they grow.   <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, she asked if we had a church.  I just couldn&#39;t tell her that I am not a christian.  I was already exhausted from our first subject.  She invited me to come &quot;they have wonderful children&#39;s programs&quot; but all I could do was smile and nod and thank her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now I have survived my first interrogation by a teacher.  As I said earlier, I think I was a lot more defensive than I should have been but she just kept asking questions!  We were waiting for our children to finish cheer practice so there was no escape.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow I wished I had someone to call last night to vent this out of my system but I don&#39;t know any unschoolers personally.
