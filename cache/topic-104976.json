One morning a small kid got on, who was new <br/>\nin the neighborhood.  That afternoon, after he got in to go home, she ran her <br/>\nwhole route and he was still on the bus.  She asked him why he didn&#39;t get off <br/>\nand he said he didn&#39;t see his house. So, she drove the whole route again, <br/>\nasking him what color his house was, and then again, trying to keep him calm.

He&#39;d <br/>\nknown the phone number for a long time.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I was a teenager my mom told me a story about one of her first school  <br/>\nhumiliations, and it was kind of a stunner because it affected my life  <br/>\nnegatively, and so I used it to affect my own kids&#39; positively.  She said  she was <br/>\nsix or seven, and playing on the playground during recess, singing the  days of <br/>\nthe week the way her mom sang them to her at home.  The teacher  overheard, <br/>\nthought it was wonderful, and when they went inside, asked my mom to  sing it <br/>\nfor the whole class.<br/>\n <br/>\nShe didn&#39;t WANT to sing in front of the whole class.  She was really  self <br/>\nconscious for being poor and impermanent (her family picked cotton and  didn&#39;t <br/>\noften stay in one place long, living in cheap little rentals or  worse).  She <br/>\ndid, but it traumatized her, so she stuffed the whole thing  down.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I was a kid I struggled to learn the days of the week just by  <br/>\nrecitation.  I used to be confused in the middle, because they didn&#39;t make  any sense <br/>\nto me.  I asked her, those twelve years later, why she hadn&#39;t  taught ME that <br/>\nsong.  She didn&#39;t know.  Maybe because she had put it  where she didn&#39;t think <br/>\nof it, or maybe because she was afraid it would end up  getting me embarrassed.<br/>\n <br/>\nI taught it to my kids before they had any idea what it was about, using it  <br/>\nfor a tooth-brushing song for babies.  When they only had a very few teeth,  <br/>\nI&#39;d do one quadrant with each line. <br/>\n <br/>\nOh!  The tune is &quot;Yankee Doodle,&quot; so if you sing the days of the week  to <br/>\neach line of the song, you get four &#39;weeks,&#39; so the whole song is a month  long. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;   So as they came up old enough to wonder about the  order of the days, <br/>\nthey had that song already ingrained, and when they asked  what a month was, I <br/>\nsaid four weeks, like the song (and usually a few more days,  but four weeks <br/>\nexactly in February).<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen they got older we brushed teeth for TWO months, one month on one side  <br/>\nand one month on the other.  And if we weren&#39;t really done, the beginning  of <br/>\nthe last Saturday could be held out for a long, amusing time.    &quot;Thursday, <br/>\nFriday, Saa...............turday.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157714996,"authorName":"sharonjrt","from":"&quot;sharonjrt&quot; &lt;sharonjrt@...&gt;","profile":"sharonjrt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: My Life as a Musical","postDate":"1112016370","msgId":104979,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQyOTBsaStwM2VhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwMzI4MTIxNTU2LkNaSU8yMTkyLm10YTkuYWRlbHBoaWEubmV0QGxlaWdoPg=="},"prevInTopic":104978,"nextInTopic":104980,"prevInTime":104978,"nextInTime":104980,"topicId":104976,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"DD, DH & I are always putting life-situations into song.
