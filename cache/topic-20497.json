Let the kids set their own schedule. Let them sleep as long as they need to, get up, get themselves some breakfast (sometimes) and they can decide what they want to do that day...whether its read a book, watch a tv program, do a puzzle, bake, build something, play outside. It doesn&#39;t matter as long as they are enjoying what they are doing. Yes, you do need to be available...but the kids would also understand if you are in the middle of a project that needed to be done first. They don&#39;t mind waiting for a few minutes until you can give them your complete attention for a few. Naomi sleeps as long as she needs to and wakes, eats, does whatever she wants that day. It is different each day. On the days when we do have to go somewhere at a certain time...I get her up and we hit the road. Tomorrow is a big day for us since I will be at a seminar at the church so we will be there for breakfast and lunch and her big sister will meet her there and take her out to watch a movie.
