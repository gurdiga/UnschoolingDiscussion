I am<br/>\npretty familiar with public education from the 20&#39;s forward and<br/>\ncertainly have no illusions that there was ever a day of<br/>\nuniversal belles lettres.   But I was not referring to the<br/>\ncultural knowledge of the elite effete - but to the markers that<br/>\nlet you know you are part of a larger group and react as a<br/>\n&quot;member/guest&quot; rather than as &quot;unknown/other&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a time that enabling a child to identify the<br/>\njokes/inside lines/assumptions/taboos of the common (not the<br/>\nhigh) culture was seen as having value in education.  A person<br/>\nlearning a trade would be consciously instructed in the history<br/>\nand lore of the trade (thinking particularly of printers with<br/>\nwhom I am familiar).  A person whose community was limited to all<br/>\nmembers of one faith would learn the holidays and observances of<br/>\nthat faith.   etiquette, as practiced by the group of which you<br/>\nwere a member, was taught directly and as a valuable part of<br/>\nlearning, whether it was the mountain superstitious etiquette of<br/>\nentering and leaving by different doors or the copy book forms of<br/>\nintroductions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the world has become smaller and the common culture more<br/>\ndiverse, I think we have substituted political correctness for an<br/>\nhonest instruction on cultural connections.  School, especially<br/>\ngovernment school, intensify the effect because of their very<br/>\nbureaucratic nature.  The result seems to me to be the formation<br/>\nof a substitute common culture by age peers, to replace a sense<br/>\nof group that is not taught.  It is not an indictment of schools<br/>\nto say that they are doing what has been asked of them, but it is<br/>\na call the think clearly about what it is we are asking.  Whether<br/>\none is fortunate enough to have the resources (not necessarily a<br/>\nfinancial issue, so much as a disposition one) to allow children<br/>\nto learn their own way or whether one is packing a lunch and<br/>\nsending little Susie out the door every morning, we are all<br/>\nspending much of our time in common culture with the product of<br/>\nthat request to emphasize drug avoidance and diversity over the<br/>\ncues that tell us who we are.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Fetteroll&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 7:24 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] twelfth night<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| on 8/6/02 3:22 PM, Nora or Devereaux Cannon at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dcannon@...\">dcannon@...</a><br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n|<br/>\n| &gt; Because we have so institutionalized education through<br/>\ngovernment<br/>\n| &gt; schools<br/>\n|<br/>\n| I&#39;m still not sure at what point in time you&#39;re comparing<br/>\ntoday&#39;s education<br/>\n| to.
