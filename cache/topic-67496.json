A few months ago, Caeleb (22 months) <br/>\nwas watching one of those Baby Einstien movies and saw a baby.  I said, <br/>\n&#39;aww, look at the baby Caeleb!&#39;  He sat there for a moment and turned to <br/>\npoint to Chloe, his baby sister.  His little eyes lit up like he had it all <br/>\nfigured out!  For days, when he saw a baby, he would point to Chloe and the <br/>\ntv, making the connection.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing how much we miss sometimes.  I find that I have become so much <br/>\nmore aware of these little moments now that we are unschooling.  I seriously <br/>\ndoubt a few years ago, I would have thought of the fork balancing act as <br/>\nanything educational.  Which is sad because I&#39;m quite sure I missed many <br/>\nnatural lessons life was teaching us.
