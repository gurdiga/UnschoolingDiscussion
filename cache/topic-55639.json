We go through regular changes around here<br/>\nwith Dad home, Dad home plus holidays, and Dad gone, and I see different<br/>\nbehaviours that come with eat &quot;season&quot;.  Some are good things, some are more<br/>\nproblematic. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn particular to Rebecca&#39;s issue, I see a couple of things: it&#39;s been 4<br/>\nmonths that have included Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years.<br/>\nNot the calmest 4 months of the year!  Furthermore, changing the rules and<br/>\nliving calmly inside those new changes is one thing, but when outsiders like<br/>\ngrandparents and all make a big fuss that &quot;WOW, you can have CANDY&quot;, it&#39;s<br/>\nsuddenly a much bigger thing.  You might ask them to tame it down a bit, and<br/>\nmake sure they&#39;re not treating candy like it&#39;s anything more than another<br/>\nfood.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI bought two huge toblerone bars (400 grams each) at the after-holidays sale<br/>\na couple weeks ago.  One was unwrapped so we could admire its size, and both<br/>\nTim and I ate a piece.  That&#39;s all that&#39;s happened, and I&#39;ve always had a<br/>\nhuge sweet tooth.  But now that I&#39;ve stopped torturing myself about it and<br/>\neating candy when I want it, I don&#39;t want it often.  I just gave a way a<br/>\nbunch of cookies that were going stale.  The neighbor kids think I&#39;m<br/>\nwonderful now.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55625,"nextTopicId":55563}}
