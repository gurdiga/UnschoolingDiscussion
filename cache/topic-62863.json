I don&#39;t tell my boys anything.  They decide everything.  What, <br/>\nwhen, <br/>\nhow much food to eat.  And they are great at it.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty and I just got back from the breakfast buffet at Shoney&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had a check-up this morning, as we needed the doctor to sign off on a form <br/>\nfor him to apply for the Junior Police Academy this summer.   It was the <br/>\nfirst time he had been to the doctor since he got a tetanus shot at 9.  He&#39;s <br/>\n14.    I reminded him that when he got a shot we offered to take him out for <br/>\nice cream, and so asked if he wanted to go out to breakfast.<br/>\n<br/>\nTruth was, I was hungry.  He got up early on his own and the rest were asleep <br/>\nanyway.  And we were having good conversations.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo.  Growing fourteen year old boy who just got a &quot;strong as a rock&quot; checkup. <br/>\n Unlimited breakfast.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe got a Dr Pepper to drink.   I got tomato juice.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe got one plate, not too full, eggs, biscuit, gravy, potatoes, two pieces of <br/>\nbacon and one link sausage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was all.  We ate.  Talked.  Sat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI asked if he wanted to go back for seconds.  He said &quot;I was thinking about <br/>\nit.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI reminded him he had first said he wanted to go where they had pancakes.  So <br/>\nhe got pancakes, but said they weren&#39;t so good, so left most of them on the <br/>\nplate.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is not desperate for food.  Good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to keep his napkin but he wadded it up.  While I was at the <br/>\nbathroom, he was putting some mathematical notation of his own devising, <br/>\nmostly, something about how stats and encounters are to work in a new <br/>\nwestern-scenario online RPG he and a friend are designing.   He said &quot;Plain <br/>\nmath is so pretty.  I really like it.&quot;   And by that he seemed to mean that <br/>\nthe way logic lays out on paper is attractive to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the two formulas he was writing were symbolic.  All, maybe.  It was <br/>\nhit points and adjustments and relationships to the opponent&#39;s strengths.  In <br/>\nletters with function and relationship symbols.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor something he was writing the abbreviation and putting a little plus sign <br/>\nbelow and to the right.  Not quite where subscripts go, but right underneath. <br/>\n I asked if that was just a symbol he made up or something common to gaming.  <br/>\nHe said he made it up to mean that amount or more.  So I showed him the <br/>\nsymbols for equal or greater and equal or less.   He found that pretty AND <br/>\nuseful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also told him to show that stuff to his dad who could show him some <br/>\nprogramming symbols.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I told him I found musical notation really pretty and elegant.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could have gone, but when the waitress asked if he wanted more Dr Pepper <br/>\nhe said yes.   We have DP at home.  He was having fun sitting and talking to <br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he didn&#39;t look at me for permission to say yes, which seemed an indicator <br/>\nthat he felt whole in the situation too.  And it was his post-doctor-visit <br/>\nactivity, too, so it was &quot;his turn&quot; in that way, I suppose.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we were leaving the restaurant, though, he said &quot;I just LOVE math.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCool!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62817,"nextTopicId":62895}}
