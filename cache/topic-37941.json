Thanks, BTW!<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, there&#39;s an unschooled soap star who&#39;ll tell her story. I grew up with <br/>\nher. Fiona was not schooled until fourth grade (when/where we met) because <br/>\nshe lived in Jamaica. She attended school from 4th-7th grade and then she was <br/>\ntrusted to even live on her own in London and New York at 14. Fascinating <br/>\nstory. As soon as I &quot;found&quot; unschooling, I realized she was my personal <br/>\nposter child for unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll also have Ned Vare and Luz Shosie whose son will graduate from college <br/>\nnext week. Cassidy, their son, never went to school; he won&#39;t be with us, but <br/>\nhis parents should be able to answer all those questions you might have.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you can join us!<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy, Coordinator<br/>\nSchools Out Support<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:coordinator@...\">coordinator@...</a><br/>\n803-776-4849<br/>\nFax: 803-776-7006<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org\">http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37904,"nextTopicId":37930}}
