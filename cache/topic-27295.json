Please pardon duplicates you may receive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much!<br/>\nBest to you and yours,<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n----------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings,<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter three long years I have convinced a publisher that the<br/>\nhomeschooling community has the ability and desire to create the<br/>\nultimate &quot;learning ideas&quot; book, a much needed alternative or supplement<br/>\nto traditional learning methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal? To gather in one place the neatest, coolest, cheapest,<br/>\nweirdest, quickest, funniest, most exotic, exciting, and fun learning<br/>\nactivities we homeschooling families have created ? or joyfully<br/>\nstumbled<br/>\nupon ? outside of or alongside text book studies. We&#39;ll be focusing on<br/>\nideas for use with (about) 3- to 12-year-olds.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour participation, as always, is warmly invited ? simply send an email<br/>\nto <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ldobson@...\">ldobson@...</a> with &quot;Idea Book&quot; as the subject. In return<br/>\nyou&#39;ll receive all of the information you need to submit your greatest<br/>\nideas, and my everlasting gratitude. Additionally, there&#39;s a copy of<br/>\nthe<br/>\nbook for those contributors who submit five or more published ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore importantly, though, we&#39;ll help put the joy and fun of learning<br/>\ninto even more children&#39;s lives, and that will be a gift to them that<br/>\nkeeps on giving.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease feel free to share this announcement on other lists where you<br/>\nthink it is appropriate. I look forward to hearing from you!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor HEM&#39;s current Editorial Guidelines send a message to <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM-Editor@...\">HEM-Editor@...</a> with the word &#39;Guidelines&#39; in the <br/>\nsubject line!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this list: mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM-Writers-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">HEM-Writers-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
