And yes, you are right it does fall under the<br/>\n&quot;Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus&quot;! :) One of my favorite books....<br/>\nWhen I read it, it makes me cry! :) \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI understand that of your cousin&#39;s situation, as well. Believe it or not, my<br/>\nparents were also physical and emotionally and mentally abusive too. My<br/>\nmother used to beat me with anything she could find - a shoe, a belt buckle<br/>\nor her favorite was for me to find my &quot;switch&quot; from this long tall purple<br/>\ntree in our front yard with long thin branches. My father, he was and still<br/>\nis emotionally abusive. His words cut like a knife to me as a young<br/>\nimpressionable young girl.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt took counseling when I was 13 (after my mother was attempting to beat me<br/>\nin the kitchen with a shoe and I grabbed a knife in self defense), for us to<br/>\nget past the physical abuse, and she then never laid a hand on me again. And<br/>\nshould would never even dream of doing so with my children, as she is<br/>\ngetting her &quot;second chance&quot; as she puts it to make things right.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy father, is my father, and I have accepted that he is who he is. He<br/>\ncontinues to abuse me in this way even today. When I have stronger days, I<br/>\nstand up to him, other days it is harder when I am sick (I have just been<br/>\ndiagnosed with Lupus and Thrombophilia or sticky blood as it is called) but<br/>\noverall I try not to let his words pierce me and I have learned too that I<br/>\ncannot change him, only change myself and my reaction or non-reaction to it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo I can relate very much to your cousin. But somehow, for me, despite the<br/>\nabuses going on, there were good times I remember and my feelings about<br/>\nSanta never changed, I just love the spirit and meaning behind Santa, as I<br/>\nwrote! :) Has your cousin been able to work through the issues?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo, yes, Angela, there is a Santa Claus! :)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThanks for making my day sweeter by your kind words!:)\r<br/>\n------Original Message----\r<br/>\nMessage: 4\r<br/>\n   Date: Fri, 23 Jul 2004 08:03:13 -0400\r<br/>\n   From: &quot;Angela&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\nSubject: RE: Re: Santa....a different view\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nPatti,\r<br/>\nWhat you wrote was beautiful and also the theme behind &quot;yes Virginia, there\r<br/>\nis a Santa Claus&quot;, which I love and plan to share with my children at some\r<br/>\npoint.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI also wanted to mention that the cousin I mentioned who felt so betrayed by\r<br/>\nher parents also had a LOT of other issues with regards to her parent&#39;s\r<br/>\nparenting.  So, it&#39;s not like the Santa issue was the only thing she was\r<br/>\nlied to about.  There was both physical and mental abuse to go with it.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nAngela\r<br/>\n  &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a>&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a>\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n  Patti wrote:\r<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;\r<br/>\nSanta may not be real in the sense of we cannot feel, touch, smell, taste or\r<br/>\nhear him BUT we can believe in what he is in our hearts - a sense of\r<br/>\ninnocence, a sense of awe and wonder at life and of life and in life.\r<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nAnd Rebeca wrote:\r<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;\r<br/>\nI have friends who were terribly bothered by their parent&#39;s\r<br/>\n&#39;lies&#39; about Santa.
