Don&#39;t see turning it<br/>\noff anytime soon. Figures. I made sure I was ready for the cold weather this<br/>\nyear. Every year I don&#39;t worry about cold weather clothes for the kids. And<br/>\nevery year when it gets cold for awhile, I&#39;m stuck in finding anything for<br/>\nthem to wear. Usually by that time, the stores start having spring fashions<br/>\nout. So this year I prepared early. Each kid is set with long pants and<br/>\nsweaters and even gloves this year. The kids complained last year at sports<br/>\ncamp that it was hard to run with their hands in their pockets. So far it&#39;s<br/>\nall just been sitting in the closets.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8151304,"authorName":"rubyprincesstsg@aol.com","from":"rubyprincesstsg@...","profile":"rubyprincesstsg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Night wetting /Julie S. ducking!...","postDate":"1073273568","msgId":87849,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwMi4zYzBjODU0YS4yZDJhMzRlMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":87844,"nextInTopic":87854,"prevInTime":87848,"nextInTime":87850,"topicId":87691,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/4/2004 10:28:26 PM Eastern Standard Time, pamsoroosh@mac.com writes: In VA it was near 80 today (77 around noon, the last time I checked).","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2009972549\">In a message dated 1/4/2004 10:28:26 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a> writes:<br/>\nIn VA it was near 80 today (77 around noon, the last time I checked).  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; By<br/>\n&gt; Friday morning it&#39;s supposed to be 12 degrees FREEZING!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yikes.
