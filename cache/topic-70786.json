During dinner they talked about these teens like they were nothing but work and stress. Now I know nothing about their children or them but was struck by the negativity around the &quot;teen thing&quot; and also a bit shocked that they had to put them to bed. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had set bedtimes but based on when the kids really indicate being tired. We have relaxed some on the urgency of them following this to the minute. When we arrived home at 10 pm our sons 11 and 7 had put themselves to bed as well as the 12 yr old. Our 14 yr old was up in her room doing her own thing. Our only request for our 14 yr old when we go out is for her to be aware of safety and act if an emergency occurred. Other than that we ask them all to be responsible for their own choices of behaviour and that they respect and not hurt each other. We have yet to come home to any major issue. For some reason they honour our trust just as we honour theirs by checking in and coming home when stated. This might sound like bragging but really this is a celebration of just how beautifully unschooling and trusting parenting is working for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nTim and Maureen Thomas<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stillwaters.ca\">http://www.stillwaters.ca</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70479,"nextTopicId":70763}}
