My son was into magic a couple of years <br/>\nago. He was incredible! But during the learning stages, he would get SOOO <br/>\nfrustrated. I taped him. Later when he would have a lot of trouble learning <br/>\nsomething new, I&#39;d play back the tape and show him how well he had mastered <br/>\nsome old manipulation. He could SEE the difference, because he had mastered <br/>\nthat particular move. It calmed him and lessened his frustrations. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow he&#39;s skateboarding. He&#39;s having trouble with some moves. HE has taped <br/>\nearlier attempts to prove to himself he was improving. It helps his OWN <br/>\nfeelings of insecurity as he&#39;s learning something new or more difficult. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t matter what I say---it&#39;s never quite enough. He was (is) one of <br/>\nthose kids that won&#39;t &quot;do&quot; it until he&#39;s sure he&#39;ll be able to. <br/>\n(Talking/walking/reading/etc.), so we just go with the flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the hardest things about school is that they pushed before he was <br/>\nready. If they could have waited---just a day or two----he would have been <br/>\nconfident that it was possible and not have gotten so frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d recommend a tape recorder or video camera---especially for <br/>\n&quot;perfectionists&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85994576,"authorName":"Kolleen","from":"Kolleen &lt;Kolleen@...&gt;","profile":"kaydeecross","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: frustration","postDate":"1012347345","msgId":31790,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMTI5MjMzNC5nMFROWWlFRTAyNDcxNEBueWNzbXRwMm91dC5yZGMtbnljLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":31788,"nextInTopic":46880,"prevInTime":31789,"nextInTime":31791,"topicId":31753,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
