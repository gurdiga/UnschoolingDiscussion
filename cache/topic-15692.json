Looks as if the religious discussion has died down a<br/>\nbit. Now, I don&#39;t know if this is an ignorant question about Catholics and<br/>\nbirth control or what, but I&#39;ll ask it anyway. LOL. When you say birth<br/>\ncontrol is a venial sin, do you mean artificial forms like condoms, birth<br/>\ncontrol pills, etc.? Since natural family planning is a form of birth<br/>\ncontrol and is used by many Catholic (and non-Catholic) families I know, I&#39;m<br/>\nassuming that&#39;s okay.
