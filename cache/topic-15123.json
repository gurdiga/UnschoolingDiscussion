If you&#39;re unsure of the <br/>\n  difference, please <br/>\n  &gt; take a time out and familiarize yourself.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &quot;Fundamentalist Christian&quot; does mean fanatic, I&#39;m afraid.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If a fundamentalist Christian is someone who adheres to the <br/>\n  fundamentals of Christianity, then I am a fundamentalist.  If a <br/>\n  Christian fanatic is someone who is a big fan of Christ, I don&#39;t mind <br/>\n  being a fanatic.  I do mind being called a fanatic if by fanatic you <br/>\n  mean someone who is irrational.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; It&#39;s not hard to go online, using www.google.com if you want, or <br/>\n  just poke <br/>\n  &gt; from one Christian homeschooling site to another for a while, and <br/>\n  find that <br/>\n  &gt; unschooling will be characterized as neglect, as leaving children <br/>\n  to be <br/>\n  &gt; raised by themselves, as giving children the rule in the home (a <br/>\n  sin), and so <br/>\n  &gt; forth.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think that many Christians just don&#39;t understand completely what <br/>\n  unschooling is.  I think that Christians (and people in general) <br/>\n  think that unschoolers just don&#39;t do anything with their kids all day <br/>\n  and let their kids run wild.  They don&#39;t understand that we spend a <br/>\n  lot of time doing stuff with them all day long and have a huge <br/>\n  influence in their lives because we are so close to them.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  But just because Abeka and Bob Jones are more popular than <br/>\n  unschooling among fundamental Christians doesn&#39;t mean that <br/>\n  unschooling is something that fundamentalist Christians can&#39;t do.  I <br/>\n  am a fundamentalist Christian and an unschooler.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  It is very possible to believe in a young earth, in a literal 6 24 <br/>\n  hour day creation, and to believe in salvation only Jesus Christ and <br/>\n  still unschool.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

We do most of<br/>\nthe PT/OT therapy at home (or at the Y) ourselves, though we did start<br/>\nworking with a speech therapy program at the local University when Graham<br/>\nstarted to talk- he enjoys it very much, so it has worked out well, it&#39;s a<br/>\ngroup situation working in a &#39;natural&#39; setting instead of the typical<br/>\ntherapy sessions.  At this point we are concentrating on incorporating<br/>\nST/PT/OT type work in play settings that he is interested in.  We do a<br/>\nspecial needs swim class at the Y, and open gym time, both of which he<br/>\nloves.  We also plan to try hippotherapy this Spring instead of more<br/>\ntraditional OT work.
