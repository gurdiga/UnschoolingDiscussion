Kinda half awake.  My son, when he finally stopped wetting the bed, said the exact same thing--that he had learned to sleep differently.  He was actually pretty tired the first week after he figured this out, but I think just getting to bed a little earlier helped with that.  When George told me he was tired of wetting the bed (pull-up things were uncomfortable, waking up wet and having to change clothes and move to another bed was no fun), I offered suggestions and he liked the idea of an enuresis alarm.   When we got it, he wore it one or two nights, and had it figured out.  I so wish they had had these things when I was a kid!  I remember my mother telling me there were alarms when I was a little girl, but they were pads you slept on and they had an electrical cord attached.  My mother explained that she wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep worrying about me getting electricuted!    The little Malen alarm I bought for my son was safe and little and he was physically and mentally ready for it.    The medicine (vasopressin or DDAVP) can be given by pill or nasal spray, but I was nervous about it.  But not as nervous as my mom was about those electrically charged pads &lt;g&gt;, and we would have done that if that&#39;s what my son had wanted to try.  <br/>\n    I want my kids to think I will search out solutions to their problems when they ask for my assistance, but that I can also leave it alone if things are good enough for them.    <br/>\nDeirdre<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am a quiet list member but this thread really caught my eye.

My 10 yo <br/>\ndaughter still wets the bed and it bothers her very badly.  She is too <br/>\nbig for the traditional kid goodnights so we have gone to the adult <br/>\nDepends.  My older daughter wet until she was 10 and then only had <br/>\noccassional accidents until she was 11 yo.  My yougest (10 yo) also wears <br/>\nthe smaller depends pads during the day because sometimes she can&#39;t make <br/>\nit to the bathroom.  I haven&#39;t really worried about it becuase my now 13 <br/>\nyo was put through several invasive tests (that I wish now I had never <br/>\ndone, but thought there might be something really wrong because she would <br/>\nleak during the day too)and ended up having her urethera tube stretched <br/>\nwhich helped for about 6 or 7 months.  I decided at that point after <br/>\ntalking with my MIL not to do that again either.  My SIL had hers <br/>\nstretched 9 times as a child.  She eventually grew out of it.  So I <br/>\ndecided to buy pads and let her grow out of it.  The thing that concerns <br/>\nme with Madison (my 10 yo) is that it bothers her so badly.  We have <br/>\ntalked about it and I have told her not to worry.  She has even asked her <br/>\ndaddy and me to wake her during the night to go pee.  We do that a fair <br/>\namount.  But after reading some of the posts I am wondering if that is <br/>\nsomething we should continue.  I wet the bed until I ws 9yo.  I just hope <br/>\nMadison&#39;s will resolve itself in the near future for her emotional sake.  <br/>\n<br/>\nReading your posts just lets me know we are not alone....<br/>\n<br/>\n~Tracey I.

He was in school for a year and a half and <br/>\nhas been home for almost a year now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRight after he started Kindergarten (age 6), he went through spurts <br/>\nwith wetting the bed, having accidents maybe 3 or 4 or 5 times a <br/>\nweek.

A doctor told me it was just how he <br/>\nwas growing, perhaps his bladder was a step behind his &quot;growth spurts&quot; <br/>\nand I was also told it was hormonal.

I don&#39;t have time to read all the past posts <br/>\nright now but this thing on bedwetting caught my attention because <br/>\nboth my boys had the problem.  There is a hormone that we produce that <br/>\ncauses us to wake up when our bladders are full.  Some people don&#39;t <br/>\nproduce enough of this hormone to wake them up, especially young boys <br/>\nhave this problem.  My boys wore pull-ups until they were 10 and about <br/>\n8.  We never made an issue out of it and if they were staying at <br/>\nsomeones house or someone was spending the night at our house we made <br/>\nsure that it was hidden so they wouldn&#39;t feel bad about it or get <br/>\nteased.  When my oldest hit around 10 and my other one was around 8 <br/>\nthey just started waking up.  I&#39;ve heard of kids being MUCH older than <br/>\nthat, my husband was probably about 12 before he quit wetting and in <br/>\nthose days they didn&#39;t even have pull-ups.
