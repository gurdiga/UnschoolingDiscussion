I&#39;m sure <br/>\nhe would have started in on breastfeeding, if he knew Nicky had &quot;still&quot; <br/>\nbeen breastfeeding.  (I&#39;ve been glad I never had to deal with getting that <br/>\nchallenge about breastfeeding.  I have heard them do it to another mom and <br/>\nI defended her.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far Nicky&#39;s permanent teeth seem fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n(OK, I&#39;m used to unschooling and breastfeeding not being in spell check, <br/>\nbut &quot;utero?&quot;)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107333,"nextTopicId":107352}}
