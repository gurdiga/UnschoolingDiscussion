The guy who <br/>\nplayed Mordred was unfamiliar to me and I was surprised to see how many films he <br/>\nwas in.   He died in 2003, while working on a film, but I thought some of the <br/>\nobituary material was pretty interesting!      Look him up at IMBD to see what <br/>\nmovies he was in, and I&#39;ve lifted a bit from the obituary that was here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/12/05/db0501.xml&\">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/12/05/db0501.xml&</a><br/>\nsSheet=/portal/2003/12/05/ixportal.html<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was a musical and artistic prodigy, so this all didn&#39;t happen *because* he <br/>\nquit going to school, but it&#39;s just one more example of someone for whom <br/>\nschool would NOT have been a benefit, considering all he learned and accomplished <br/>\nwithout it.   <br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Leslie Edward Hemmings was born at Guildford on November 18 1941. <br/>\nAlthough he was sent to Glyn College, Epsom, Hemmings later remarked: &quot;You can <br/>\ncount the days I went to school after the age of eight on your hands and feet. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t regret it.&quot; David&#39;s father had been a dance band pianist and encouraged <br/>\nhis son to sing.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hemmings was nine when he first sang for Benjamin Britten. For three years <br/>\nhe toured in The Turn Of The Screw, until his voice finally broke during a high <br/>\naria on stage at the Champs Elysee Theatre in Paris. His understudy had been <br/>\nwaiting, in full costume, throughout these three years, and was brought on <br/>\nafter a brief interlude; alas, his voice broke three days later.<br/>\n<br/>\n At 12 Hemmings had begun acting in films. He left home at 14, had his own <br/>\nflat in London the next year and, by the time he made Blow-Up, he had 48 (mostly <br/>\nforgettable) films under his belt - including Otto Preminger&#39;s St Joan <br/>\n(1957). He was one of the original residents of Swinging London. &quot;John Lennon gave <br/>\nme my first joint,&quot; he recalled.<br/>\n<br/>\n At the end of the 1960s he left London for a holiday in the Seychelles and <br/>\nended up working in Australia and New Zealand, making more than 20 films.<br/>\n<br/>\n================    Interesting life of someone I&#39;d never heard of before.   <br/>\n================<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107901,"nextTopicId":108369}}
