Most <br/>\nsaid that they thought being strong academically was &#39;gay&#39; or &#39;girly&#39;. <br/>\nHowever, in individual interviews, boys said they were anxious about not <br/>\nmaking the grade and many were resentful towards teachers who they said <br/>\nfavoured girls.Being &#39;hard&#39; or &#39;cool&#39; was also very important, and <br/>\nresearchers discovered that popularity was often gauged on how tough or <br/>\nanti-adult individuals appeared. Football, whether following a team or <br/>\nplaying the sport, was an important topic for many who were interviewed and <br/>\nan indicator of how masculine an individual was considered to be. The &#39;absent <br/>\nfather&#39; syndrome was also apparent -- a third specifically mentioned that <br/>\ntheir mothers were more available to them than their fathers. It is hoped <br/>\nthat the results will help influence teachers and social policy <br/>\nmakers.Professor Stephen Frosh, who led the research, said the results showed <br/>\nthat boys had a lot to offer when given the chance. He said: &#39;On their own, <br/>\nthey were surprisingly willing to be truthful and thoughtful about their <br/>\nrelation ships and problems. &#39;Boys have a lot of confusion about how to get <br/>\nwhat they want and still keep their masculine image.&#39;Boys are much more artic <br/>\nulate than they are given credit for and there are lessons to be learned <br/>\nthere for social policy makers. Instead of always pushing boys towards sport, <br/>\nthey should be given a way to do well academically without stigma.&#39; A <br/>\nspokesman for the Educ ational Institute of Scotland said the research <br/>\nhighlighted the problems that boys can suffer in the classroom. He said: &#39;For <br/>\na number of years, the issue of maintaining the interest of teenage boys in <br/>\neducation has been recognised as a problem area. &#39;Different rates of matur <br/>\nation, peer group pressure and the perception that learning is not a <br/>\nmasculine activity can all contribute to boys being left behind in comparison <br/>\nto girls.&#39;Alleviating the shortage of male role models in education -- both <br/>\nat home and in the classroom, including the shortage of male teachers -- <br/>\ncould go some way towards tackling the problem and help close the gender gap <br/>\nwhich currently exists.&#39;Anne Houston, director of ChildLine Scotland, said <br/>\nthe research supported the organisation&#39;s efforts to encourage boys to open <br/>\nup -- even at an early age. &#39;We receive three times as many calls from girls <br/>\nas we do from boys,&#39; she said. &#39;They need to know it is okay to talk about <br/>\ntheir problems. &#39;Boys seem to wait for help to come to them, leading to <br/>\nfrustration in a lot of cases, and they act it out by getting into trouble. <br/>\n&#39;From very early, boys bottle problems up and don&#39;t reach out for help, which <br/>\nsadly is a precursor to the very high number of suicides we see in young <br/>\nmen.&#39;Dr Mark Hamilton, co- presenter of the Radio One Sunday Surgery <br/>\nprogramme, said the study results did not surprise him. &#39;This mirrors what I <br/>\nremember from my peer group,&#39; he said. &#39;Something that continually baffles me <br/>\nis that boys stick to the rebel image, but society emulates the rebels. &#39;In <br/>\nterms of education, it makes it very difficult for boys to concentrate on <br/>\ntheir work when they are nervous about being labelled a geek or a swot.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57714,"nextTopicId":57728}}
