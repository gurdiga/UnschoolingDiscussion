He knows all of his letters, but he doesn&#39;t know how to spell<br/>\nyet. My question for the group is how to approach this. I don&#39;t want to<br/>\ncorrect him, because I feel that might be discouraging, but I&#39;m afraid<br/>\nif I let him continue to spell things wrong, he will think he&#39;s right.<br/>\nWhat would you do?<br/>\n<br/>\nGotta go...he just spelled the word &quot;Chair&quot; (antyooohtrszgh...that<br/>\nspells CHAIR!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOH, another thing is that he reads the words backwords. Like when he<br/>\nsees a sign, he reads the letters backwards. For instance, riding in the<br/>\ncart at Target, he spelled &quot;TEGRAT...what does that spell, mama?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I just relax and let him do his thing? argh!<br/>\n<br/>\nlivelifelove<br/>\nLainie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12107,"nextTopicId":12111}}
