It asked me &quot;Style of Schooling.&quot;  I didn&#39;t know what to put and I felt kind of awkward.  I wondered, &quot;Am I doing this right because I don&#39;t really fit in anywhere.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I decided to write: I haven&#39;t really thought about it.  Hmmm I guess we are just your average homeschooling family.  Semi-structured. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Crystal and I have 3 boys 16mos, 3, 11 and I&#39;m so excited because now I fit in...I think.  Your description describes our family to a T- right now anyway.  I guess I&#39;m sorry of flopping back and forth between structured and unstructured.  For us, each activity has an educational purpose but our children lead the way.  It&#39;s up to me to be aware of their learning style and immediate interests so I may provide them with the resources so they can enjoy and benefit from their next learning journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nI joined this group because I&#39;d like to understand where I fit in and offer my children some new resources.... sometimes I run out of ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening,<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal<br/>\nHomeschooling On A Budget<br/>\n***********************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nExchange time & money saving tips, low cost educational ideas, activities & resources<br/>\nwith homeschooling families interested in providing a quality education for less.<br/>\nSubscribe today! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HS-For-Less-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">HS-For-Less-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Pam Hartley <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, June 04, 2001 11:27 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Doubts<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ----------<br/>\n  &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  &gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1289<br/>\n  &gt;Date: Mon, Jun 4, 2001, 7:57 PM<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I know that unschooling is the right choice for my son, but I many doubts<br/>\n  &gt; about myself - am I patient enough, organised enough, dedicated enough,<br/>\n  &gt; selfless enough to do it.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I would really like to hear what other people do.
