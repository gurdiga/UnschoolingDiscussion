Or letting the kiddos make some?  Just trace around the pictures on animal feed sacks or in your favorite books if you feel insecure free-hand drawing. Maybe scan the coloring book pictures that they like and then add your own dots and numbers (or ABCs)  Or use shapes to construct pictures.......just cut out a bunch of paper shapes then move them around into pictures like a puzzel....then glue.  Or just use any old picture and make the dots and number them yourself.  Then you can have a picture of something that YOUR child likes.  Scan it to make a bunch.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are sites that have this sort of thing, (PBS for example)  but it is actually quicker to make your own.  And you can do it with your notebook, that you always carry for entertaining the children,while waiting for appointments or other places where you are supposed to hang out for what seems like a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some suggestions<br/>\n<br/>\nSharon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
