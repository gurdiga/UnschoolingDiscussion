All of that leads quite naturally to unschooling, I think,<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s  built on trusting your children. I&#39;ve also had a copy of &quot;The<br/>\nAware baby&quot; on my bookshelf for 13 years (you started ahead of me ;-), and<br/>\nhave given it as a blessing way gift more than once. There are also some<br/>\narticles of Aletha&#39;s you can print out that I&#39;ve handed to parents I see<br/>\nstruggling with new ones. I can also relate to your mother not quite getting<br/>\nwhy you would be holding a screaming infant-my mother, after dd #2 had been<br/>\nat it for an hour, then stopped, said &quot;have I gone deaf, or did she<br/>\nstop...&quot;! I also heard just give her a pacifier (yuck), put her down or<br/>\nyou&#39;ll be that baby&#39;s slave, let her cry herself to sleep, blah, blah, blah.<br/>\nI have a friend who always says they were born at home, why would I send<br/>\nthem anywhere to learn? so I&#39;ve always seen homebirth and then homeschool as<br/>\na natural transition. Always unschooled, although I&#39;ve learned alot since<br/>\nreading this list, and have been able to trust them on an even deeper level.<br/>\nIsn&#39;t being a parent just an incredible rush? I cannot imagine anything I&#39;d<br/>\nrather do...well, an occasional pedicure does make me a really happy mama.<br/>\nRobyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59804,"nextTopicId":59841}}
