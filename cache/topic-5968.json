NYC!  I lost a digest (eaten by my computer, I guess), so I hope no one asked me to respond to anything in particular.<br/>\n<br/>\n   We had a great trip and ended up staying in a little relatively inexpensive hotel on East 57th Street that is being refurbished.  I suppose next time we go back the rates will have soared.  As it was, we had a tiny corner room (two windosw!) overlooking Lexington Avenue and they upgraded us, for free, to having a bathroom!  It was a great place to return to at night.  <br/>\n<br/>\n   My older daughter, 19, will be moving to NYC for a year very shortly (in the next few weeks).  She attended a Waldorf school through 7th grade, then unschooled the rest of her time at home, getting very involved in a homeschool theater group we started.  She is adamant about not wanting to go to college, but she isn&#39;t certain at this point what it is she&#39;d like to do.  I think NYC will be quite an experience for her.  <br/>\n<br/>\n   That means our youngest daughter, 17, will be an only child for awhile--a really sad thought. At least they both like to write, so I imagine letters and packages will be flying thick and fast between here and NY.  I thought I was fine with the move--happy and excited for her--and then we watched some old family videos a few nights ago.  I started getting this funny feeling in my chest and several times since then I&#39;ve suddenly gotten very teary.  All those wonderful years are gone....sob, sob.  Ah, well.  I just have to tell myself that there are other, different, wonderful years to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5985,"nextTopicId":5955}}
