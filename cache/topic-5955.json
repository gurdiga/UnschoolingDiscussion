I too checked out the Antioch program<br/>\nand had a personality conflict with a woman who runs the Waldorf way she<br/>\nactually physically dragged me out of a class I was sitting in on due to her<br/>\nagenda that I go to some other activity she had planned and I was in the<br/>\nmiddle of talking to someone etc. I was over 35 at the time and she was<br/>\ntreating me as if I were an adolescent in a regular  IS Jr. High! I was in<br/>\nshock and turned off to anything further but would love to get as much out<br/>\nof them as a resource. Oak meadow told me they are having a sale in March<br/>\nBTW for anyone interested. I don&#39;t have the money to invest in their yearly<br/>\ncurriculum but would love to read them or borrow or purchase resale if you<br/>\nknow of any for sale. Also do you still do the silk puppet troupe thing?<br/>\nThat must have been a great experience for you . I love to go see these<br/>\nshows and watch the effect they have on myself and my children it is so<br/>\nmystical and empowering of the imagination. I think we always leave them<br/>\nfeeling something indescribable in words but definitely a creative spiritual<br/>\nand soothing learning experience for the audience at any age.<br/>\nBeth<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:beth2002@...\">beth2002@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"silvertree","from":"&quot;silvertree&quot; &lt;silvertree@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"m1Ocj1HVIDyKGgU_AUO4pZdxZQ7wDe1UyorW_e873fIBaKKZJ12agFxU7aDAwyJ5_1PHumj_z6g3Jn5NY1GizVt2Stolw8kmIQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Oak Meadow/Unschooling","postDate":"949268582","msgId":5955,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zOTEuNTk1NS45NTkyNjk3NDZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5958,"prevInTime":5954,"nextInTime":5956,"topicId":5955,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Beth, I can see that we have alot in common!

My dd went to a waldorf kindergarden<br/>\nin RI.  It was something I was so drawn to because of the beauty and healing<br/>\natmosphere that emanates from them...very clear and holistic.  I went to the<br/>\nWaldorf Antioch Teacher Training program in NH and thought that we would<br/>\nsend dd to a waldorf school. We actually even had a waldor initiative here<br/>\nin CT that didn&#39;t quite make it.  We were working on founding a democratic<br/>\nschool (like Sudbury) when there was a split in the group and some parents<br/>\nasked me to help get a waldorf school going...long story.  Anyway we made a<br/>\nvery long trek to a waldorf school for 2 years to the kindergarden...it was<br/>\nwonderful and echoed the philosophy of how we were raising our dd.  We even<br/>\nbegan a silk marrionette puppetry troupe that presented plays at the school<br/>\nand for the community as a way to live more deeply with story.  When it came<br/>\ntime to go to the first grade, dd said pretty adamantly that she wanted to<br/>\nhomeschool...so we agreed.  We had always had out feet in both<br/>\nworlds...homeschooling was something we were involved with in terms of<br/>\ngroups, friends.  I was even getting HEM before daughter was born at home.<br/>\nIt was in 1986 and those issues are alot different than what they have<br/>\ntoday!!   So, I did get Oakmeadow...for a few years...we never really used<br/>\nmuch of it...the only thing that we did really use was the introduction of<br/>\nletters with stories and a beautiful book that we made.  We are unschoolers<br/>\nand a curriculum was always in the way.  I think I bought it because I was<br/>\njust always connected to waldorf ideals and found the resource somewhat<br/>\ncompelling.  Dd is now 12 1/2...we have a 6th grade Oak Meadow<br/>\ncurriculum...which she picks up occassionally to do some assignment out of.<br/>\nIt&#39;s always something she decides on her own.  I find her of late wanting<br/>\nsomehow more a structure in her life in terms of academic pursuits but, I<br/>\nthink it is just a feeling her ways in this time of beginning adolescense<br/>\nand change.  Again, a trying it out kind of thing.  I think the key is<br/>\noffering up the oak meadow curriculum as a resource, not a mandatory<br/>\nthing...or else it becomes school. Plus, I think Oak Meadow intended you to<br/>\nuse it as a curriculum to get the most out of it.  I find this all very<br/>\ninteresting and sometimes unsettling.  I certainly have days of uncertainty<br/>\nand think...Maybe a curriculum would have been easier!   That&#39;s the tricky<br/>\nthing about all this freedom...it means we as parents have to let go of so<br/>\nmuch to offer it up to our children in an unburdend way.
