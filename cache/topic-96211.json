There are <br/>\nactually three books in the series, The Giver, Gathering Blue and the new <br/>\none called Messenger.  We both found them interesting and very thought <br/>\nprovoking.  I was very curious about a lot of things from the first two <br/>\nthat are cleared up in the Messenger as it brings the two together.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to give it away, but Messenger would also be a bit disturbing <br/>\nfor those who found the first two like that.  We actually saw Lois Lowry at <br/>\na book store signing event where she gave a talk and unfortunately I was <br/>\nbusy with my younger child, but my daughter did hear her talk.  I had <br/>\nquestions I wanted to ask, but didn&#39;t have the chance.  I always wondered <br/>\nwhat happened to the baby (Gabriel) from the first book.  There was no <br/>\nindication of what happened to him in the third (but Jonas does live).  My <br/>\ndaughter found the books to be sad but not so disturbing.  However, she&#39;s <br/>\nnever been too bothered by really tough things in stories.  For instance, <br/>\nwhen I was reading aloud HP and Goblet of Fire I was horrified to read the <br/>\npart about Wormtail cutting off his hand, but it didn&#39;t bother her at all <br/>\nand that was several years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I would still highly recommend Lowry&#39;s books.  The one that is my <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s favorite and the one she chose to have signed by Lois Lowry is <br/>\nNumber the Stars which is about the Holocaust.  I haven&#39;t read it, but it&#39;s <br/>\non my reading list now!<br/>\nKristin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tjoylyn [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a>]<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir is a companion to the giver, called Gathering Blue.  Both are very<br/>\ndisturbing novels.  Maybe I just take them too seriously, but I was very<br/>\ndisturbed by them, and yet I have read both books more than once, and<br/>\nwould like to teach the giver to my students (6th grade).  I also don&#39;t<br/>\nwant Lexie to read it, yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96206,"nextTopicId":1847}}
