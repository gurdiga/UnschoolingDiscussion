What a beautiful and truly miraculous <br/>\nstory.  One thing I have definitely learned from my infertility, and I can <br/>\ntell you have too; is to have complete faith in God.. I n fact, I believe one <br/>\nof the reasons for my infertility was that God was calling me and this was <br/>\nthe way I would listen.  I truly believe that there is another child coming <br/>\ninto our lives.  And I also believe that even if we adopt her, she was still <br/>\nalways meant to be our child.  Your story proves what I have always believed <br/>\n- you must know that your son was definitely meant to be yours!  I will never <br/>\nforget your story and I appreciate you for sharing.   jackie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"kayelle42@aol.com","from":"kayelle42@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"0HS2siHYsilZJCx5y5dJmZavbgL9ntZeYAkivXMtXGAKrzH7b5Puze_arPKbvYN4JXz9quwrg4I","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] infertility","postDate":"954511011","msgId":7586,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY5LjMwMTkzNzMuMjYxNjA4YTNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7587,"prevInTime":7585,"nextInTime":7587,"topicId":7586,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Marcie, Thanks for your letter!
