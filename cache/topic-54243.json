I&#39;m going to file them away for next <br/>\nyear.  :)  I wish I had seen the mask idea earlier, because I made a <br/>\ngajillion masks for Will when he was 3, 4 and 5, and so I have lots of <br/>\nexperience!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a lot of business to conduct at this meeting, so I had a shorter time <br/>\nthan usual.  I really wanted them to get that everyone can have different <br/>\nideas of beauty; that &quot;beauty is in the eye of the beholder&quot;.  I took Sister <br/>\nWendy&#39;s book _My Favorite Things_ and emphasized that these were *her* <br/>\nfavorite things, and we talked about the things each of us thought were <br/>\nbeautiful.  I did want them to get they idea that beauty exists outside of <br/>\nwhat we can see as well.  We didn&#39;t spend too much time discussing it <br/>\n(because that&#39;s boring!), but I didn&#39;t have time for a craft.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe church where we meet has a labrynth for meditation painted on the parking <br/>\nlot and so we went out to walk it.  On the way, some people were working in <br/>\nthe sanctuary, taking down the Christmas backdrop, and putting up a new one.  <br/>\nFortunately, one of the members saw us and asked if we were the ones looking <br/>\nfor &quot;the beauty in Camp Fire&quot;.  (Will had written on the whiteboard outside <br/>\nour door &quot;CamP FiRE USA&quot; and I had written above it &quot;Seek Beauty in&quot;.  We try <br/>\nto put the theme of the meeting on the whiteboard every week.)  He invited us <br/>\ninto the sanctuary and showed us the old backdrop with stars and lights and <br/>\nthe kids were awed by its mass and the partially disassembled view of it.  <br/>\nThe new backdrop was of some doves on a huge canvas, and the guy explained it <br/>\nto us.  He was so forthcoming and enthusiastic about the art and what we were <br/>\ndoing.  We talked about the other art in the sanctuary and the architecture <br/>\nand the 50 yo stained glass windows that were starting to droop at the <br/>\nbottom.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen we went out and walked (and ran) the labrynth, and enjoyed the BEAUTIFUL <br/>\nblue sky and 35 degree weather.  :)  The guy told us a little about what the <br/>\nlabrynth was for (to help you meditate and pray and why it does help--he was <br/>\nso great!) and one of the kids in the group who attends the church told us <br/>\nabout how long it took to paint it.  We talked about more beautiful things <br/>\nand ideas when we got to the center of the labrynth.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have learned to trust my instincts and intuition with this group, and not <br/>\noverplan the meetings.  There&#39;s no way it could have been better if I had <br/>\norchestrated and asked the guy to come and meet us in the sanctuary!  I think <br/>\nmy unschooling ideas and experience have made me much more attuned to the <br/>\nnatural flow of learning and being together and not having &quot;standards of <br/>\nlearning&quot; and being in relationship with the kids and just having fun.  I <br/>\njust try to be relaxed and trust the children.  The kids keep wanting to come <br/>\nback, so that&#39;s a good thing, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I played my ukulele when we sang the Camp Fire Law song and they all said <br/>\nI should get a bead for that!  :)  Good day.
