I think it&#39;s anytime anyone of them tells you to approach something from a position of fear instead of a position of trust.  I have seen that naturopaths  can cause people to look at the world as a scary, fearful place and make them worried that they can&#39;t trust themselves to know what they should eat.   I think fear is one of the worst things we can do for our health.  So yes, I agree, but I also think that more mainstream doctors are full of fear.  It&#39;s just that (as a generalization) mainstream doctors are afraid of germs and can&#39;t trust the body, and naturopaths are afraid of toxins and can&#39;t trust the body.  Kind of like schools can&#39;t trust the mind to learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also found that intuitive energy medicine is more in line with what I&#39;ve learned about natural learning through unschooling.  When my homeopath talks about trusting your instincts it&#39;s just like hearing an unschooler talk.  The philosophies fit very nicely together for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hello,<br/>\n<br/>\n  As I&#39;m pondering where my food issues may stem from, I keep coming back to the Naturopath(s) I have seen as a mother, after my children were born, that seemed to scare the bejeezus out of me when it came to my children&#39;s health.  They talked about not absorbing nutrients, ruined intestinal villa, not enough &quot;good&quot; bacteria, food allergies until we were eating only rice, etc.etc. etc.  I was led to believe my kids were quite mortal......has anyone else had to detoxify from this kind of experience with naturopaths/natural health advisors? <br/>\n<br/>\n  BTW, their health didn&#39;t improve until we let go of all those incredibly restrictive inane diet beliefs and allowed all foods into our diet along with some intuitive energy medicine.<br/>\n<br/>\n  MIchele<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
