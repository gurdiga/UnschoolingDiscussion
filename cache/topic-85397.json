I love the caring you have for eachother<br/>\nthat comes through in your posts :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI just thought I would say that I notice one of my son&#39;s allergic reactions<br/>\nis a huge increase in anxiety and irrational fear.  When he was about eight,<br/>\nhe started to worry about the doors being locked at night and stuff.  This<br/>\nconfused me because he had never acted like that before, although he had<br/>\nallergies like stuffed sinuses which I could not figure out. We switched our<br/>\ndiet to exclude grains and beans and sugar (as best as we could), and those<br/>\nfears went away.  Now at 11, he knows that if he eats grains (especially<br/>\nwheat- bread), he can expect a really stuffy head AND if he eats say two or<br/>\nthree meals of &quot;bad&quot; foods--anxiety.  And he says, &quot;I am worrying about the<br/>\ndogs getting out, I think it must have been the birthday cake&quot;.  My other<br/>\nson gets kindof mean and also &quot;irrational&quot; like wanting it to be day when it<br/>\nis night (he just turned three :-) when he eats grains.  He chooses those<br/>\nfoods much more than his brother because we have alot of friends that eat<br/>\nmostly eat grains and have crackers and stuff, although he is learning about<br/>\nwhen he feels yucky, and is starting to choose say, sunflower seeds over<br/>\npirates booty (cheesy corn puffs) at the store- (although yesterday it was<br/>\npirates booty :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, maybe it is related a bit to food for your son too. I read a book<br/>\n&quot;Is this your CHild&quot;, I think there must be others- that one talks about<br/>\nemotional allergic reactions which some people dismiss, which is really<br/>\nsilly I think.  I mean we really act like our mind and body are different<br/>\nand separate- but it is sort of an illogical assumtion I believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\nBronwen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85201,"nextTopicId":85385}}
