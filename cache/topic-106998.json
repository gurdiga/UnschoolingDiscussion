I found it moving files from <br/>\none computer to another.<br/>\n<br/>\nDate:      Wednesday, October 31, 2001 7:46:24 AM<br/>\nTo:         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNewer homeschoolers/unschoolers often have a vision of schoolwork in their <br/>\nheads, and they&#39;re hoping for an alternate way to get that small set of <br/>\nknowledge (which probably seems big from their point of view, at first) into their <br/>\nkids.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOlder homechoolers realize that the &quot;set of knowledge&quot; is as much as can be <br/>\ngathered from interaction, experience and discussion in the whole world, for <br/>\nthe rest of one&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to the newer people here, since we&#39;re not talking about children and <br/>\nmath/English/science/history, we&#39;re not talking about unschooling.   But we ARE <br/>\ntalking about history.  Don&#39;t you expect people born in 1930 to be able to tell <br/>\nyou something about WWII?   Our kids will be called on by their grandkids to <br/>\ntell them what they remember about the war that began in their childhoods.   It <br/>\nwon&#39;t be, I hope, &quot;I don&#39;t remember anything except people put flags on their <br/>\ncars and my mom kept singing &#39;God Bless America.&#39;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we ARE talking English, and political science.   How is a nation informed <br/>\nand made supportive of a war?   Why will soldiers happily go to war?   Why <br/>\nwill the families back home happily accept it?   There are motivations in <br/>\nhistorical movements.    &quot;Why?&quot; will lead to why when the kids are coming across the <br/>\nhistory of Poland, of South Africa, of the Moors in medieval Spain, of the <br/>\nRoman Empire.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sooner a family cuts loose from the school model where kids learn certain <br/>\nthings and parents consider they are &quot;through with school&quot; and don&#39;t have to <br/>\nlearn, the sooner unschooling will actually work instead of just being a model <br/>\nwhich isn&#39;t quite fitting the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n(end of 10/31/02 post)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106996,"nextTopicId":106997}}
