My parents and teachers and the whole culture conspired <br/>\nto demand this of me, for years and years. The irony was that I was strong and <br/>\nfast and quite liked physical play if given an opportunity to choose, rather <br/>\nthan them dictate it to get my nose out of the books. <br/>\n<br/>\n       (Also I recall vividly how much I loved the cool, crisp <br/>\nair-conditioning and dreaded the outdoor heat/humidity of central Florida. I resented that <br/>\nthe teachers got to stay inside with the books; more than anything, I think my <br/>\ndriving desire for THAT  privilege shaped my career in education. &lt;eg&gt;)<br/>\n      <br/>\n       DH catches himself doing this now, pronouncing that the children <br/>\n&quot;need&quot; more or less of this or that, when it&#39;s really just echoes in his head of <br/>\nthe old grown-up imperative to control and standardize, and to seem to be <br/>\n&quot;doing&quot; something to, or for, or about, the children, no matter which direction (on <br/>\nvery rare occasions I&#39;ve caught myself doing this too &lt;g&gt;)  JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89534,"nextTopicId":89497}}
