It&#39;s great<br/>\nbecause you can swing *really* far! We&#39;ll put hooks on the wall so you can<br/>\nhook them up out of the way when not in use.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I bought these, as well as a set of rings and a trapeze, at IKEA.<br/>\n(www.ikea.com or www.ikea.ca or wherever you happen to live). They&#39;re called<br/>\nEKORRE. For $15 Canadian (so they&#39;re likely cheaper in the US), you get a<br/>\nlovely nice sized wooden swing with ropes, etc. Special hooks to install are<br/>\n$5, though we&#39;re using something else we had in the workshop. The wooden<br/>\ntrapeze with rope/hardware was only $9.99. They should work well in a<br/>\ndoorway as well, or outside, on the ceiling, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nA nice and very much cheaper option then the onestepahead combo, though it&#39;s<br/>\nmaybe a touch trickier to switch the swing with the trapeze or rings--we&#39;ll<br/>\nprobably hang each one in it&#39;s own spot.<br/>\n<br/>\ningrid</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100027905,"authorName":"TreeGoddess","from":"TreeGoddess &lt;treegoddess@...&gt;","profile":"odrade7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion]monkey bar in the house/ was: Cleaning room question..","postDate":"1075137660","msgId":89902,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyOUEyNjdELTUwMjQtMTFEOC05Mzg1LTAwMDM5M0E1REE2NkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwZjgwMWMzZTQyNSQ0OTMzZjJkMCRiZDAwYThjMEBvPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwZjgwMWMzZTQyNSQ0OTMzZjJkMCRiZDAwYThjMEBvPg=="},"prevInTopic":89896,"nextInTopic":89922,"prevInTime":89901,"nextInTime":89903,"topicId":89890,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Wow!
