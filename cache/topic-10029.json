It would be much simpler if we could simply refer to<br/>\nourselves as who and what we are (I for instance am Wiyot and 3 other<br/>\ntribes) instead of the name &quot;Genocide Chris&quot; tagged on us or the newer BIA<br/>\ndesignation of Native American.  We get just as much backlash from that<br/>\nfrom folks of other ethnic backgrounds who get their bloomers in a twist<br/>\nbecause they somehow think that is disparaging to them as they were born<br/>\nhere and think they have just as much right to be called &quot;native&quot;<br/>\nAmericans.  Can&#39;t win for losing &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the elders don&#39;t like the NA term because they were always Indian. <br/>\nBut, most don&#39;t refer to themselves as either but by the tribe they belong<br/>\nto.  It is more a way to communicate with the &quot;white&quot; population who<br/>\nhaven&#39;t a clue as to who or what Hupa, Hopi and Hoopa refer to or that<br/>\nthere were over 100 seperate and distinct tribes in California alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I gotta tell you, Twinki&#39;s are more likely to be offended than folks<br/>\nwho know what an Apple is, what a rez rocket is and what a 49 is.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda, who is clear as mud as usual &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hey Lynda,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is a bit of a discussion in the &quot;letters to the editor&quot; page of <br/>\n&gt; our local paper, seems a reporter used the term &quot;Indian&quot; when <br/>\n&gt; referring to a &quot;Native American&quot; and some white woman who has <br/>\n&gt; three adopted children that are &quot;Native Americans&quot;.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In your email you used the term &quot;Indian&quot; referring to your <br/>\n&gt; Grandfather, who I believe is a Native American?
