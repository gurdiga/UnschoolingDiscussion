These<br/>\nwere developed for middle schoolers by the Maneuvers with Mathematics project<br/>\nat the University of Illinois at Chicago, having found that the traditional<br/>\nmethods didn&#39;t work for so many kids.  They are carefully designed so that one<br/>\nskill truly builds on the next, and provides real-world contexts.
