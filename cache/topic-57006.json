Schooled kids often watch TV as down time from the pressures of<br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool comes at a huge emotional and time cost.

Further reading of the study usually reveals that those families are ones where the child is left with the electronic babysitter and<br/>\nrarely spoken too or read too.<br/>\nIt&#39;s also a long leap to then say TV affects actual neural development, especially since we can&#39;t really know that 100% without examining the brain itself.

Now I can relax!  Ha ha.  There seem to be many <br/>\nhomeschooling families who just don&#39;t own t.v.&#39;s, probably for a <br/>\nvariety of reasons, but maybe because they think that t.v.&#39;s are <br/>\ninherently very bad for people?  So there is that thought that goes <br/>\nthrough the homeschooling culture for sure.  I&#39;m not totally <br/>\nconvinced that t.v. is &quot;good&quot; for a person, but maybe it&#39;s not <br/>\nreally bad either, huh?  I do know that for myself, if I watch much <br/>\nt.v., it feels a little addictive and I tend to forget how much time <br/>\nhas passed, and that there were other things that I had planned to <br/>\ndo that I might have enjoyed more, had I actually gotten them <br/>\nstarted, but then it gets late and I don&#39;t feel like dragging out <br/>\nsomething to start on, and there it goes.  Sometimes it feels like a <br/>\nhuge time wasting mechanism.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there people on this list that DON&#39;T own t.v.&#39;s?  Just wondering.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a similar note, the first homeschooled family of teenaged kids <br/>\nthat I met, in Seattle, who got me onto the idea of unschooling for <br/>\nmy own kids, were just about the coolest beings I had ever met.  I <br/>\njust absolutely gravitated towards them.  They were marvelous <br/>\nbeings.  I would have enjoyed them as friends, and I had never <br/>\nthought that about 15, 16 and 17 year olds before.  Anyway, their <br/>\nparents were asked by a group forum &quot;well, what did you do, if you <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have textbooks, didn&#39;t have any curriculum or course of <br/>\nstudy?&quot;  The parents looked at each other and laughed.  The mom sort <br/>\nof sheepishly responded, &quot;well, we read aloud every day, sometimes <br/>\nfor about 2-3 hours&quot;, trying to make it seem like they had done <br/>\nsomething &quot;productive&quot;.  And the father, very proud of the fact that <br/>\nthe kids were so marvelous and hadn&#39;t done things in the &quot;usual&quot; <br/>\nmanner, said, &quot;heck, they really just played video games all day!  <br/>\nSeriously.  Like 3-4 hours of video games every day.&quot;  He was <br/>\nprobably over simplifying, but at the time I thought that was so <br/>\namazing.  Had they REALLY played video games all day?  The kids were <br/>\nall musical marvels in truth, and had played music half the day and <br/>\nvideo games the other (okay, and probably done a few other things in <br/>\nbetween).  But, I remember some people just kind of dismissing the <br/>\nwhole family at that point, saying something like, &quot;well, I was so <br/>\ndisappointed to hear that they played video games.  And did you hear <br/>\ntheir grammar?  It was horrible.  I won&#39;t want my kids playing video <br/>\ngames all day, that&#39;s for sure.&quot;  Their grammar, to me, was <br/>\nimpeccable, actually.  They used colloquialisms, because they were <br/>\nhip and were teenagers.  But they didn&#39;t make errors in grammar, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think.  For the nay sayers, though, I think it was just a way <br/>\nof dismissing something that didn&#39;t fit into one&#39;s framework -- the <br/>\nvideo game thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not really in sync with the movement, but there is an article on <br/>\nthe Taking Children Seriously site by the physicist David D (can&#39;t <br/>\nrecall spelling) about computer games, that is worth reading.  He <br/>\nbasically says that people see that kids like something, in this <br/>\ninstance computer games, and they immediately set out to prove that <br/>\nit is bad.  He thinks that they never have any real evidence, but <br/>\nthat they already determine ahead of time that the thing (whatever <br/>\nit is) that kids like is bad and they just bring a bunch of semi-<br/>\nevidence together to try to prove their point.  But that the truth <br/>\nis, the fact that the kids like it so much is what is bothering them <br/>\nin the first place.  It just doesn&#39;t sit well with them type thing.  <br/>\nGood article, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Is Unschooling A Transformation?","postDate":"1044024550","msgId":57351,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFmMS5iMTQzMTcuMmI2YmU2ZTZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":57343,"nextInTopic":57361,"prevInTime":57350,"nextInTime":57352,"topicId":57006,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/31/2003 9:19:52 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...

I&#39;ve got every book out <br/>\nthere about water babies, kids in water, everything. I read them all <br/>\nbefore my kids were born. Both of my kids were born in birth tubs, <br/>\nquite literally born into the water! I&#39;m a swimmer, have been a fish <br/>\nall my life, never miss a chance to swim. I swim in lakes all summer, <br/>\noceans, rivers, pools - whenever I can! I&#39;ve been a lifeguard, a <br/>\nswimming teacher, and a swim coach. I was pretty confident my kids <br/>\nwould love the water too, especially after reading all those <br/>\nencouraging books. And for my daughter, she loved this method, she <br/>\nwas in the pool from when she was just a few weeks old. She&#39;s always <br/>\nbeen a fish. If all my kids were like her, I&#39;d totally believe that <br/>\nthis method worked great for all kids! But my son is not like that at <br/>\nall.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my son it just didn&#39;t work. He screamed if his feet touched <br/>\nwater. He wouldn&#39;t go in water at all. It might help if people <br/>\nunderstood what SID (sensory integration dysfunction) is, I guess. <br/>\nSome SID people are very sensory avoidant, as in extremely so. <br/>\nMackenzie once screamed for an entire hour because one grain of sand <br/>\nwas on his foot (even after we got it off). On a 2 week vacation in <br/>\nHawaii, he not only wouldn&#39;t go in the water, he wouldn&#39;t walk on the <br/>\nbeach, nor would he be carried over the beach. We spent 14 days there <br/>\nwithout going to the beach as a family. He never went near the pool. <br/>\nIt can be very difficult for kids like this to deal with extreme <br/>\nsensory input, such as being immersed in water. As a baby, I knew <br/>\nsomething was wrong, it just took us several years to figure it out. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith Mackenzie, swimming lessons with an extremely patient teacher <br/>\nwere what worked best to get him into the water, get him used to it <br/>\nand comfortable there (this was at age 5, mind you). One year later, <br/>\nhe&#39;s a fish! He liked the teacher, he liked the lessons, that&#39;s just <br/>\nwhat happened to work for him. Plus, of course, we had done a ton of <br/>\nwork (dietary, occupational therapy, home exercises) to help his body <br/>\nget past his SID issues that were making every day extremely <br/>\ndifficult for him. The combination, for him, worked great. Sure, I <br/>\nwish it had been as easy as it was with his sister - just taking him <br/>\nin as a baby and gradually getting him comfortable in the water - but <br/>\nthat was not to be. <br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line was that we found something he enjoyed that helped him <br/>\nget comfortable in the water. Now he wants to join the swim team, and <br/>\nwants to do a kid&#39;s triathlon, so he&#39;s working hard on his freestyle <br/>\nstroke. We watched an Ironman video last night so that he could see <br/>\nwhat good swimmers do with their bodies under the water. He really <br/>\nlikes to be able to visualize doing something in order to do it with <br/>\nhis body (same way I learn, which is why I suggested watching the <br/>\nvideo). <br/>\n<br/>\nGetting him to swim wasn&#39;t &quot;unschooling&quot; in that I did say that he <br/>\n*needed* to learn how to swim, and I wasn&#39;t willing to wait for him <br/>\nto want to do it (which might have been never). But we did work with <br/>\nhim to find a way that worked best for him. Immersing him as a baby, <br/>\ntoddler, or young child was just not going to cut it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112038769,"authorName":"Shyrley","from":"Shyrley &lt;shyrley.williams@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Is Unschooling A Transformation?","postDate":"1043963577","msgId":57242,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFMzk5RUI5LkZGRjg5OTUyQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDMwMTMwMTY1MC5oMFVHbzJFSTAyMTU0MUBjbGVhbmVyMS5jYXJvLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":57207,"nextInTopic":57279,"prevInTime":57241,"nextInTime":57243,"topicId":57006,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Jonathan Kozol.  I forget who all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When the liberal modern methods didn&#39;t work so well because kids were forced<br/>\n&gt; to be there and I was forced to give grades, and rank kids, and keep kids<br/>\n&gt; &quot;showing progress&quot; and all that, it was discouraging.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Years passed.  I spent most of those ensuing years heavily involved in the<br/>\n&gt; Society for Creative Anachronism, where people learn some pretty far-ranging<br/>\n&gt; things for free, for fun, just because they need to know or want to know.<br/>\n&gt; And I saw many of them get to the point that they had jobs doing costumes for<br/>\n&gt; operas, or armor for museums, or calligraphy for government projects and<br/>\n&gt; movies.  And lots more did it just for the joy of it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When I had Kirby I joined La Leche League, and through that a babysitting<br/>\n&gt; co-op that devolved into just a playgroup after a few years.   There were<br/>\n&gt; four homeschooling families in that co-op.  I didn&#39;t intend to homeschool,<br/>\n&gt; but I and my kids knew these families in their homes, and knew their kids in<br/>\n&gt; our homes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What a lucky lab situation for me!!  Two families were structured and two<br/>\n&gt; were unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The main differences were the unschooled kids were nicer and more honest.<br/>\n&gt; The unschooling families had warmer relationships with their kids.  Kids<br/>\n&gt; would come up and sit with their moms and dads instead of avoiding them in<br/>\n&gt; situations like barbecues or parties.  Those kids would have conversations<br/>\n&gt; with me like I was just another kid, just another person.  The<br/>\n&gt; structured-family kids were like kids who went to school.  I saw no<br/>\n&gt; differences in the patterns or the relationships between the parents and<br/>\n&gt; kids, even though these moms were as involved in La Leche League as others in<br/>\n&gt; the group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then Kirby came to seem like a kid who should stay home.  I didn&#39;t consider<br/>\n&gt; buying a curriculum.  I re-read all applicable books then in my possession<br/>\n&gt; (Whole Child, Whole Parent; some Holt; Chop Wood, Carry Water), I subscribed<br/>\n&gt; to Growing Without Schooling, and read each issue cover to cover, publication<br/>\n&gt; declarations, ads and personals and all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I figured if it wasn&#39;t working I could switch to something else, but of<br/>\n&gt; course it did work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So my transformation happened gradually and in the absence of kids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There were three kids in there years before Kirby, who were 3, 10 and 12<br/>\n&gt; (plus three years for each) who were in the custody of my first husband and<br/>\n&gt; me.  His youngest sister and brother, and my half brother.  I learned a lot<br/>\n&gt; of what didn&#39;t work, what might work, and what I could do better in the<br/>\n&gt; future.

I&#39;m pretty adamant <br/>\nthat my kids know how to swim. We&#39;re around water all the time, and I <br/>\nthink it&#39;s an important thing to know. I&#39;ve told them that either I <br/>\nwill teach them or they can take lessons. My son just opted to drop <br/>\nlessons and have me continue teaching him. As soon as they&#39;re <br/>\nproficient swimmers, we&#39;ll stop. But I wasn&#39;t willing to wait until <br/>\nwhatever age they thought it would be good to learn to swim. I guess <br/>\nbecause I&#39;ve pulled a 7 year old boy from a river where he would&#39;ve <br/>\ndrowned, I&#39;ve got strong feelings on this one. Everything else I&#39;m <br/>\nwilling to be patient with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have met only a few unschoolers and watched and talked to them <br/>\n </span></blockquote>about how <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; they unschool.

Number one is that I don&#39;t think <br/>\nunschooling and non-coercive parenting  (NCP) are the same thing. As <br/>\nthe mom of a food-allergic kid, I have no problem &quot;coercing&quot; my child <br/>\nand not allowing him to eat something he&#39;s allergic to. Especially <br/>\nbefore we had him treated and his allergies were of the life-<br/>\nthreatening variety. I also wouldn&#39;t allow him to step out in front <br/>\nof a speeding truck, which is more or less the equivalent for an <br/>\nallergic kid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Another situation is when it was time to <br/>\n&gt; leave, we had to be out of the rented space at 2:30pm, the child <br/>\n </span></blockquote>wanted to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; stay longer.  The mother ended up having to pick him up and take <br/>\n </span></blockquote>him out <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; because reasoning with him wasn&#39;t working.  Would most of you do <br/>\n </span></blockquote>things <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; differently in situations similar to this? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, with the allergy thing, we&#39;ve done a lot of discussions to help <br/>\nthe kids understand what living with a food allergy means so that <br/>\nthey can take control of it themselves, but when they were younger we <br/>\ndid a lot of &quot;coercing&quot; for lack of a better word. And still, if <br/>\nthere&#39;s an unknown food, I have to read the ingredients and make the <br/>\ndecision, because neither of them is at the point they can do that <br/>\nyet. If that&#39;s coercive, so be it. I don&#39;t see unschooling as <br/>\nallowing my kids to die or live in terrible health.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as leaving someplace, I always try to set up the situation so <br/>\nthat we don&#39;t get into a power struggle about leaving. I don&#39;t think <br/>\nI&#39;ve had to pick my kids up since they were small toddlers. But <br/>\nneither would it be negotiable if it is a rented space. If I knew <br/>\nthat transitioning away from the activity was likely to be a big <br/>\nproblem, I&#39;d probably try to set up the situation so that we had <br/>\nsomething interesting to do next, even just a special Lego project at <br/>\nhome to do. But that doesn&#39;t always work. If it came down to it, yeah <br/>\nI&#39;d pick my kid up and carry them out. At some point, I feel you have <br/>\nto balance courtesy for others (like the group who might want to <br/>\ncontinue renting that space, or the next group who had the space <br/>\nrented) with your child&#39;s immediate comfort level. A lot of it is age <br/>\ndependent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve tried to figure out how to do things so my children get to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>make <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; decisions on their own, but often times their decision doesn&#39;t just <br/>\n </span></blockquote>affect <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; me and my family, but it affects others.   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a balancing act, for sure!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3.

Everyone was patiently waiting and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>encouraging him to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; get ready.  It isn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t want to go, but because of his <br/>\n </span></blockquote>age, he <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; has no sense of time, or no concern for others feelings.  My father-<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in-law <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; needed to eat soon because he&#39;s on a schedule like I am when it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>comes to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; eating. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, first of all, I&#39;d say that if your FIL needs to eat, that&#39;s <br/>\nsomething he needs to take responsibility for. I also need to eat <br/>\nfrequently, and I&#39;m never without a small bag of nuts, a fruit <br/>\nleather, some carrot sticks, etc. in my purse. That way I&#39;m not <br/>\ndependent on anyone else&#39;s whims for getting my own needs taken care <br/>\nof. <br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, I&#39;d take a look at whether going out to a restaurant is a <br/>\ngood idea if you&#39;ve got a child that is going to make it difficult. <br/>\nThere were several years where we just didn&#39;t do restaurants because <br/>\nthe kids really weren&#39;t capable of sitting still, being quiet enough, <br/>\netc. and it would&#39;ve been a miserable situation. If you have to drag <br/>\na kid kicking and screaming to a restaurant, what&#39;s the point of <br/>\nspending the money to have a nice meal, KWIM? So we try to set up <br/>\nsituations where everyone wins. If we wanted to have a nice meal at a <br/>\nrestaurant, we waited until my mom was visiting and could hang out <br/>\nwith the kids. <br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to evade the question - there *are* times when a kid <br/>\nhas to do something they simply don&#39;t want to do. It might be <br/>\naccompanying a parent to a doctor&#39;s appointment that they couldn&#39;t <br/>\nschedule for any other time, and they couldn&#39;t find someone to be <br/>\nwith the kids. At those times, I just try my best to make it pleasant <br/>\nfor the kids. Bring along a special book or toy, etc.<br/>\nIf getting ready to go is a problem, get them ready before they start <br/>\nplaying. I&#39;ve found it&#39;s easier to ask my kids to get dressed, hair <br/>\ncombed, teeth brushed right when we get out of bed, for instance. If <br/>\nI wait until they&#39;re deep in play and we need to get somewhere, it&#39;s <br/>\nmuch more difficult and we end up being late. If need be, I&#39;ll put <br/>\ntheir shoes in the car, and they can put them on when they get there. <br/>\nWith my kids at an age where time relevance and distractibility are <br/>\nbig issues, I just do my best to make it easy for them. Doesn&#39;t <br/>\nalways work though.<br/>\nI find that when I am able to think creatively, find way to do things <br/>\nI want to do that also keeps the kids happy, bring along distractions <br/>\nfor things they don&#39;t want to do, and try and help them as much as <br/>\npossible with getting ready to go places, usually we have a fairly <br/>\neasy time of it. <br/>\nI also think it helps if you&#39;re usually easy-going. My kids know that <br/>\nmost of the time, I&#39;m willing to roll with their schedule. A two hour <br/>\nplaydate can often turn into a five hour playdate, and I&#39;m willing to <br/>\njust hang around at a park or pool or beach just so they can have <br/>\nmore time with their friends. It helps that their friend&#39;s moms are <br/>\nusually my good friends, so it&#39;s a bonus for all of us. :-) But given <br/>\nall of that, when I do need to go someplace and we do have to leave, <br/>\nthey&#39;re usually pretty understanding because I don&#39;t arbitrarily <br/>\nforce them to do that all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the same thing goes for the swimming lessons. I explained to <br/>\nthem that, while I&#39;m perfectly willing to let them follow their <br/>\nagenda on everything else, there&#39;s this one thing that I want them to <br/>\nlearn now, for their own safety. Neither of them has complained about <br/>\nit or balked at it. I think they trust that if I feel it&#39;s important <br/>\nenough to have them learn it now, then it is important. If I forced <br/>\nthem to learn other, more arbitrary things all the time, they <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have that trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"genant2@aol.com","from":"genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Is Unschooling A Transformation?","postDate":"1043939270","msgId":57149,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYzLjI3YWM3MjlkLjJiNmE5OWM2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":57135,"nextInTopic":57153,"prevInTime":57148,"nextInTime":57150,"topicId":57006,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"1.

It talked about how we (dh and I) had talked about <br/>\nspanking and discipline before the boys were born and had decided to not use <br/>\npunishment.  And it talked about how when my first son was a baby he demanded <br/>\na lot of closeness with us.

They would decide when, where, what and how <br/>\nmuch to eat.  etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n My dh didn&#39;t know about the letter and when I showed him he assumed I had <br/>\njust written it.  When I told him I had written it years ago he was so <br/>\npleased with how everything had gone and is going now.  How our thinking <br/>\nthen, even though we were nervous about our decisions, had been so right.  At <br/>\nthat time we didn&#39;t have the Internet and were in the military and had no <br/>\nsupport system but each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll these gut instincts totally went against everything we were taught were <br/>\nproper parenting techniques.  But everything we did then put us in a place to <br/>\nbe so receptive to the unschooling concept when we discovered it.  So our <br/>\nboys have never been made to do anything they didn&#39;t want to and when my <br/>\noldest became old enough and everyone was asking us about preschool we <br/>\ngravitated toward letting him make the decisions then as well.  It all seemed <br/>\nto flow so nicely for us.  No major revelations, no deschooling, no belief <br/>\nchanges etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Was Transformation?/ joy in jobs","postDate":"1043932356","msgId":57135,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMTMwMTMxMjM2LjM1NjIyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTEyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE5Ni4xNGRjMDVhZi4yYjZhMDYyNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57132,"nextInTopic":57149,"prevInTime":57134,"nextInTime":57136,"topicId":57006,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Jonathan Kozol.  I forget who all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the liberal modern methods didn&#39;t work so well because kids were forced <br/>\nto be there and I was forced to give grades, and rank kids, and keep kids <br/>\n&quot;showing progress&quot; and all that, it was discouraging.<br/>\n<br/>\nYears passed.  I spent most of those ensuing years heavily involved in the <br/>\nSociety for Creative Anachronism, where people learn some pretty far-ranging <br/>\nthings for free, for fun, just because they need to know or want to know.  <br/>\nAnd I saw many of them get to the point that they had jobs doing costumes for <br/>\noperas, or armor for museums, or calligraphy for government projects and <br/>\nmovies.  And lots more did it just for the joy of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I had Kirby I joined La Leche League, and through that a babysitting <br/>\nco-op that devolved into just a playgroup after a few years.   There were <br/>\nfour homeschooling families in that co-op.  I didn&#39;t intend to homeschool, <br/>\nbut I and my kids knew these families in their homes, and knew their kids in <br/>\nour homes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a lucky lab situation for me!!  Two families were structured and two <br/>\nwere unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main differences were the unschooled kids were nicer and more honest.  <br/>\nThe unschooling families had warmer relationships with their kids.  Kids <br/>\nwould come up and sit with their moms and dads instead of avoiding them in <br/>\nsituations like barbecues or parties.  Those kids would have conversations <br/>\nwith me like I was just another kid, just another person.  The <br/>\nstructured-family kids were like kids who went to school.  I saw no <br/>\ndifferences in the patterns or the relationships between the parents and <br/>\nkids, even though these moms were as involved in La Leche League as others in <br/>\nthe group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen Kirby came to seem like a kid who should stay home.  I didn&#39;t consider <br/>\nbuying a curriculum.  I re-read all applicable books then in my possession <br/>\n(Whole Child, Whole Parent; some Holt; Chop Wood, Carry Water), I subscribed <br/>\nto Growing Without Schooling, and read each issue cover to cover, publication <br/>\ndeclarations, ads and personals and all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI figured if it wasn&#39;t working I could switch to something else, but of <br/>\ncourse it did work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my transformation happened gradually and in the absence of kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were three kids in there years before Kirby, who were 3, 10 and 12 <br/>\n(plus three years for each) who were in the custody of my first husband and <br/>\nme.  His youngest sister and brother, and my half brother.  I learned a lot <br/>\nof what didn&#39;t work, what might work, and what I could do better in the <br/>\nfuture.

I say we took a sharp LEFT turn when we found unschooling. <br/>\nIt&#39;s a process. We feel that we&#39;ve &quot;arrived&quot; though! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been said here several times, but there IS a paradigm shift. Almost <br/>\neverything has to change to &quot;get it&quot;. We&#39;ve all been brainwashed for YEARS. <br/>\nThat&#39;s a lot of &quot;dirt&quot; to get back into our heads!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2. Are there certain situations, where unschooling just doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; work, or do most unschoolers unschool 100% of the time? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s 99.7 %. With real unschoolers. We may have lapses. We&#39;re not <br/>\nquite perfect! &lt;G&gt; I&#39;m not pleasant when I&#39;m over-hungry, but my sweet boys <br/>\nwill remind me to eat if I get crabby. Or bring me food. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I have met only a few unschoolers and watched and talked to them about how <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; they unschool.  They all in conversations seem to be saying what most of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the posters on this board say, but when I watch them interact with their <br/>\n&gt; &gt; children, I can see where they make decisions for their children, and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; coerce them into doing something they want.  An example of this is at a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; potluck one of the children wanted to eat something he&#39;s allergic to, but <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; his mom wouldn&#39;t let him do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, thank you for specifics. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s a true allergy, she was possibly saving his life! <br/>\nThis ISN&#39;T NCP/TCS where you let the child do &quot;whatever&quot; to his obvious <br/>\ndetriment or that of another. It would matter more WHY and HOW she <br/>\nacted/reacted. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Another situation is when it was time to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; leave, we had to be out of the rented space at 2:30pm, the child wanted to <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; stay longer.  The mother ended up having to pick him up and take him out <br/>\n&gt; &gt; because reasoning with him wasn&#39;t working.  Would most of you do things <br/>\n&gt; &gt; differently in situations similar to this?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Probably. I would have made somewhere else seem like a MUCH better place. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to realize: we hear people come here every week who say that they <br/>\nunschool except for math. They unschool with educational things. But they <br/>\nrequire chores and they ground for such-and-such offense and they don&#39;t allow <br/>\ncertain language in the houses.<br/>\n<br/>\nMANY who profess to be unschoolers....AREN&#39;T. Or maybe they&#39;re wannabees who <br/>\nhaven&#39;t yet &quot;arrived&quot;. Or maybe they&#39;re hungry! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3. How do you handle situations where a small child wants to do <br/>\n&gt; something, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; but what he wants to do affects everyone, not just the child and the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; family?   <br/>\n&gt; &gt; An example of this is when my son was playing around and wouldn&#39;t get <br/>\n&gt; ready <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to go out to dinner.  Everyone was patiently waiting and encouraging him <br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; get ready.  It isn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t want to go, but because of his age, <br/>\n&gt; he <br/>\n&gt; &gt; has no sense of time, or no concern for others feelings.  My <br/>\n&gt; father-in-law <br/>\n&gt; &gt; needed to eat soon because he&#39;s on a schedule like I am when it comes to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; eating. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce has the best explanation of this: children don&#39;t WANT to be bad. They <br/>\nWANT to please. They don&#39;t always know HOW. It&#39;s our job to help them gently.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce? Joyce?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were to speak with him as you would with ANY other person: &quot;We REALLY <br/>\nneed to go now. Opa MUST have some food---you know, or he&#39;ll get sick and <br/>\ncrabby like ME! Let&#39;s get a move on! Here, I have your shoes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132256168,"authorName":"HappyMato2@aol.com","from":"HappyMato2@...","profile":"home_ed4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Is Unschooling A Transformation?","postDate":"1043866056","msgId":57006,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1ZS4xYWYwOWIxNS4yYjY5N2JjOEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":57087,"prevInTime":57005,"nextInTime":57007,"topicId":57006,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/27/03 8:23:09 AM Pacific Standard Time, ...
