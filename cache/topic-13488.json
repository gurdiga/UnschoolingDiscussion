The district will rate parents on<br/>\nhow well they fulfil 23 &quot;responsibilities.&quot; Schools have the option of<br/>\ntargeting all parents, or only selected parents. Parents who don&#39;t meet the<br/>\nexpectations of the schools will receive home visits every 10 weeks from<br/>\none of more than 1000 school staff members or counselors.
