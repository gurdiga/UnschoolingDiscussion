There are many police officers who _DO_<br/>\ngo too far!  That is NOT fine.  We, as citizens, should help enforce<br/>\nthat when a cop hurts a person that the cop is accountable for their<br/>\nactions.  Of course, they should be able to defend themselves when<br/>\nneeded.  We ALL should, and I&#39;ve taken lots of training to ensure that<br/>\n*I* could if I needed to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have physically restrained my children.  I don&#39;t like it.  However,<br/>\nwhen we are in a crowded parking lot with cars going way too fast<br/>\neverywhere and my little child wants to run around, I pick them up and<br/>\nhold them.  I don&#39;t do this harshly or in a mean manner and I usually<br/>\nsay something along the lines of, &quot;There are cars everywhere and you are<br/>\ntoo little for them to see you, I need to hold you.&quot;  Sometimes that has<br/>\nbeen fine, sometimes they&#39;ve screamed, &quot;No!&quot;  Either way, I remain calm<br/>\nand talk (sometimes whisper) to them about how this situation is no fun,<br/>\nso let&#39;s hurry and get out of it.  And, the biggest solution for not<br/>\never doing this type of physical restraint ever is to avoid these<br/>\nsituations with toddlers that don&#39;t quite get it yet.  :)  I do a lot of<br/>\ninternet shopping.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust now, my 2.5 yo showed me another way in which I have been and will<br/>\ncontinue to be physical with her:  She was yanking on her older sister&#39;s<br/>\nneck hurting her and not realizing it, but nevertheless trapping here<br/>\nsister and causing pain.  I swooped in, picked her up, exclaimed that we<br/>\ndon&#39;t hurt Zoe, then took her to sit with me instead (she is now<br/>\nbreastfeeding while I type one handed).  That was very much an authority<br/>\ncoming in and doing a physical action.  This is fine, actually good.  If<br/>\nI hadn&#39;t stepped in, she would have learned that she could hurt her<br/>\nsister and her sister would have learned that I wouldn&#39;t be there to<br/>\nstop it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHIS IS NOT ON THE SAME LEVEL AS SPANKING!

Why is it okay for adults in authority over <br/>\nother adults? But not for adults in authority over kids? I don&#39;t like <br/>\nspanking. I don&#39;t even like it as a last resort. My dh feels differently. <br/>\nWhen he threatens the kids with spanking, I get on him.  He loves and <br/>\nrespects his mother more than anyone on earth, and she spanked him <br/>\noccasionally, for serious offenses. I still say parent from love, not from <br/>\nfear. Spanking instills fear. Any insight? <br/>\n<br/>\nAng<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64339,"nextTopicId":64223}}
