Super! <br/>\nLet me stand right here and watch and you know what, let me put <br/>\nthese pillows on the floor first&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning about the consequences of too many M&Ms is an <br/>\nexcellent way for a child to learn self-restraint, IMHO, and would <br/>\nfor me be well worth the consequences of a bit of clean up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, of course, the two year old cannot do what she <br/>\nwants. Sometimes, I cannot do what I want. This is where real, <br/>\ntrue, factual &quot;no&#39;s&quot; come up for all of us, as I said before.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Saying No","postDate":"1031258004","msgId":42978,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYzOW1jSzhyNmJlVXptUmY2Q2kwMDAwMTkwYkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":42964,"nextInTopic":42984,"prevInTime":42977,"nextInTime":42979,"topicId":42964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
