There is so much we can learn , by taking the opinions of subjects, from so many different sources.  It is much like a pattern , we weave, only in conversation...I think we got stuck, a couple stitches....well that just makes it unique......Let us be greatful, and try harder to listen, and respect each other....the only true way to look at anything is with your open~heart....no matter what your mind believes.....so let us share this skill.  I have a project, that I am working on in It&#39;s book of Seasons, and one chapter is  associations with feeling....how the weather affects peple&#39;s feelings...so if anyone has the time..I&#39;d appreciate it greatly if you&#39;d set for a spell, and pay close attention to the weather, describe that to me..., and then tell if their are any associations with your feelings....One other question.....On Reading....ANyone with kids  who are learning to read?????I wonder if there might be some additional, cost effective activities, to progress in this are.  My son, expresses the intentions....and reading , slowly , and sounding out words....is great ...what more can I do????Any suggestions???Many Blessings...Michelle~*</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6484,"nextTopicId":6433}}
