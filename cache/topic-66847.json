I told her I am so <br/>\nglad she asked. That sometimes I feel like I am talking about this so much <br/>\nthat I scare her away.<br/>\nI explained that what we do may or may not be where she starts but to really <br/>\nthink about what her goals are and where her expectations are.<br/>\nShe told me a story about how they got their 11 yr. old son up at 5:30 in the <br/>\nam to finish a project that he had 3 months to do. They nagged him and <br/>\nbrought him to tears. I asked what her concern about the project was and she <br/>\nsaid she was worried about grades and how he would look if he didn&#39;t finish <br/>\nit. But realized after how much pressure and stress they put on him and how <br/>\nmuch all that was affecting their family. &lt;sign&gt; I told her I think it is <br/>\nabsolutely unnecessary to spend three months on Thomas Edison (sp?) and that <br/>\nbecause her son wanted no part of doing this report that he was never going <br/>\nto remember any thing of what he learned later in life but just that stupid <br/>\nreport that I got yelled at over.  <br/>\nTwo years of hinting here and there I think she is finally seeing the light. <br/>\nI am so happy for her I could run over there and hug her! I think I will.....<br/>\nI know this is just the beginning of her journey and there will be a lot of <br/>\nbumps but I am so thrilled she is finally seeing that there is another way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 4/30/2003 2:06:30 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LOWRIEK@...\">LOWRIEK@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;The best way in the world to unschool, that I have seen, is to live your <br/>\n&gt; &gt;life <br/>\n&gt; &gt;beside your children and to support them in living their own<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kathryn, that was a great post, and I forwarded that to some friends that <br/>\n&gt; are <br/>\n&gt; questioning unschooling possibilities.
