Maybe they&#39;ll try something new.  <br/>\nMaybe they won&#39;t.  Maybe, if you don&#39;t make it such a to-do, they will have <br/>\nfond memories of mealtimes in your home and think of food as comforting and <br/>\nnourishing and will naturally want to try new things on their own.  Maybe, <br/>\nif food is attached to so many rules and pressure, they will learn to like <br/>\nnew things at the expense of finding mealtimes draining and only a necessary <br/>\naside.  Maybe they&#39;ll want to go to their friends houses for meals instead <br/>\nof wanting their friends over at yours. &lt;beg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 helps eliminate e-mail viruses.
