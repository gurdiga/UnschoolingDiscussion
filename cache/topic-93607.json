They stand there looking  at these kids like they are from outer space!  They usually just ignore it and walk away.<br/>\nThe quizzing doesn&#39;t seem to bother them either.  They just say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;.  It makes me furious, but since it doesn&#39;t matter at all to them I just let it go.<br/>\nAnn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Cornerstone Community Farm <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> ; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mamaperk@...\">Mamaperk@...</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, May 06, 2004 12:01 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] teasing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  On Thursday 06 May 2004 08:33 am, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mamaperk@...\">Mamaperk@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; What&#39;s 2 X 2?&quot;  and<br/>\n  &gt; then if/when my girls answer, the quizzing continues, gettin<br/>\n  Teach them to ignore rude people.<br/>\n  Ignoring them will diffuse the situation.<br/>\n  Besides tell your children that for every question they do not know, <br/>\n  they are many others their &quot;friends&quot; will not be able to answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Yahoo!
