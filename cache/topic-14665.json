You&#39;ll find it so much more fun than cleaning!<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, here comes the practical stuff. Ask yourself seriously how much you want <br/>\nyour house to look as if no children live there. You will recognise straight <br/>\naway that this is impossible and impractical. Ok, that&#39;s the first step. Then <br/>\ndecide, with your children and any other interested parties, how you want the <br/>\nhouse to be. Do children want run of the house? Do parents want a sanctuary <br/>\nfrom the mess of living (be warned, if you go for this option, the first time <br/>\nyou leave it messy, one of your children will notice and keep telling you <br/>\nabout it!) Once you have decided how you all want your house, change it to <br/>\nsuit. If money is tight and you&#39;ve all decided you should all be able to <br/>\npaint in the carpeted room, stick plastic bags together to make a washable <br/>\nrug. If your bedroom is no go, respect that your children may choose the same <br/>\noption etc. etc. Be creative in your thoughts and you will find you can all <br/>\nbe happy.

Of course they<br/>\ndo the latter with their scientist father, but usually, they can be left at<br/>\nthe sink concocting stuff. It is great that you are taking her need to<br/>\nexplore seriously.

She is really wanting to explore<br/>\nmore of her environment/ the home. I find I am<br/>\nfrustrated with the mess, we also don&#39;t have a large<br/>\nenough kitchen to keep the messy art, science, cooking<br/>\nplay in...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo some examples of things I find she does:<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday she found the food coloring, open it up and<br/>\nwas mixing it with water. She likes to do a lot of<br/>\nwater experimenting but I&#39;ll find her doing it in the<br/>\ncarpeted living room...sigh<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I see is a kid who is interested in exploring a<br/>\nvariety materials. So I am wondering how others have<br/>\nhelped this exploration yet remained sane as the<br/>\nparent? <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nSamantha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
