I think <br/>\nwhat finally tipped the cup for him was that he&#39;s spent a lot of the <br/>\nsummer trading and playing Pokemon cards with his friends. Most of <br/>\nhis older friends would read the cards to him, but sometimes he plays <br/>\nwith younger kids who can&#39;t. So he started figuring the stuff out on <br/>\nhis own. He has been gradually building reading skills over the last <br/>\nfew years, but it has just started to really come together for him. <br/>\nHe read me a 35 page book the other day, and I only had to help him <br/>\nwith a couple of words.
