Somehow, even tho I swear I have said things similar before, <br/>\nhe just &quot;got it&quot; more this time.  I read your post to him while he <br/>\nwas taking a bath, so we got to talk about alot of the points you <br/>\nmade. (I didn&#39;t just email it to him at work.) I did read other&#39;s <br/>\nposts too, but your seemed to jump out him. He&#39;s not &quot;there&quot; yet, but <br/>\nmuch more willing to give it a shot.  Oh, I could just kiss you, <br/>\nJoyce!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nRachel</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89779,"nextTopicId":89810}}
