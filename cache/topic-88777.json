I&#39;m self taught...started in High School by checking books out of the library, drawing the herbs and writing down the information. I tried growing herbs in my window (imagine a daylight basement, under a deck in the middle of winter and you&#39;ll know just how well they grew) which was a miserable failure, but enjoyable while they lasted. Poor plants.<br/>\nI&#39;ve always adored the smell of fresh herbs from the garden, cooking and healing with them. Once you have a basic understanding of how they work and your most common herbs/homeopathics, it&#39;s just a matter of referencing information when something comes up.<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t possibly remember the remedy for every ailment, but I keep books that help and the internet has some great sources too.<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen amazing healing take place with the use of herbs and homeopathy...so that&#39;s pretty much all we use.<br/>\nOut of four children, only one has been to the Doctor for ear infections and such when he was little (and he wasn&#39;t breastfed long enough and he received vax), the rest have had exactly two Doctor visits for being ill, between the three of them. My almost 3y.o. has never, ever been medicated and my 6 and 10y.o. have had antibiotics ONCE in their entire lives (and that was too much, had I known more at the time I could have avoided it).<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t trust a system in which pharmaceuticals have so much to gain from people being ill. There is a time and place for modern medicine, it just should not be the first line of defense...especially where children are concerned. There is long term damage to the liver and kidneys from most medications and the anti-depressants and ADD/ADHD type meds actually stimulate the same center of the brain as cocaine. Not a good idea for a developing brain. I can see why an adult would choose it in some cases, but I would do most anything to avoid that for my child unless it were absolutely necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.&quot;<br/>\nAlbert Einstein</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.
