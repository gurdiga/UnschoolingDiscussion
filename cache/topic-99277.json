:)<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;m 25 years old, live in NW illinois in a cute little house that we&#39;re<br/>\nrented after spending the entire summer out of work and living in a tent<br/>\n(albeit a large one) on our friends land playing *community* with my<br/>\nhusband of nearly 7 years and our three nutty lovely wee ones (eve-6 1/2,<br/>\nsebastian-4, lila moon-2.)  we&#39;ve never sent any of our kids to school<br/>\nand we have no intention of ever doing so and are currently suffering a<br/>\nlot of heat about this decision now that my kids are no longer safe under<br/>\nthe radar (read: my oldest *should* be in 1st grade this year.)  i found<br/>\nthis discussion group from a newsletter of a homeschooling group that we<br/>\nbelong to that seems to have some unschoolers with older kids that i<br/>\nhaven&#39;t really associated with much due to that roadblock.  i&#39;m looking<br/>\nfor a neighborhood (a virtual one, if need be!) of folks living similarly<br/>\nto myself and my family to bounce my thoughts off of and hopefully even<br/>\nhelp others out when they&#39;re looking for the same.  <br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;m interested in gardening, birth, music, sewing, felting, spinning,<br/>\nknitting, crocheting, pottery, cooking, snuggling, loving, talking,<br/>\neating delicious foods (like chocolate), rolling around in mud, building<br/>\nthings, and destroying the infernal grumpy-monster among other things. :)<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;m not interested in grouchy people who bring out the grimace i&#39;ve been<br/>\nworking so hard to make go away or particularly smelly things...oh, and i<br/>\nhate stepping on crumbs in my barefeet!<br/>\n<br/>\none more idea for dealing with messes and people who don&#39;t want to clean<br/>\nthem up...downsize!  i know this isn&#39;t practical or even desirable for<br/>\nmost people, but it really feels good here at our house.  i am much more<br/>\nefficient about my use of space and organization is no longer a problem. <br/>\ni have whittled down to what isn&#39;t a waste of space to me and have made a<br/>\nhome for each and every thing.  this includes the clothes and shoes and<br/>\ndishes.  when it comes time to sweep the floors or wash the dishes or<br/>\nclean the clothes, even if they&#39;re all dirty, it takes so much less time<br/>\nand i&#39;m cheerful just thinking about that!  we&#39;ve had such<br/>\ndisorganization and resentment and laziness in our past that this is<br/>\nclearly better.  not perfect, but i don&#39;t expect it to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;ve enjoyed the simple, yet effective suggestion of living each moment<br/>\nand choosing joy.  i&#39;m working hard on incorporating this concept into my<br/>\nlife and i even tried smiling really big in the mirror today.  i laughed,<br/>\nand it felt good. :)  also, the squashing of arbitrary *no&#39;s* has forced<br/>\nme to be conscious of just how much i&#39;m operating on autopilot sometimes,<br/>\nlistening to the whispering ghosts of my parents&#39; rules and expectations<br/>\nand relaying them into *rules* that my own children must abide by.  now<br/>\nmy kids are up to watching more tv than i&#39;d approve of (but i&#39;m shutting<br/>\nup about it and becoming amazed at the wonderful things my kids are<br/>\npicking up from seemingly dreadful child programming) and my daughter ate<br/>\nan entire bowl of flan for breakfast (which i secretly freaked out about<br/>\nthinking she was going to perish from malnutrition- INSIDE, mind you!-<br/>\nuntil she suggested we have a picnic in the yard for lunch with raw<br/>\nbroccoli and pbj tortillas decorated with apples raisins and chocolate<br/>\nchips!  and the other kids loved it too!)  i&#39;m becoming more and more<br/>\ndelighted with every moment that passes and i can&#39;t thank you all enough<br/>\nfor your wonderful discussions.  i can only hope that i can contribute<br/>\nback and lift you all up sometimes in kind!<br/>\n<br/>\nok...so i&#39;m overly chatty and terrible at organizing my thoughts any<br/>\nfurther than the free flow that pours out of my head.  will this suffice<br/>\nas an intro?
