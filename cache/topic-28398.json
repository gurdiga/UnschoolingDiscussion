I already shine the sink and the<br/>\ncounters near the sink are clear of stuff and nice and clean.  What I<br/>\nneed to do is sit down and write down where my hot spots are and go from<br/>\nthere.  I&#39;ve  got lots of those &quot;hot spots&quot;!  I am truly overwhelmed.  I<br/>\nshould probably make it a &quot;54 Fling Boogie&quot; instead of a &quot;27 Fling<br/>\nBoogie&quot;!  I am a Fly Baby in the making.  I&#39;m not giving up.  If anyone<br/>\ncan help me, it&#39;s FLY Lady.  I think she&#39;s wonderful and her philosophy<br/>\nof setting the example, I believe, goes very well with out unschooling<br/>\nlifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph Fuerst wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Mimi:<br/>\n&gt; I f you do nothing else before the New Year......take the big step and<br/>\n&gt; SHINE<br/>\n&gt; that SINK!!
