It makes a great sport for<br/>\nunschoolers too, because you don&#39;t need a team and you can travel! It<br/>\nteaches self-reliance and good decision making, builds trust and<br/>\nrelationships within the family, and I could go on...<br/>\n<br/>\nBuilding the climber and the climbing wall was a great unschooling project,<br/>\ntoo--from the design and research stages, to engineering, building and<br/>\nplaying! We&#39;ve also started a homeschooling 4-H Rock Hounds club, which is<br/>\nturning out to be quite popular. I have about 30 kids at my house every<br/>\nother week (except for field trips to real rock and other cool places).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s tons of info on home climbing gyms online. You can also check out<br/>\nour climbing log, which has pictures of the kids climbing and a link to our<br/>\nhome climbing wall about midway down, I think.
