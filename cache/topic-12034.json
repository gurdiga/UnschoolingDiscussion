One of my favorite things to do when I was a child is get school supplies, my son couldn&#39;t care less.  I liked what Erin said about constant diligence and taking advantage of learning opportunities.   We never are lacking on what to explore and he seems to be picking up all the basics at the same time.  Of course many of his ideas don&#39;t quite work, like making a skateboard into a hoverboard or turning our car into a jet, but this is a learning experience.  For my own sanitity,  I am &quot;scheduling&quot; and outing a day.  My son and I are taking about places to go: airport, park, grocery store, museum, zoo, lake, nature center.  Some of the outings will be with another homeschooling  Mom.  My son will miss the constant stream of children to play with in the neighborhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are 20 messages in this issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Topics in this digest:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       1.

I read an article about families<br/>\n&gt; using homeopathy to tackle autism, focussing on figuring out what<br/>\n&gt; the trigger had been.  Though there is a big developmental step<br/>\n&gt; around 3-4yo, your instinct that something&#39;s more seriously amiss<br/>\n&gt; could be correct.

She can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;draw a line from the &quot;A&quot; to the &quot;B&quot; or put a circle on the &quot;B&quot; or tell me<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt; &gt;there are two balls or three.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;She can&#39;t really make a sentence yet.  We can&#39;t particularly communicate<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with her because she doesn&#39;t understand much of what we say unless we use<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the very few words in her vocabulary.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;When she talks, we often can figure out what she wants but just as often,<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt;can&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;She spends a lot of her time throwing fits of frustration and being<br/>\n&gt; stubborn<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about everything and anything.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;She was raised as a baby very lovingly by both me and my husband.  She was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;very pampered and never left to cry.  We just loved her to death.  But she<br/>\n&gt; &gt;started acting this way at about 3 years old and I wonder if she isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;autistic to some degree.  I have heard that this usually occurs at about 3<br/>\n&gt; &gt;years.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Since that time, she has gone from being our very sweet loving baby to<br/>\n&gt; being<br/>\n&gt; &gt;very difficult for anyone in the family to live with.  She spends a lot of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;her time screaming at siblings.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;If the kids take her outside for a walk, it becomes a big long screaming<br/>\n&gt; fit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for Michelle who isn&#39;t happy with anything at all particularly if it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;involves the word &quot;no&quot;.  If we try to play with her, she is very likely to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;grunt loudly at us defiantly and refuse to co-operate in anything.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I just don&#39;t know what to do with her.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t expect her to be like the gifted son and be a super child in her<br/>\n&gt; &gt;abilities, but it would be nice if there was at least reasonable ability to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;communicate with her.  I don&#39;t know how to work with her and help her and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;there isn&#39;t a way to explain anything to her that she is upset and<br/>\n&gt; screaming<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t mean to be one of those mothers who labels her kid and has too much<br/>\n&gt; &gt;expectation.  I just don&#39;t know if everything is okay with her or not.  If<br/>\n&gt; &gt;more time and freedom to do her own thing is all she needs, that would be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;great.  She is free to have it here.  I just don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the case<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and am worried.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Blessings to you,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Kandice<br/>\n&gt; &gt;If I could show you how to make $300-$800+ mo. part-time at home with no<br/>\n&gt; selling, inventory,or huge<br/>\n&gt; &gt;start-up cost, would you like to hear about it?

She<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;draw a line from the &quot;A&quot; to the &quot;B&quot; or put a circle on the &quot;B&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tell me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;there are two balls or three.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;She can&#39;t really make a sentence yet.  We can&#39;t particularly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; communicate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;with her because she doesn&#39;t understand much of what we say unless<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we use<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the very few words in her vocabulary.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;When she talks, we often can figure out what she wants but just as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; often,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;can&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;She spends a lot of her time throwing fits of frustration and being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stubborn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;about everything and anything.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;She was raised as a baby very lovingly by both me and my husband.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;very pampered and never left to cry.  We just loved her to death.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;started acting this way at about 3 years old and I wonder if she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;autistic to some degree.  I have heard that this usually occurs at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about 3<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;years.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Since that time, she has gone from being our very sweet loving baby<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;very difficult for anyone in the family to live with.  She spends a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lot of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;her time screaming at siblings.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;If the kids take her outside for a walk, it becomes a big long<br/>\n&gt; &gt; screaming<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;for Michelle who isn&#39;t happy with anything at all particularly if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;involves the word &quot;no&quot;.  If we try to play with her, she is very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; likely to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;grunt loudly at us defiantly and refuse to co-operate in anything.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I just don&#39;t know what to do with her.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I don&#39;t expect her to be like the gifted son and be a super child<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;abilities, but it would be nice if there was at least reasonable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ability to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;communicate with her.  I don&#39;t know how to work with her and help<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;there isn&#39;t a way to explain anything to her that she is upset and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; screaming<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;about.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I don&#39;t mean to be one of those mothers who labels her kid and has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; too much<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;expectation.  I just don&#39;t know if everything is okay with her or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not.  If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;more time and freedom to do her own thing is all she needs, that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;great.  She is free to have it here.

(like multiplication tables!)  i dont want to have them hate those kinds<br/>\n&gt; of things, but i do want them to realize its not so bad to do things that<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t fun-- there is even a great sense of accomplishment there!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; my 10yo says she feels behind in things (obviously compared to someone!<br/>\n&gt; probably her one close friend who goes to school and is doing homework all<br/>\n&gt; the time!)  it is hard, tho we try, to get across the concept of arbitrarily<br/>\n&gt; assigned knowledge and also everyone having a different set of life<br/>\n&gt; experiences and so NONE of us knowing the same things...  so i let her peruse<br/>\n&gt; a book that is one of those that says what 4th graders are learning in<br/>\n&gt; school, so she would actually see on paper what things her school peers might<br/>\n&gt; be being taught and therefore perhaps not be intimidated that there is really<br/>\n&gt; much she might be missing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; speaking of four year olds, i just love this age, and it does sound like<br/>\n&gt; something is going on with your sweetie, kandace.  i hope you are able to<br/>\n&gt; check into the autism and allergies (both good sounding suggestions) and<br/>\n&gt; narrow down her situation so she can be releived of her frustrations and<br/>\n&gt; return to herself!  best wishes, there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; one more abstract thought...  i wonder how many of you have an unschooling<br/>\n&gt; approach that reflects the active learning, conscious seeking out of info to<br/>\n&gt; answer ideas that come up-- constantly diligent and aware of opportunities to<br/>\n&gt; educate and absorb etc, verses the learning is happening whether you TRY or<br/>\n&gt; not method?  i see these as some distinctions in unschoolers approaches...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; erin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 8<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 16 Aug 2000 22:49:33 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Joseph May&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:j1986@...\">j1986@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: My 4 year old<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kandice,<br/>\n&gt; I know exactly what you are going through.

He also was uncontrolable. Screaming fits, frustritated very easily. I decided on a whim to go to an ENT DR. I found out he could not hear. He had fluid build up behind his ears(not due to ear infections) and his adnoide were 80% enlarged. I asked why no one found this sooner. DR. said no one ever did a tampanagram (SP?) on him. The funny thing was he could pass a regular hearing test.. Tubes went in the ears, adnoids and toncisls came out. He cried the first time he heard a plane fly over. He didn&#39;t know what it was.

I was thinking about this very question as I typed:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; While I am close to your view on abortion, are you sure you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; support legislation of morality?  Laws against murder, rape, theft,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; etc.?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your supposition that I would state abortion is different since it is a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;victimless crime&quot; is close. The &quot;victim&quot; factor in an abortion cannot be<br/>\n&gt; measured without some level of spiritual bias, since the very<br/>\n&gt; nature/definition of the victim is in question. However, in a rape or murder<br/>\n&gt; where the victim is a person whom is unquestionably sentient and<br/>\n&gt; alive-irregardless of personal beliefs, the crime clearly has a victim.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Even for these other crimes, the legislation of morality is complex.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Not all killing is murder, legally.  And, I might argue, there are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; times when theft (i.e. if one is starving) might be justified.  All<br/>\n&gt; &gt; intriguing issues.  But clearly ones I&#39;d hope we&#39;d legislate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Excellent points.  It would be foolish of me to think there is any<br/>\n&gt; legislation in existence which is not based on morality of some sort, but in<br/>\n&gt; these cases the ethic of &quot;the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the<br/>\n&gt; few&quot; seems to guide what legislation takes place.  As soon as humans began<br/>\n&gt; to live in societies of significant numbers, certain necessary &quot;rules&quot;<br/>\n&gt; became evident to ensure the safety of the civilization and individual<br/>\n&gt; property rights. Let&#39;s be harsh for a moment, and say: since unborn babies<br/>\n&gt; are not yet &quot;property&quot;, but the woman carrying the child is, her welfare<br/>\n&gt; overrides the potential real estate inside her womb.  I suppose this leads<br/>\n&gt; me to argue that making abortion illegal doesn&#39;t serve the purpose of<br/>\n&gt; ensuring the safety of the civilization, people and property at large in the<br/>\n&gt; U.S.-excepting in a purely long distance survival/future shock sort of way.<br/>\n&gt; Given the world population dilemma, this is not something which is much of a<br/>\n&gt; concern right now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To those reading-I use the term &quot;property&quot; in the most abstract sense.

I was triggered by your conversation on this subject of abortion, human rights, hunger, over population, and many other attrocities.  I remember the comment of a swollen belly from hunger, I believe over population, medically & naturally is a direct effect of hunger, and diseased standards of living.  When one country has let&#39;s say 50 % of the resources of the world, the other countries get to scramble & divide the other 50%, throw in another money full country, and there goes another 30%  throw in a few more, and few with less, SOMEBODY ends up with NOthing!  If all the water is moved, all the seeds, and food are grown here, and there, but not there, cause they just can&#39;t afford it.  SOMEBODY starves.  When SOMEBODY is in a constant state of malnutrition, and war, and lack of &quot;natural resources&quot; , I think our bodies & genetically we are directly affected. I think that naturally our bodies are meant to flourish & be healthy, in  just about every environment known to man, with a fair distribution of resources.  Now let&#39;s just say, as a hypothesis that when under undue or unchangeable stress the body acts in such a way that  defenses are put out into the bodies system, and that one of those defenses just happens to be fertility for the survival of the species. A NAtural occurance.  If this were the case which I believe it IS.  Over population would be a lessening factor in our Equal HUman RIght s struggle, because the &quot;evening&quot; of resources would allow for &quot;ALL&quot; people to have a fair , healthy & interchangeable relationship with our Homes, the Earth.  I believe this the planet we live on is actually like the garden of Eden, everything, that each spirit-(&)-body that exists here needs to survive & flourish , there are resources for a sustainable living & path of the creature...we only have too many greedy bodies, taking too much from the rest of the folks.<br/>\n&gt;  Abortion is such a touchy and deep subject, I do not believe &quot;spiritually&quot; that anyone can make a definitive &quot;logical&quot; denomination from never having such an experience.  You would need to walk in the shoes of the person on the road you condemn, before you would know if they were truly wrong unto themselves, and unto that which they were learning in this lifetime......who are we to judge.(in other words)  Ofcourse there is what I would feel to be an abuse, when it come to abortion, but will I place myself in the seat of Judgement to inflict my place in truth on someone else?  No.  Truth is found only within, not without, and even if I tried to place  judgement upon someone else it would not affect their truth within themselves, any more, than taking them farther from there own , by defense.  Death is crucial, and an integral part of experience in life.  ALl species are affected by it..no one is spared.  So I do what is most beneficial to my own survival, & that of my family, & being in tune with rythms of the natural world are the most trustworthy ways, &quot;I&quot; have found.  It is all we truly have to rely on that is true to itself, true to it&#39;s surroudings, true to the future & the past......it is a weave of many different experiences, and we should honor all stages of it, for my experiences are based in my life..and them in there&#39;s .  Ofcourse it is natural for us to move away from or remove ourselves from experiences we find to be inadequate or unaccepteable based on our feelings...that is just as natural.  But I &quot;personally &quot; try  to recognize something just as it is,why base my beliefs for fear I will be like it or condone it.  Honoring everything in it&#39;s place allows me to justify even more clearly why I do not want something in my lifeor teaches me ther is more to learn here.  ANd makes actions I do not think are conducive to my growth, more &quot; recognizeable&quot; allowing me to more easily avoid them.  But on those perchance meetings , out of the blue, well, I honor them, I donot , or at least I try not to &quot;JUDGE&quot; them, for that is not my place.  I am hear to learn & teach .......there is so much to learn & teach.

Yes, more women should take responsibility<br/>\n&gt; for their actions, however, the resulting life should not be punished<br/>\n&gt; because someone thinks they should be forced to have that unwanted child.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This isn&#39;t a perfect world and no one has the right to make moral decisions<br/>\n&gt; for someone else.  If the pro-lifers have their way there will be many<br/>\n&gt; deaths from back alley abortions.  There will also be instances of women<br/>\n&gt; having to go to term and then delivering terminally deformed or dead<br/>\n&gt; fetuses.  We had several cases of fetuses that were not complete and would<br/>\n&gt; have continued to term but would have &quot;died&quot; shortly after birth and would<br/>\n&gt; have only lived that short time on machines.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I had the misfortune of working in the radiology department of a large<br/>\n&gt; hospital.  All the child abuse cases came through our department as the law<br/>\n&gt; required full body x-rays to be done to check for prior injuries.  While<br/>\n&gt; some of you may express the sentiments that you would rather be abused than<br/>\n&gt; aborted, I&#39;m sure there are others that would disagree.  I&#39;m sure the child<br/>\n&gt; we came to know as &quot;Sunny&quot; would have preferred not to be born than to have<br/>\n&gt; cigerettes put out on his little legs; than to have needles broken off<br/>\n&gt; under his fingernails; than to be thrown through a window and left outside<br/>\n&gt; all night; than to be later returned to his parents because they were<br/>\n&gt; &quot;cured&quot; after counseling.  Did I mention that &quot;Sunny&quot; was 11 months old and<br/>\n&gt; that we were all threatened with jail because we faked continuing medical<br/>\n&gt; problems and kept him in the hospital for 3 extra months.  Oh, in case I<br/>\n&gt; forgot to mention it, 6 weeks after we were forced to release him from the<br/>\n&gt; hospital to his parents, he was dead.  AND, at the trial, the mother was<br/>\n&gt; heard to say &quot;See, if I&#39;d had that abortion we wouldn&#39;t be going to jail<br/>\n&gt; now.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can give you lots more of those kind of cases that I personally<br/>\n&gt; witnessed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lynda, who quite working there because she was about 1 day away from<br/>\n&gt; murdering some sorry excuse for a parent!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jaam1224@...\">Jaam1224@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] our bodies<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Date: Wednesday, August 16, 2000 12:11 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I agree on many points Amy has brought up (adoption from other countries<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tons of abuse in our country), but I don&#39;t believe abortion is the answer<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; over-population or the solution to not wanting a baby ....(this is going<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sound crude and there are exceptions to everything) but I have a huge<br/>\n&gt; problem<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with women using abortion as a means of birth control.

You have such a<br/>\n&gt; reassuring way with words!  With the new traditional school year having just<br/>\n&gt; begun here in Evansville, I had a pang of doubt in unschooling.  My oldest<br/>\n&gt; would have started kdg this year, had we gone that route, and so I found<br/>\n&gt; myself wanting to push academic activities on him earlier this week on<br/>\n&gt; Monday (the first day of local school).  Well, it was a terrible day, and a<br/>\n&gt; very l-o-n-g day.  I don&#39;t know what got into me, just fear I guess.  The<br/>\n&gt; old former teacher in me reared her head, and I let it control me.  Needless<br/>\n&gt; to say, I backed off, and Tuesday was so much better.  :)  It may be<br/>\n&gt; something I will struggle with off and on-- hope not too much, though.<br/>\n&gt; So, again, I just wanted to say how I enjoyed your post, and how it spoke to<br/>\n&gt; me.  ~Karen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 19<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 17 Aug 2000 00:31:35 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: Sonia Ulan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sulan@...\">sulan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: our bodies-Julie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; VERY well put, Julie and Karen!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sonia<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 20<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 17 Aug 2000 01:07:08 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: Sonia Ulan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sulan@...\">sulan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: My 4 year old<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Kandice;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is there a chance your delicious daughter could be affected by<br/>\n&gt; vaccinations?  There are many who theorize some of us do react to infant<br/>\n&gt; vaccinations and your situation could be the result 3-4 years<br/>\n&gt; later...Perhaps a homeopath could shed some light?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Whatever the cause, she will certainly thrive in your tender,<br/>\n&gt; supportive, sensitive and loving care!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some behaviorial problems can be tempered with a routine the child can<br/>\n&gt; count on.  My best friend&#39;s daughter struggled with behaviorial and<br/>\n&gt; communicative frustrations until almost 5 when SUDDENLY her<br/>\n&gt; speech/vocabulary improved sufficiently that she could communicate more<br/>\n&gt; effectively.  My friend also tried limiting refined sugars and white<br/>\n&gt; flour.  Food sensitivities can be under-diagnosed and explain some of<br/>\n&gt; what you might be seeing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good luck!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sonia<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kandice Crockett wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My daughter finally began calling us Mommy and Daddy at 3 years or so old<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but mixed the names up for quite a while and still sometimes.  She can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; draw a line from the &quot;A&quot; to the &quot;B&quot; or put a circle on the &quot;B&quot; or tell me if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there are two balls or three.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She can&#39;t really make a sentence yet.  We can&#39;t particularly communicate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with her because she doesn&#39;t understand much of what we say unless we use<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the very few words in her vocabulary.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When she talks, we often can figure out what she wants but just as often, we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She spends a lot of her time throwing fits of frustration and being stubborn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about everything and anything.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She was raised as a baby very lovingly by both me and my husband.  She was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very pampered and never left to cry.  We just loved her to death.  But she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; started acting this way at about 3 years old and I wonder if she isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; autistic to some degree.  I have heard that this usually occurs at about 3<br/>\n&gt; &gt; years.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Since that time, she has gone from being our very sweet loving baby to being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very difficult for anyone in the family to live with.  She spends a lot of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her time screaming at siblings.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If the kids take her outside for a walk, it becomes a big long screaming fit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for Michelle who isn&#39;t happy with anything at all particularly if it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; involves the word &quot;no&quot;.  If we try to play with her, she is very likely to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grunt loudly at us defiantly and refuse to co-operate in anything.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I just don&#39;t know what to do with her.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t expect her to be like the gifted son and be a super child in her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; abilities, but it would be nice if there was at least reasonable ability to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; communicate with her.  I don&#39;t know how to work with her and help her and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there isn&#39;t a way to explain anything to her that she is upset and screaming<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t mean to be one of those mothers who labels her kid and has too much<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expectation.  I just don&#39;t know if everything is okay with her or not.  If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more time and freedom to do her own thing is all she needs, that would be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; great.  She is free to have it here.  I just don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the case<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and am worried.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Blessings to you,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kandice<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If I could show you how to make $300-$800+ mo. part-time at home with no selling, inventory,or huge<br/>\n&gt; &gt; start-up cost, would you like to hear about it?
