But still, <br/>\npulling it when it&#39;s green will prevent MANY stickers from going home in kids&#39; <br/>\nshoes to stay in carpets (or worse, get a running barefoot or thong-footed kid  <br/>\na bloody puncture).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you come to New Mexico, as what goat heads look like so you won&#39;t walk <br/>\nin them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI checked google.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a photo of a non-native missionary and a little blurb about &quot;Goat&#39;s <br/>\nHead&quot;  stickers.  They&#39;re wrong about that two prong thing.  Three down one up.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re right about it penetrating a tennis shoe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two little flat round things on either side of his shovel are goat head <br/>\nplants.  Small ones.  If that yard got some water, and one was growing where <br/>\nhe&#39;s standing, it could get big enough to fill up most of the ground in the <br/>\nphoto, three feet from him in every direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when you dig them up you have to put them in the trash, because just <br/>\nthrowing them aside won&#39;t keep the stickers from still developing.  Once they&#39;re <br/>\nformed there&#39;s nothing left but for them to dry, but when they&#39;re growing they <br/>\ngrow three in a bunch, and they&#39;re pudgy and light green, a little like the <br/>\neyes on a potato, but all the same shape.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the only thing I found on the internet.
