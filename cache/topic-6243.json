Most people when they speak<br/>\n  of attachment parenting, they are talking about a lifestyle term that<br/>\n  was coined by Dr. Bill and Martha Sears, pediatrician, La Leche<br/>\n  League Leader and parents to eight children.  Many people think<br/>\n  of AP (attachment parenting) as natural parenting, and often this<br/>\n  type of parenting can be found in non-industrialized cultures and<br/>\n  considered the norm.  Most Americans practicing AP start from<br/>\n  birth, looking to birth their children in the gentle environment,<br/>\n  breastfeeding and sleep sharing, and carrying your baby/child in<br/>\n  a sling or in arms.  Crying it out and physical punishment<br/>\n  are not considered AP.  You do not have to have done all of the<br/>\n  above practices to be AP I believe, (example; some women may not have had<br/>\n  all the correct information or support to breastfeed their child, but<br/>\npractice<br/>\n  other attachment/bonding practices).  In turn these practices help you and<br/>\n  your child become in tune with each other, so you can better parent etc.<br/>\n  There are tons of sites on the<br/>\n  web where you can learn more about this.  Hope this helps! ps. I think<br/>\nthat<br/>\n  homeschooling/unschooling is a very natural progression from and early<br/>\n  APing lifestyle.<br/>\n  Kathy<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--<br/>\n  Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n  Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 4<br/>\n   Date: Sat, 5 Feb 2000 12:55:34 EST<br/>\n   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Natrlmama@...\">Natrlmama@...</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: Gardening Zones<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 02/03/2000 10:31:39 AM Pacific Standard Time,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hooperck@...\">hooperck@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;<br/>\n All you gardening people, I stumbled into a great newsletter from<br/>\n Organic Gardening.

Our discussions over the<br/>\n  &gt; years have shown that it was much more traumatic than I realized for<br/>\nthem<br/>\n  &gt; even though they adjusted okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes, already I have become faintly aware of this. Our 12yo who has wanted<br/>\nfor<br/>\n  always to move to the country, started exhibiting strange behaviour, and<br/>\nit<br/>\n  emerged that although he loves living here, he was still going through a<br/>\nmajor<br/>\n  grieving for all that has been his life until now, and has been left<br/>\nbehind. The<br/>\n  2 that weren&#39;t that keen on moving seem almost to be handling it better -<br/>\n  perhaps their low expectations enabled them to be pleasantly surprised!<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I had tried to keep them aware of all<br/>\n  &gt; plans, choices, etc during the change, but they still felt they had no<br/>\n  &gt; choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I do feel bad about this - children have so little choice really, in so<br/>\nmany<br/>\n  areas of their lives. Even when we, as individual families, allow our<br/>\nchildren<br/>\n  choice, they soon become aware that other families don&#39;t work like that,<br/>\nand<br/>\n  that their choice is only theirs by virtue of our choice to allow it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I always found life in general to be a balancing act.  Home birth,<br/>\n  &gt; attachment parenting, homeschooling, all of these things that grow<br/>\nchildren<br/>\n  &gt; so well, and have the potential to grow parents well, too, can also be<br/>\n  &gt; draining if you don&#39;t find the balance that you need.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yeah, and I&#39;ve never been to good at balancing - I always did choose the<br/>\nswing<br/>\n  rather than the seesaw at the playground &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Carol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--<br/>\n  Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n  Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 7<br/>\n   Date: Sat, 5 Feb 2000 18:55:17 -0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Tracy@...\">Tracy@...</a>-online.co.uk&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Books<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an Iain M Banks novel sitting on the office windowsill waiting to be<br/>\nread :-)  I bought it for Father&#39;s Day (or birthday, can&#39;t remember which<br/>\n:-) ) last year, and dh loved it, but I&#39;ve yet to read it :-)  I need to<br/>\nstart reading breastfeeding and ap-type books again, since my LLL<br/>\napplication is getting a kick up the bottom now &lt;g&gt;  I have a second-hand<br/>\ncopy of a book on gardening with mulch, rather than compost, which I like, I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s called the No Work Garden, or something like that!

I met a mom who is very proud that her kids<br/>\n&gt; kindergarten class is so strict bc the children know what the rules<br/>\n&gt; are????<br/>\n<br/>\nhi,<br/>\n<br/>\ni went to a b-day party for a 4 yo recently,  all the other kids there met<br/>\nin<br/>\ndaycare,  we were the only homeschoolers.  i found the dynamic between the<br/>\nparents and kids really distant, not without love but without closeness.<br/>\nthe<br/>\nparent would stand back and say things like &#39;now uses your words&#39; and the<br/>\nkids would be fighting over the toys.  it was odd to me (not the fighting<br/>\npart:),  the kids do their thing and the parents do theirs and &#39;never the<br/>\n&#39;twain shall meet&#39; just bridged by a bit of vocalization.  it made me think<br/>\nthat people keep themselves so busy so they don&#39;t have to see what&#39;s really<br/>\nhappening and if something bad happens they have a good excuse - they were<br/>\ntoo busy.<br/>\n<br/>\ni have a thing about controlling kids.  boundaries are great but control is<br/>\na<br/>\ndifferent story.  i didn&#39;t give birth to prove to the world i can spawn the<br/>\ngreatest person that ever lived (though rene&#39; (4) informed me last night<br/>\nthat<br/>\nhe wants to become &#39;a legend&#39; -i&#39;m not completely convinced he clearly<br/>\nunderstands what that is &lt;lol&gt;) or the most obedient or the kid with the<br/>\nbest<br/>\nmanners or any other of their silly accolades.  i did gave birth to<br/>\nexperience the joy of watching a person develop and find happiness in their<br/>\neveryday life and to be of whatever assistance i am able.  i believe<br/>\ncompassion and good manners are very helpful but only if it is done with<br/>\nsincerity not coercion.  this is my problem with schools.<br/>\n<br/>\ni would be interested in how others step out of the way of their kids and<br/>\nnot<br/>\npass on all the issue based in social conformity.  from what i&#39;ve seen some<br/>\nof the greatest injustices perpetrated against kids is in the name of social<br/>\nconformity.  my son is out spoken - for the good or the bad - i make sure he<br/>\nknows his voice carries weight.  i also let him know when he&#39;s driving me<br/>\nnuts with his incessant talking.   i do not use the word &#39;incessant&#39; lightly<br/>\n- he will talk to anyone anytime for as long as they will sit there.  i can<br/>\nnot even count the number of picnics of total strangers (more often than not<br/>\nadult only) he has invited himself to.  he just parks himself without ever<br/>\nquestioning whether he would be wanted, in his mind of course they would<br/>\nwant<br/>\nto hear what he has to say:)<br/>\n<br/>\ni am not embarrassed by anything he does.  at first i was tempted to feel he<br/>\nwas a reflection of me and i would be judged by other because of his<br/>\nbehavior,  but you know so what.  i know people judge,  their thoughts are<br/>\nso &#39;loud&#39; you can&#39;t help but know.  what i&#39;ve found is,  trying to control<br/>\n(the use of rules) kids or anyone,  sets you up for a power struggle then<br/>\nyou<br/>\nhave to ask yourself &#39;is this really the kind of relationship i want?&#39; and &#39;<br/>\nisn&#39;t this just what i have with my parents (or any other person trying to<br/>\nhave power of you)?&#39;  for me the answers are no and yes respectively.  so i<br/>\naccept that i&#39;m breaking with all my &#39;role models&#39; and that leaves me with<br/>\nalways (at least for now:) having to know why i do what i do and making<br/>\nconscious choices so i don&#39;t fall back into repeating what was done to me<br/>\nand<br/>\ni must afford this right to my kids.  now that i&#39;ve been able to make the<br/>\ntransition i feel life doesn&#39;t need to be scheduled or planned or have a<br/>\ncurriculum to succeed and prosper and be happy but just conscious and<br/>\nsincere<br/>\ninvolvement is needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe other thing i wanted to touch on is that there has been a lot of<br/>\ndiscussion about waldorf, which to be honest i only lightly touched on as<br/>\nfar<br/>\nas reading the emails.  it&#39;s not a big interest of mine though they do<br/>\nprovide nice products albeit a bit expensive but very good quality.   i<br/>\nlooked into becoming a waldorf teacher when i lived in northern cal.  but<br/>\nbacked away.  for me it&#39;s too structured and imposes a reality on to the<br/>\nenvironment rather than allowing one to develop of it&#39;s own accord.   i&#39;m<br/>\nnot<br/>\nas well read on the specific differences between these philosophies because<br/>\ni<br/>\nmake mine up as i go and find i&#39;m much happier doing it that way.   it&#39;s<br/>\nhard<br/>\nfor me to conform to even the alternative methods and this is why i&#39;m on<br/>\nthis<br/>\nlist because for me unschooling is more of a philosophical base and methods<br/>\nsuch as waldorf are more of a structure you &#39;live&#39;

Andersen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andersen@...\">andersen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: We Want Our Children to Be Suckers!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe Want Our Children to Be Suckers!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes.  That&#39;s right.  We hope our children become real suckers.  And we also<br/>\nwant them to be suck-sessful adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe derived our non-traditional definition of sucker from Henry David Thoreau<br/>\n&#39;s words in his classic Walden.  He wrote that he &quot;...went to the woods to<br/>\nlive deliberately...to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA sucker single-mindedly goes after that marrow.  A sucker hungers for<br/>\nknowledge.  A sucker notes the changes of seasons, the migration of birds,<br/>\nthe budding of flowers, the artistry of the morning dew.  A sucker is as<br/>\ncomfortable with the technology of the present as the wisdom of the ages.  A<br/>\nsucker is deeply moved in the face of human triumph or tragedy.  A sucker is<br/>\nall there, fully awake, completely embracing all that life has to offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSound like a worthy goal for children?  We think so.  Here are three steps<br/>\nto help children learn to be suckers:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBe a sucker yourself<br/>\n<br/>\nModel a passion for learning.  Be open-minded.  Try new things all of the<br/>\ntime.  Focus on stockpiling experiences rather than material objects.<br/>\nTravel slowly, stopping and lingering along the way.  Chat with the people<br/>\nyou meet.  Savor your food.  Don&#39;t jump to conclusions.  Pick the minds of<br/>\npeople who know the ropes.  Enjoy sunrises and sunsets. Become adept at<br/>\nlooking through telescopes, microscopes, and just under your nose.  When<br/>\nyour children see how much fun you&#39;re having, nothing will stop them from<br/>\njoining in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGive children time and space<br/>\n<br/>\nOverscheduling our children&#39;s lives may make them into &quot;successes&quot; in the<br/>\neyes of the world, but it won&#39;t help them to be suckers. For that you&#39;ve got<br/>\nto leave them alone.  Let them build their play forts, play their street<br/>\ngames, and experiment in the kitchen.  Encourage creativity.  Expose them to<br/>\nthe very best in life and let them choose what they want.  Give them the<br/>\ntinder and matches, but let them light their own fires of passion.  The<br/>\nability to suck the marrow out of life comes slowly over many years.  So don<br/>\n&#39;t expect immediate, quantifiable results.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSeek inspiration from other suckers<br/>\n<br/>\nMandy and I place our faith in the premise that &quot;a sucker is born every<br/>\nminute.&quot;  We believe that everyone can be a sucker, but too many get lured<br/>\naway from that. They may be led to believe that happiness has to do with<br/>\nmoney, status, or position.  Far too often those pursuits engulf lives, and<br/>\ndistract would-be suckers from the path.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a positive note, you can find real suckers everywhere.  They are the ones<br/>\nwho are involved and active.  They are multi-faceted people, always<br/>\nlearning, always growing, always changing.  Such people need to be  your<br/>\nlifelines.  You can also read about great suckers in history; people who did<br/>\nextraordinary things, who were committed to living each day to the fullest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lifelong quest<br/>\n<br/>\nSuck-sess has to do with cutting through the veneer of life and getting at<br/>\nits essence.  It has to do with throwing out agendas and living<br/>\nspontaneously.   It&#39;s about bringing our exterior world in harmony with our<br/>\ninterior.  It&#39;s about reducing our baggage.  It&#39;s about getting wrapped up<br/>\nin the ecstasy of the moment rather than postponing happiness for a later<br/>\ndate.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a nutshell, suck-sess is the nectar of life.  That&#39;s why we&#39;re so intent<br/>\non teaching our children how to be real suckers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Andersen is a professional &quot;rug sucker&quot; (carpet cleaner) in Portland,<br/>\nOregon.
