She had a number of friends, but kept in contact with them.&nbsp; Over \ntime, however, she has lost interest in those friends.&nbsp; She feels most of \nthem are &quot;sheep,&quot; following along with others to stay popular.&nbsp; Just last \nnight we had a conversation about her one remaining friend from school, who had \nalways &quot;marched to her own drum&quot; like my daughter. My daughter had a \nconversation with her yesterday on Instant Messaging, and said even that friend \nhas become too much like a sheep.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">She enjoys her new friends more - the ones she \nhas met at church, the other homeschoolers she meets... she wishes she had more \nfriends that live closer to us (our homeschool group is on the other side of \ntown), but I do try and make sure she sees friends often. She also calls and \ninstant messages them as well.&nbsp; We are fortunate that we found some other \nunschoolers that live close by, as well.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">I also have explained to my daughter that, in \nschool, you may attend classes with your friends, but you don&#39;t really &quot;talk&quot; or \n&quot;play&quot; in the middle of class.&nbsp; There&#39;s lunch and recess, but that&#39;s about \nit.&nbsp; We can spend all day with friends if they want to... and our friends \ndon&#39;t have to worry about staying home in the evenings to do homework, \neither.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">So, I guess my message is, yes your daughters \nmay feel sad that they won&#39;t be spending as much time with their friends at \nschool... but hopefully they will soon find friends that they have more in \ncommon with, and can actually spend more time with, in their &quot;new lifestyle,&quot; \nshould you decide to homeschool them.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">Robin</font></div>\n<div><font color=\"#000080\" size=\"2\">Orlando, FL<br>&nbsp; \n:-)</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6663,"nextTopicId":8649}}
