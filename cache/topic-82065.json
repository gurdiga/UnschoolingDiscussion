Mrs. Williams. Every Friday we had a test. The first two <br/>\nquestions were: Name the seven continents. Name the five oceans. We ALL had to get <br/>\nthem ALL right---AND correctly spelled. Or we had the same two first questions <br/>\nAGAIN the NEXT Friday. The tests started the second Friday in September. We <br/>\nhad those first two questions until the second Friday in JANUARY!  I guess <br/>\nsometimes the school process works----or was it our personal desires to NEVER have <br/>\nthese two questions again that drove 16 children to FINALLY learn what they <br/>\nwere and how to spell them?<br/>\n<br/>\nContinents:<br/>\nNorth  America<br/>\nSouth America <br/>\nAfrica<br/>\nAustralia<br/>\nEurope <br/>\nAsia<br/>\nAntarctica<br/>\n<br/>\nOceans:<br/>\nPacific<br/>\nAtlantic<br/>\nIndian<br/>\nMediterranean<br/>\nArctic<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd come to find out when Cameron was in fifth grade that the Mediterranean <br/>\nis no longer considered an ocean! The South Ocean is now one of the five. Go <br/>\nfigure. I had to learn to spell Mediterranean for no good reason! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSeven seas? I&#39;m guessing that there are five oceans and the seven seas (that <br/>\nsea-faring Europeans were surrounded by and would have sailed): Mediterranean, <br/>\nBaltic, Black, Red, Caspian, Adriatic, and Arabian (Persian Gulf).
