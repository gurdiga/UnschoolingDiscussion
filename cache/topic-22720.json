It&#39;s<br/>\ncurrently housed on the top bunk of his bed.  We have ten foot ceilings in<br/>\nthis house.  The boxes are packed inside each other and the pile goes up to<br/>\nthe ceiling.  Sometimes older brother has to help get down &#39;just the one&#39;<br/>\nthe little brother remembers.  Hint to Sherry: along with the tape buy<br/>\nplenty of aluminum foil, string, and tacky craft glue.  We&#39;ve got a rule<br/>\nthat only Mom or big brother can use the box cutter -- learned the hard way.<br/>\nThe styrofoam packaging material is also really neat for some projects.<br/>\nLast week&#39;s projects included a shield and sword to go along with the<br/>\ncastle.  Robots, computers, spacecraft, cities, have all taken up residence<br/>\nin our livingroom, diningroom, kitchen, hallways......Great free source for<br/>\nlearning.  Grandparents, neighbors, friends, and local merchants all know my<br/>\nson&#39;s love for boxes and provide a seemingly endless supply.<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting:  The best suggestion I ever found to encourage writing was years<br/>\nago when my sons were little.  I think it was a book or magazine article<br/>\ncalled &quot;The Writing Box&quot;.  You take an old briefcase, plastic box with<br/>\nhandle, whatever can be easily carried by a young child.  Fill it with<br/>\npencils, crayons, markers, paper of all sizes/shapes/colors, envelopes,<br/>\nstamps, stickers, etc.  Take this box where ever your child goes.  Car<br/>\ntrips, errands, doctor&#39;s visits, trips to grandma&#39;s etc.  Step back and let<br/>\nthe kid go.  Do NOT put in any coloring book type stuff.   Be prepared to<br/>\nreceive lots of &#39;mail&#39;.  If you include post-it-notes you&#39;ll also have a lot<br/>\nof them around the house.  My youngest learned to read and write all the<br/>\nnames of things by sticking his self-made sticky-notes to anything and<br/>\neverthing in our house!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nJan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;    From: Barb Eaton &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:homemama@...\">homemama@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: writing and unschoolin<br/>\n&gt;    From: Sherry Hagen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oilmagic@...\">oilmagic@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: cardboard boxes<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22712,"nextTopicId":22675}}
