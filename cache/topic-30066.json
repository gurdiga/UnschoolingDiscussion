Not just emotionally from a hard-working and <br/>\nover-taxed mom, but from a dad (his childhood history is enough to make <br/>\nyou cry).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the fact that his beating were sadistic and sometimes rendered us <br/>\nunconscious was a blessing in disguise. Somehow, out of 5 children, not <br/>\none of us hits our children or even has to fight it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbuse, be it emotional, physical or spiritual DOES tend to find itself <br/>\nrepeating from one generation to another.<br/>\n<br/>\nElsa, your choice in attachment parenting as opposed to mimic your <br/>\nparents is one that I&#39;m sure was not easy. Good luck and lots of <br/>\nblessings in your endeavors.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nkolleen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30061,"nextTopicId":30068}}
