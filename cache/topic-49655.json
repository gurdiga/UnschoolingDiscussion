She was in preschool 7 1/2 <br/>\nhours a week last year, just to give us a break from eachother.  I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t realize they were getting her all excited about going to <br/>\nkindergarten this year, so of course she wanted to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found a pretty cool school, they don&#39;t grade, they have time for <br/>\nindependent projects, etc, and I got pretty excited about it myself.  <br/>\nThe first day of kindy, my sensitive little girl came out bawling <br/>\nabout how she much she hated it(there are a few little brats that <br/>\nlike to hit, spit, etc.).  By that time I was so blinded by how great <br/>\nI thought the school was going to be, I convinced her to stay.  She <br/>\ncried everyday for 3 weeks about something that had happened during <br/>\nthe day, but she seemed to want to go back (I should mention here <br/>\nthat my daughter has a sensory integration disorder, so crying daily <br/>\nis normal for her).  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow at 10 weeks of school, after me spending nearly one day a week <br/>\nvolunteering in the classroom, I see that I really don&#39;t want her <br/>\nstaying there.  I feel horrible for ignoring her instincts those <br/>\nfirst couple weeks, but now she loves it, and whenever I mention <br/>\nhomeschooling, she freaks out and says she wants to stay at school.  <br/>\nShe really loves her friends and teacher and recess, and so do I, but <br/>\nthe room is stressful and chaotic, there are just too many 5yos in <br/>\none place.  She&#39;s gotten used to the stress, but it can&#39;t be good for <br/>\nher.  The poor little thing has had dark circles under her eyes since <br/>\nthe first day of school.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is do I listen to her and leave her in school?  How do I <br/>\nget her in touch with those initial bad feelings she had about school <br/>\nafter I made her supress them?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to have her make friends with other homeschoolers, so she <br/>\nwould want to just stay home and play with them, but I&#39;m finding most <br/>\nhomeschoolers around here don&#39;t want to play everyday like we do.  <br/>\nThey like to be isolated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve asked other homeschooler parents what to do and of course they <br/>\nlook at me like I&#39;m crazy and say, &quot;you&#39;re the parent, pull her <br/>\nout!&quot;  I know my daughter has to make that choice, doesn&#39;t she? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard, I do like the school, they play and make bread, there&#39;s no <br/>\nacedemic pressure.   The other parents and even her teacher <br/>\nunderstand my desire to unschool, but still it is more &quot;schooly&quot; than <br/>\nI expected, and ultimately not what I want for my daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

I have a 5yo daughter who I had always planned on unschooling","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1729735580\">I&#39;ve been lurking on this site for a month now, and I know I can <br/>\ntrust the opinion of you guys.<br/>\nI have a 5yo daughter who I had always planned on unschooling at some <br/>\npoint, I wanted to leave it up to her.  She was in preschool 7 1/2 <br/>\nhours a week last year, just to give us a break from eachother.  I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t realize they were getting her all excited about going to <br/>\nkindergarten this year, so of course she wanted to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found a pretty cool school, they don&#39;t grade, they have time for <br/>\nindependent projects, etc, and I got pretty excited about it myself.  <br/>\nThe first day of kindy, my sensitive little girl came out bawling <br/>\nabout how she much she hated it(there are a few little brats that <br/>\nlike to hit, spit, etc.).  By that time I was so blinded by how great <br/>\nI thought the school was going to be, I convinced her to stay.  She <br/>\ncried everyday for 3 weeks about something that had happened during <br/>\nthe day, but she seemed to want to go back (I should mention here <br/>\nthat my daughter has a sensory integration disorder, so crying daily <br/>\nis normal for her).  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow at 10 weeks of school, after me spending nearly one day a week <br/>\nvolunteering in the classroom, I see that I really don&#39;t want her <br/>\nstaying there.  I feel horrible for ignoring her instincts those <br/>\nfirst couple weeks, but now she loves it, and whenever I mention <br/>\nhomeschooling, she freaks out and says she wants to stay at school.  <br/>\nShe really loves her friends and teacher and recess, and so do I, but <br/>\nthe room is stressful and chaotic, there are just too many 5yos in <br/>\none place.  She&#39;s gotten used to the stress, but it can&#39;t be good for <br/>\nher.  The poor little thing has had dark circles under her eyes since <br/>\nthe first day of school.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is do I listen to her and leave her in school?  How do I <br/>\nget her in touch with those initial bad feelings she had about school <br/>\nafter I made her supress them?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to have her make friends with other homeschoolers, so she <br/>\nwould want to just stay home and play with them, but I&#39;m finding most <br/>\nhomeschoolers around here don&#39;t want to play everyday like we do.  <br/>\nThey like to be isolated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve asked other homeschooler parents what to do and of course they <br/>\nlook at me like I&#39;m crazy and say, &quot;you&#39;re the parent, pull her <br/>\nout!&quot;  I know my daughter has to make that choice, doesn&#39;t she? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard, I do like the school, they play and make bread, there&#39;s no <br/>\nacedemic pressure.   The other parents and even her teacher <br/>\nunderstand my desire to unschool, but still it is more &quot;schooly&quot; than <br/>\nI expected, and ultimately not what I want for my daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49671,"nextTopicId":49634}}
