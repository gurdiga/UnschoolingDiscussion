I originally sent this message on the 17th, and have never seen it post.<br/>\nI also sent another message to an indidual who never received it, at the same <br/>\ntime.<br/>\nSo.. I&#39;m resending, and if you&#39;ve all seen it before, I do apologize!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I&#39;ve got that &quot;coming home&quot; feeling right now.<br/>\nThe line from Rocky Mt High.. &quot;Coming home to a place you&#39;ve never been <br/>\nbefore&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am soooo glad to have found this group.  It feels wonderful.<br/>\nMy name is Laura, husband Chip, we&#39;ve been married almost 15 years.<br/>\nWe have three kids. Jeremy, 9.  Emily,7 and Luke 4 in a few weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents gave me this lifestyle the best they could in the 70&#39;s.  But it<br/>\nwas illegal in Illinois to homeschool.  So off I went to school, to get my <br/>\nsleep.<br/>\nWhen I got home, thats when the learning started.  <br/>\nMy mom is an artist, and I was constantly exposed to great works of art, <br/>\nincredible<br/>\nmusic and very eclectic forms of any kind of art.<br/>\nWe watched movies galore, classics.  Educational, historical, I LOVE epics.<br/>\n(And Mel Gibson being in many epics these days kept that interest up..ahem.)<br/>\nIn 1976, they took me on the best vacation they could think of....<br/>\nI was taken to Williamsburg Virginia for a re enactment of several battles<br/>\nof the Revolutionary War.  I came home with a love for that period that has<br/>\nremained my entire life.  I knew more about this time frame than did my<br/>\nhistory teacher.  A fact that at first upset him, then he was intrigued and <br/>\nwas invited to my home for dinner.  He thanked my parents for instilling a <br/>\nlove<br/>\nof  history in my life.  Maybe at the time, I didn&#39;t appreciate what he meant.<br/>\nNow I do.  It was very touching.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the minute Jeremy was born, I looked at this beautiful little boy and <br/>\nthought..<br/>\n&quot;No way will I turn him over to quacks in five years!&quot;  It was literally one <br/>\nof my first<br/>\nthoughts (after having cried my eyes out!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we set out to learn about homeschooling.  I&#39;ve enjoyed the Charlotte Mason<br/>\nmethod and a few pre packaged curriculums, and the book &quot;the Well Trained <br/>\nMind&quot;.<br/>\nThe book actually gave me great ideas on the kids keeping notebooks on worms<br/>\nand such!  <br/>\nBut, I always fell away from what I was doing, no matter how much I enjoyed <br/>\nit.<br/>\nI found the kids saying &quot;Awwww&quot; when I called them to &quot;do school&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had heard of unschooling, but so many had acted like it was a &quot;too far out&quot;<br/>\nidea ..that I had not looked seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it&#39;s Jeremys year to be tested in the state of Colorado.  So I find <br/>\nmyself<br/>\ngetting nervous.  He does NOT know the things other third graders around here<br/>\nknow.  BUT.. he knows SOME high school level things, too.  I worried that<br/>\nthey would test him just like they test the others, and that the areas he is<br/>\ntruly talented in, would not even be asked about.  So, I looked into<br/>\nWest River Academy in Grand Junction, CO.  Peggy sent me info and told<br/>\nme to look at the Unschooling.com website.  YIPEE!<br/>\n(BTW, anyone here that uses West River Academy??)<br/>\n<br/>\nLike minded people!  I&#39;m NOT lazy!  hahhahahahha.. boy does that feel good!<br/>\nA perfect example of how unschooling works.  We like the Math U See <br/>\ncurriculum.<br/>\nMultiplication was just not clicking with Jeremy so I gave myself permission <br/>\nto<br/>\njust put it away.  I would simply ask him a question once in awhile, and if he<br/>\nhesitated, I would supply the answer, offering a brief explanation of how I <br/>\ngot the<br/>\nanswer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout two weeks after starting this, Jeremy was playing with his stuffed <br/>\nanimal<br/>\ncollection on his top bunk.  He began arranging them in groups of three.<br/>\nAt 11 pm that night, he came flying out of his room, yelling &quot;Three, Three <br/>\ntimes!<br/>\nThat&#39;s NINE!&quot;  And took us in to show us the different groupings  and how they<br/>\nrepresented numbers, etc.  <br/>\nI was elated.  Not only did he know multiplication, but he SAW how it worked,<br/>\nhe didn&#39;t just blindly memorize answers!<br/>\nThe next day he happily sat down and filled in about 4 chapters of his math <br/>\nbook,<br/>\nwillingly, without being asked!<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVE this!<br/>\n<br/>\nNice to meet you all!<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15489,"nextTopicId":15492}}
