I have known<br/>\n&gt; people like you have spoken of and it breaks my heart. That is not Godliness<br/>\n&gt; it is opression. My marriage is nothing like that. My husband and I are<br/>\n&gt; partners. We work out our differences. Sometimes I change my mind. Sometimes<br/>\n&gt; he changes his. I don&#39;t disagree with him publicly, but will discuss issues<br/>\n&gt; with him in private. Often he will understand and change his mind. He has a<br/>\n&gt; certain wisdom on some things I do not. I rely and trust in him. He has<br/>\n&gt; never laid a violent hand upon me. My &quot;obedience&quot; comes out of love and<br/>\n&gt; respect for my husband, not fear and intimidation. I believe that is more<br/>\n&gt; like the model God had in mind, not a cowering woman vibrating in fear,but<br/>\n&gt; a confident woman who is strengthened and empowered by the relationship she<br/>\n&gt; has with her husband.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay...but in the same light...does he obey you? Does he disagree with you in <br/>\npublic? If it&#39;s mutual, while it&#39;s not necessarily the model I would choose <br/>\nfor a relationship, I certainly understand.
