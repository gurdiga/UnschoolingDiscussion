Not sure if this got posted <br/>\nor not but I would really LOVE a response in the way of &quot;have you tried <br/>\nthis&quot; or &quot;this might work&quot; from SOMEONE!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, my question was in no way meant to reflect on anything you<br/>\ndid with your kids. I was asking on behalf of myself and my kids.<br/>\nMy son is rather an old soul and so very different from our other 3.<br/>\nMuch more complex. He just doesn&#39;t get keeping his hands to himself<br/>\nwith his sister. I also don&#39;t go with the never hit thing and have<br/>\nexplained that whole scenario. He gets that, he understands that it&#39;s<br/>\nnot nice to hit or even productive within the family. But when his<br/>\nsister frustrates him, like I know she&#39;s good at doing, he just<br/>\nsmacks her without thinking. He knows he shouldn&#39;t, he admits to me<br/>\nthat he did it and why. I just can&#39;t seem to get him to come to me or<br/>\nsay something to her first. His first reaction is to pop her one. Now<br/>\nit&#39;s not really bad.(meaning she&#39;s not really physically hurt) He doesn&#39;t <br/>\nuse anything but his hand and it&#39;s<br/>\nnot a punch or anything and she gets very dramatic when he does it.<br/>\nThe whole thing ends up a major deal on both parts. Whatever I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen saying isn&#39;t getting it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t happen every day but enough for me to worry why I can&#39;t<br/>\nsolve this. You can tell right away he&#39;s sorry he does it but just<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t think about it first. We&#39;ve worked out together all kinds of<br/>\nother ways for him to solve the problem but when the time comes, he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t use any of them. These are the 2 that are 13 months apart.<br/>\nThey are almost 7 and 8.
