I responded as well as I could and <br/>\nforwarded it where  people might be more likely to help.  But I thought an <br/>\nadvance notice that  there will be a homeschooling article there in some coming <br/>\nissue might be of  interest to some here. <br/>\nPhotos of homeschoolers  is a topic that makes me cringe.  I had to get <br/>\npractically MEAN to get a  newspaper supplement editor to STOP insisting that her <br/>\nphotographer was going to  follow us around for a day like she wasn&#39;t even <br/>\nthere, to take pictures of my  kids homeschooling.  Not only was it like the worst <br/>\npossible week (about  this time a couple of years ago, while we were packing <br/>\nup half the house for a  medieval campout) but my kids were actually out DOING <br/>\nand being and learning in  the community, in various highly photogenic ways, <br/>\nnone of which the editor  understood enough to realize were the <br/>\nprize-photo-ops.  Sometimes it seems  photographers aren&#39;t satisfied until there are <br/>\ntextbooks open on the table or a  chemistry set a-bubblin&#39;. <br/>\nThe issue of the kids  actually BEING homeschoolers is dear to me, though.  <br/>\nLife Learning will  have several photos of my kids in the summer issue.  The <br/>\ncovers of another  glossy color homeschooling magazine are just stock generic <br/>\nkids and not really  homeschoolers.   But Mothering might do better with stock <br/>\nphotos than  photos of kids they ignore until they assume the homeschooling  <br/>\nposition. <br/>\nI don&#39;t know who their  writer is for this.  Anyone know? <br/>\n====================== <br/>\nHI  Sandra, <br/>\nWe are preparing to  publish a new piece on homeschooling, and are looking to <br/>\nshoot photos of young  homeschoolers here in Santa Fe. I���ve left a  few <br/>\nmessages with Ed Nagle as well as the appropriate person at  the La  Farge Library <br/>\n(where I hear the community networks but we are on a tight  timeframe and <br/>\nwould greatly appreciate any contacts you can offer.
