I think <br/>\nit&#39;s rubbing off on my husband.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, we were in the bathroom with our 6 yr old, Sophia, <br/>\nhelping her get her bath water just like she likes it.  She <br/>\nundressed but forgot her socks.  When she asked her Dad to &quot;jump&quot; <br/>\nher in the tub, she realized she was still wearing the socks.  My <br/>\nhusband said, &quot;why not?&quot; and &quot;jumped&quot; her into the tub anyway.  She <br/>\ngiggled with glee and then peeled off the wet socks and smacked them <br/>\nagainst the wall, enjoying the noise and our smiling faces.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a good &quot;yes&quot; moment.  Later, I talked with my husband about <br/>\nit.  We discussed how crazy it is that we all have these little <br/>\nrules inside us that don&#39;t mean a thing really, have no reason for <br/>\nbeing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, say &quot;yes&quot; to saying yes! :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103216,"nextTopicId":104275}}
