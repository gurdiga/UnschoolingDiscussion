My child has Thingymabob Disorder.  Has anyone got any ideas for how<br/>\nto handle it?<br/>\nb.  Have you tried oingo-boigo therapy?We used Oingo and it helped for<br/>\nThingymabob Disorder.<br/>\nc.  It must be because of stress in your house. <br/>\nd.  Oingo didn&#39;t work for me so we went to the Dr. Watson Technique, that<br/>\nhelped us.<br/>\nc.  No one here has any problems with Thingymabob Disorder so it must be<br/>\nbecause you don&#39;t do what I do.<br/>\ne.  c. must be right, I listen to her all the time and I don&#39;t have<br/>\nThingymabob Disorder,<br/>\na.  Well, I&#39;ve always done most of the things c. says, but in this case<br/>\ncircumstances don&#39;t allow it.  The Thingymabob Disorder needs to be<br/>\naddressed. <br/>\nc.  Those who do what I do aren&#39;t having any problems but those who don&#39;t<br/>\nhave all these difficulties. They should just listen to me.<br/>\na.  Thank you b. and d.  I tried both of your suggestions and found them<br/>\nvery helpful.  One other thing I found elsewhere was the Franken Furter<br/>\nTreatment.  That was helpful too.  <br/>\nc.  But you still haven&#39;t tried my way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Have you seen the news of Aghanistan?<br/>\n&gt; A bird is in the yard!<br/>\n&gt; Yes, the sun just came out.<br/>\n&gt; My son hates to read.<br/>\n&gt; We love our new church.<br/>\n&gt; When I was little we lived near a church.<br/>\n&gt; The bird is splashing in the water.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No disagreements.<br/>\n&gt; Also no information, and no learning.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And I think there are people who would love for online discussions <br/>\n&gt; to all be <br/>\n&gt; this way:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I keep my child from wearing red because it disturbs me and I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; sure it <br/>\n&gt; would eventually disturb him, and if I let him wear red, I know he <br/>\n&gt; would wear <br/>\n&gt; nothing but red every day for the rest of his life.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;You&#39;re such a good mom!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Nobody knows your son like you do.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll stop letting my son wear red too.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;What about daughters?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;How old was he when you realized wearing red was the source of all <br/>\n&gt; his <br/>\n&gt; learning problems?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;What about pink?
