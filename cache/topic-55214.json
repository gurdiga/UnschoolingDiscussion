So I<br/>\nwent to the local college  and obtained some A levels and went to university at 20. I think I did better at university because I had decided to go therefore I really worked and enjoyed it too.<br/>\nUniversities seem to welcome mature students and often waive the entrance requirements.

Lots of kids <br/>\ngo through the steps to finish high school and fulfill <br/>\nrequirements and *still* don&#39;t qualify for the grants and <br/>\nscholarships that you are suggesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut lastly, and this is the one that changed everything for me, why <br/>\ndo we put more weight on preparing against a possible desire <br/>\nthan on the pursuit of one that is currently self-evident, allowing <br/>\nfor the possiblity that that very pursuit will be the key to leading a <br/>\nchild where he/she actually wants to go?!<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently a mom on a nother forum where I spend a good deal of <br/>\nmy time talked about her 17 yod who got 1580 on the SATs. This <br/>\ngirl is completely stumped aout what school to pick and where to <br/>\napply. She doesn&#39;t know what she wants to do with her life and <br/>\nis feeling that paralysis that comes before a major decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has optionsmultitudes of them. What she doesn&#39;t ahve is <br/>\nclarity. Yet she is the model public schooled kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many of us knew ourselves well after twelve years in &quot;the <br/>\nsystem&quot;? <br/>\n<br/>\nMy hope is that my kids can use this season of their lives to live <br/>\nto the fullest in a way that satisfies their innate curiosities. And by <br/>\ndoing that, we are trusting that at the appropriate hour, they will <br/>\nsee what it is that will come next.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it turned out that one of our kids said, &quot;Gee, I really did want to <br/>\ngo to Princeton and my form of education won&#39;t convince the <br/>\nadmissions folks that I am qualified, what can I do?&quot; We will go <br/>\nfor it then. We will face that issue then. That seems profoundly <br/>\nlogical to me. <br/>\n<br/>\n(Did you see Rudy?

I <br/>\nlove that these kids didn&#39;t even all want college once they had <br/>\nfound their niche in life. Who knows how our kids will spend their <br/>\nearly adult years?
