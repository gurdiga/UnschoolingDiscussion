He enjoys writing his name in all capitals<br/>\nbut will start with the R small and make each letter progressively<br/>\nbigger.  He says the bigger the letter is the louder it is.  I think<br/>\nthat is really neat.  Of course I have all the paper where they are<br/>\nsuppose to make the letters even but I haven&#39;t introduced that yet.  At<br/>\nsome time I may tell him that I love the way he writes his name but at<br/>\ntimes it might be easier to read if the letters were all the same size.<br/>\nI know he can make them all the same size though because I&#39;ve seen him<br/>\ndo it.  He&#39;s just doing it this way for fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk me how to get paid for what you are already doing for free.
