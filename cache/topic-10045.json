I think this is just<br/>\n&gt; beautiful.<br/>\n&gt; In Brooklyn, New York, Chush is a school that caters to learning<br/>\n&gt; disabled children.  Some children remain in Chush<br/>\n&gt; for their entire school<br/>\n&gt; career, while others can be mainstreamed into conventional schools.<br/>\n&gt; At a Chush fundraising dinner, the father of a Chush<br/>\n&gt; child delivered a speech<br/>\n&gt; that would never be forgotten by all who attended.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  After extolling the school and its dedicated staff, he cried<br/>\n&gt; out, &quot;Where is the perfection in my<br/>\n&gt; son Shaya?  Everything God does is done with perfection.  But my<br/>\n&gt; child cannot understand things as other children do.  My<br/>\n&gt; child cannot remember<br/>\n&gt; facts and figures as other children do.  Where is<br/>\n&gt; God&#39;s perfection?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The audience was shocked by the question, pained by the<br/>\n&gt; father&#39;s anguish and<br/>\n&gt; stilled by the piercing query.  &quot;I believe,&quot; the father<br/>\n&gt; answered, &quot;that when God brings a child like this into the world,<br/>\n&gt; the  perfection that he seeks is<br/>\n&gt; in the way people react to this child.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He then told the following story<br/>\n&gt; about his son Shaya:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One afternoon, Shaya and his father walked past a park where some<br/>\n&gt; boys Shaya knew were playing baseball.  Shaya asked, &quot;Do you think<br/>\n&gt; they will let me play?&quot; Shaya&#39;s father knew that his son was not at<br/>\n&gt; all athletic and that most boys would not want him on their team.<br/>\n&gt; But Shaya&#39;s father understood that if his son was chosen to play it<br/>\n&gt; would give him a comfortable sense of<br/>\n&gt; belonging. Shaya&#39;s father approached one of the boys<br/>\n&gt; in the field and asked if Shaya could play. The boy looked around for<br/>\n&gt; guidance from his teammates.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Getting none, he took matters into his own hands and said &quot;We are<br/>\n&gt; losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning.  I<br/>\n&gt; guess he can be on our<br/>\n&gt; team and we&#39;ll try to put him up to bat in the ninth inning.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shaya&#39;s father was ecstatic as Shaya smiled broadly.  Shaya was told<br/>\n&gt; to put on a glove and<br/>\n&gt; go out to play short center field.  In the bottom of the eighth<br/>\n&gt; inning, Shaya&#39;s team scored a few runs but was still behind<br/>\n&gt; by three. In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shaya&#39;s team scored<br/>\n&gt; again and now with two outs and the bases loaded with the potential<br/>\n&gt; winning run on base.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shaya was scheduled to be up.  Would the team actually let Shaya bat<br/>\n&gt; at this juncture and give away their chance to win the game?<br/>\n&gt; Surpassingly, Shaya<br/>\n&gt; was given the bat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Everyone knew that it was all but impossible because Shaya didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; even know how to hold the bat properly, let alone hit with it.<br/>\n&gt; However as Shaya stepped up to the plate, the pitcher moved a few<br/>\n&gt; steps to lob the ball in softly so Shaya should at least be able to<br/>\n&gt; make contact. The first pitch<br/>\n&gt; came and Shaya swung clumsily and missed.  One of Shaya&#39;s teammates<br/>\n&gt; came up to Shaya and together they held the bat and faced the pitcher<br/>\n&gt; waiting for<br/>\n&gt; the next pitch.  The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss<br/>\n&gt; the ball softly toward Shaya.  As the pitch came in, Shaya and his<br/>\n&gt; teammate swung at the ball and together they hit a slow ground ball<br/>\n&gt; to the pitcher.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could easily have thrown<br/>\n&gt; the ball to the first baseman.  Shaya would have been out and that<br/>\n&gt; would have ended the game.  Instead, the pitcher took the ball and<br/>\n&gt; threw<br/>\n&gt; it on a high arc to right field, far beyond reach of the first<br/>\n&gt; baseman.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Everyone started yelling, &quot;Shaya, run to first.  Run to first.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Never in his life had Shaya<br/>\n&gt; run to first.  He scampered down the baseline wide-eyed and<br/>\n&gt; startled.  By the time he reached first base, the right fielder<br/>\n&gt; had the ball.  He could have thrown he ball to the second baseman who<br/>\n&gt; would tag out Shaya, who was still running.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But the right fielder understood<br/>\n&gt; what the pitcher&#39;s intentions were, so he threw the ball high and far<br/>\n&gt; over the third baseman&#39;s  head.  Everyone yelled, &quot;Run to second, run<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; second.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shaya ran towards second base as the runners ahead of him deliriously<br/>\n&gt; circled the bases<br/>\n&gt; towards home.  As Shaya reached second base, the<br/>\n&gt; opposing short stop ran to<br/>\n&gt; him, turned him in the direction of third base and shouted, &quot;Run to<br/>\n&gt; third.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As Shaya rounded third, the boys from both teams ran<br/>\n&gt; behind him screaming,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Shaya run home.&quot;  Shaya ran home, stepped on home plate and all 18<br/>\n&gt; boys lifted him on their shoulders and made him the hero, as if he<br/>\n&gt; had just hit a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;grand slam&quot; and won the game for his team.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;That day,&quot; said the father softly with tears now rolling down his<br/>\n&gt; face, &quot;those 18 boys reached their level of God&#39;s perfection.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure this will offend some people, but I think it&#39;s funny!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6001/14/_/448294/_/962121370/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6001/14/_/448294/_/962121370/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To Unsubscribe: mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tamilooch@aol.com","from":"Tamilooch@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"vC8MxSrGz72hEQJZsBCvCSz4ba-yoORfNWWr2Wh2GZKJpihNUl5fEEf-QqMDVsJN2ll5V5w9L9o","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Off topic but beautiful","postDate":"962121878","msgId":10049,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRmLjY0OGUwODUuMjY4YTJhOTZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":10045,"nextInTopic":10052,"prevInTime":10048,"nextInTime":10050,"topicId":10045,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Lorrie, I just read your post about Shaya, I am balling.
