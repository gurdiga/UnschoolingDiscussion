And for those hardy souls who manage to get <br/>\nthemselves all the way through the Japanese educational system, there&#39;s <br/>\nno longer even a guarantee they&#39;ll get a job.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen your local media runs news stories on how Japan is the &quot;educational <br/>\nrole model of the world&quot; or some such nonsense, lay a few of these <br/>\nnumbers on &#39;em....<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian Covert<br/>\n(KnoK NEWS)<br/>\nin Osaka, Japan<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[The Japan Times - Saturday, August 5, 2000]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n130,000 in 1999-2000<br/>\nTRUANCY REACHES RECORD HIGH<br/>\n<br/>\nMore than 130,000 elementary and junior high school students were truant <br/>\nfor 30 or more school days during the 1999-2000 academic year, according <br/>\nto an Education Ministry survey released Friday.<br/>\n<br/>\nA total of 130,208 students missed school without permission between <br/>\nApril 1999 and March this year, up about 2,500, or 2 percent, from the <br/>\nprevious academic year and the most since the statistics were first taken <br/>\nin the 1991-1992 year.                                   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe rate of increase in the number of absentees slowed significantly, <br/>\nhowever, from the more than 10 percent rises posted in the three <br/>\nconsecutive years starting with the 1996-1997 year.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The rate of truancy at schools where they have counselors is low,&quot; the <br/>\nministry said.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome 104,000 junior high school students -- up 2.4 percent from the <br/>\n1998-1999 year -- and about 26,000 elementary school students -- an <br/>\nincrease of 0.1 percent -- were found in the survey to have missed 30 or <br/>\nmore school days.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe figures correspond to 2.45 percent of all junior high school students <br/>\nin Japan -- one in every 41 -- meaning roughly one student in each class <br/>\nrefused to attend school. One of the reasons often cited is bullying by <br/>\nother students.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe figure for elementary school students was 0.35 percent, according to <br/>\nthe survey.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, the number of people who neither landed full-time jobs nor <br/>\ncontinued their education after graduating from high school, junior <br/>\ncollege or university increased to about 295,000, due in part to the <br/>\ncontinuing economic recession.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 121,000 graduates from universities, 42,000 from junior colleges <br/>\nand 132,000 from high schools were in this category.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe employment rate of new university graduates dropped 4.3 percentage <br/>\npoints to a record low 55.8 percent, with only 301,000 out of the 539,000 <br/>\ngraduates taking full-time jobs and with many of the remaining students <br/>\ncontinuing on to graduate school.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetween 30 percent and 40 percent of the combined 163,000 university and <br/>\njunior college graduates who neither landed full-time jobs nor continued <br/>\non to graduate school went to vocational schools, indicating a growing <br/>\nnumber of youths are hoping to gain special qualifications to help in <br/>\ntheir search for work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Japan Times<br/>\n(C) All rights reserved</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11853,"nextTopicId":11821}}
