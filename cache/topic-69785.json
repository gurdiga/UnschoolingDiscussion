What I think is being <br/>\nput across as I have understood the posts thus far is that this is <br/>\nnot the best way to handle that type of situation, and others trying <br/>\nto follow a truely unschooling philosophy should not percieve that as <br/>\nthe a good approach and model it.  I beleive that is why certain <br/>\npeople are continuing to argue over that point.  It does not really <br/>\nmatter if it was MEANT one way over another.  Readers do not want <br/>\nsomeone to percieve it as a logical solution and use that tactic with <br/>\ntheir children.  Personally, I would never tell my child &quot;maybe <br/>\ntomorrow&quot; at that age for smoking because I would simply not allow <br/>\nit.  Would you have let your daughter at THAT age smoke a cigarette?  <br/>\nIf not, then your answer was not fair.  If so, then we have a whole <br/>\nother set of issues &lt;g&gt;!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more you argue over that sentence, the more this issue cannot be <br/>\nlaid to rest and the SAME emails will continue.  If you are insistent <br/>\nthat you are correct on this then just agree in your heart to <br/>\ndisagree and move foward.<br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)<br/>\nI am slapping myself for continuing this whole thread.
