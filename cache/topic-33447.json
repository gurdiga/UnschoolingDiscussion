I had to change the title because it is a pet peeve of <br/>\nmine to call young people anything other than that. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis week, we went to Baltimore to the Aquarium. Lelia is into animal <br/>\nbehaviour and interspecies communication. She was able to communicate with <br/>\nthe dolphins, the &quot;regular&quot; fish (her terminology), and a couple of parrots. <br/>\nQuinton really liked the sharks. Lelia is writing some more songs and was <br/>\nfaced with an interesting dilema which we kind of worked our way through with <br/>\neveryone giving opinions (that were asked for) about how they would handle it <br/>\nand how we thought she should. There is a workshop with this pretty <br/>\nincredible songwriter at her unschool resource center. We just found out the <br/>\ndate was the same date she is planned to go to the Bahama&#39;s with an old <br/>\nfriend. Anyway, it got worked out that she would go a couple of days later <br/>\nand she gets to navigate the Miami airport on her own. And she gets to go to <br/>\nthe workshop. She had surgery on her arm one day so her week was kind of <br/>\nmessed up in that regard. But she learned all the lines to her play she is <br/>\nin. And she is watching Moulin Rouge almost everyday. She has almost all the <br/>\nlines of every part memorized as well as imitates the accents pretty well. <br/>\nShe is working on a list of things she would like to accomplish. She is also <br/>\ngoing to volunteer at the zoo and try to do some communicating with the <br/>\nanimals there. And she works with her dog every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuinton discovered a swing in the yard in this really cool circle of trees <br/>\nwith some incredible rocks in it. When we moved in, we didnt go anywhere near <br/>\nit because of the poison ivy. So we are planning on clearing that area out <br/>\nand making a play area for him and fencing that in. He made several new <br/>\nfriends at the park, got lost at the store and went to the deli lady and <br/>\nsaid, &quot;excuse me, I am lost, can you find my mommy&quot; . . . we thought that was <br/>\npretty cool (he is 2 1/2) that he knew to do that. He didnt get too scared <br/>\nand got some cheese (bonus). <br/>\n<br/>\nTomorrow we are going to New York City on the train and seeing the Statue of <br/>\nLiberty, Greenwich Village (Lelia&#39;s choice), and whatever else we fit in. We <br/>\nare spending the night too. And that&#39;s the news from Chester Springs.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving in Abundance<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. Thanks for a new thread Bridget</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33042,"nextTopicId":871}}
