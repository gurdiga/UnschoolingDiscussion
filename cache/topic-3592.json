Homeschooling, in whatever form, should be a joy for both you and your <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\nI had to start my homeschooling journey by schooling at home, I mean with <br/>\nstrict curriculum, ect.  That was to satisfy me, and my dh.  Also, that was <br/>\nmy first experience with any style of homeschooling, and I thought that was <br/>\nwhat you were supposed to do.  WRONG!!! lol.  That lasted about six weeks, <br/>\nthen I started picking my own curriculum.  That lasted about a year and I was <br/>\nready to put the boys in school.  A friend told me about a Relaxed Homescool <br/>\nseminar goin on in some town I don&#39;t remember now, but we took the weekend <br/>\noff and went.  It was wonderful, and since then, this is our sixth year, I do <br/>\nwhat works for our family and am constantly evolving my hs style.

Just <br/>\nlast night my 13 year old said that he didn&#39;t feel like he was doing <br/>\nenough.  Today he has read physics,  American history, Scientific <br/>\nAmerican,  played the <br/>\nguitar,  and designed a desk he wants to build.   In his words just <br/>\nnow as he was reading over my shoulder,  &quot;You shouldn&#39;t even mention <br/>\nthat they should be doing something, because then they force <br/>\nthemselves,  and the whole process of deschooling and returning to a <br/>\nlove of learning takes longer.&quot;  How&#39;s that?  I do think I slowed him <br/>\ndown in the beginning with my own concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy two best recommendation are - <br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Get busy learning yourself and let them see you following your own <br/>\ninterests.<br/>\n2.  READ, READ, READ about unschooling, deschooling, learning styles, <br/>\netc.  There are a lot of resources on the net.  Besides that I like <br/>\nto read Home Ed Mag, Growing without Schooling Mag, _The Unschooling <br/>\nHandbook_by Mary Griffith, and _The Teenage Liberation Handbook_by <br/>\nGrace LLewellyn.  Also,  anything by John Holt.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane from KS<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3608,"nextTopicId":3612}}
