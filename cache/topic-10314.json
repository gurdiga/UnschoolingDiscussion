Continuing will change nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not been rude, defensive, or condescending in any of my messages.<br/>\nAnd no, I do not need any attntion from you.  The tone of your missive is<br/>\nvery patronizing and is not appreciated.  You do not agree with my position,<br/>\nand you are perfectly entitled to to that.  I am afforded that same right, I<br/>\ndo not have to agree with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a very real double standard on this list.  The majority of the<br/>\npeople here do not believe in spanking, and made some very strong statements<br/>\nregarding it, even to calling spanking abusive.  Those statements were not<br/>\ncalled &quot;judgmental&quot; , nor were the posters called names.  Why is it any<br/>\ndifferent to say that parents who spank are abusive than to say that leaving<br/>\nchildren in full time care is harmful?  There is no difference, except in<br/>\nyour perception.  It would appear that what you agree with is okay to say,<br/>\nand what you don&#39;t agree with is judgmental.  That is a very narrow view.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is, and has been, my stand that children are harmed by being abandoned by<br/>\ntheir parents.  I never said the parents were &quot;bad&quot;or &quot;abusive&quot;.  I said it<br/>\nis a wrong action because it harms the children.  I firmly believe that the<br/>\nrights of children supercede the wishes, or even rights, or adults.  If you<br/>\nchoose to disagree with this then so be it.  Your disagreement does not make<br/>\nmy view &quot;judgmental&quot;, it makes it different.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried to be very clear, and have been repeating myself for days here,<br/>\nto no avail.  If you enjoy attacking those who hold different views than<br/>\nyours please attack elsewhere.  If you would like to engage in a discussion<br/>\non the different sides of the issue I would be happy to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nDia Garland</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10310,"nextTopicId":10315}}
