I&#39;m <br/>\nnot complaining - and this is not in response to any particular post or <br/>\nthread or anything like that - but the reminders that people should <br/>\nread a couple of weeks before posting reminded ME that we had intended <br/>\nto send the list policies out at least once in a while to remind <br/>\neverybody what they say.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the list has, in general, been going very very well and I <br/>\nreally appreciate all the great ideas and advice and ESPECIALLY the <br/>\nanalysis and deep thinking about parents and children and learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list has 1,370+ members and that number is growing every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who are new to unschooling and/or to this list, let me assure <br/>\nyou that there will be plenty of opportunity for you to get your <br/>\nquestions answered - topics come and go and come back again. Just make <br/>\nsure you&#39;ve read the posting policies carefully and please only read <br/>\nfor at least a couple of weeks and get used to what this list is like <br/>\nas it may be different than other homeschooling lists you&#39;ve been on.<br/>\n<br/>\n  For those who are not new to the list, please reread the posting <br/>\npolicies I&#39;ve provided below - it has been quite a while since we last <br/>\nposted them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for being here. Thanks for sharing a part of your lives with us. <br/>\nThanks for caring so much about your kids!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolingDiscussion Posting Policies<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is our sincere wish to provide a forum for those seeking to deepen <br/>\ntheir<br/>\nunderstanding of the unschooling philosophy. The primary purpose of this<br/>\nlist is to encourage the critical examination of ideas, beliefs and<br/>\nviewpoints.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestioning of deeply-held ideas and beliefs can be very uncomfortable <br/>\nand<br/>\nsometimes responses to that process can stand in the way of people <br/>\ngetting<br/>\nwhat they need out of the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, we offer the following guidelines to help our members get the<br/>\nmost from the list:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Read for at least a couple of weeks before posting yourself. Spend <br/>\nthat<br/>\ntime getting a &quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members. This will help you<br/>\ndecide if this list is worth your time or whether some other list might <br/>\nbe<br/>\nmore useful to you in meeting your needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n2 Expect your beliefs to be challenged. Welcome this as an opportunity <br/>\nto<br/>\ncritically examine your own ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. When differences of opinion arise, stick to discussing ideas, not the<br/>\nperson with whom you are disagreeing.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. If you have a belief or practice that you don&#39;t want held up to <br/>\npublic<br/>\nexamination, don&#39;t post it to the list.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Before you hit &quot;send,&quot; consider whether your post will contribute<br/>\npositively to the unschooling discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Avoid using loaded terminology. For instance, &quot;If you have no TV<br/>\nrestrictions why don&#39;t your kids just watch TV all day?&quot; will get you <br/>\nmore<br/>\nuseful responses than, &quot;I don&#39;t see how your kids learn anything if all <br/>\nthey<br/>\never do is sit around like zombies watching unlimited TV.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n7. It is not useful to inform the list that you believe someone else is<br/>\nbeing rude or discourteous; please trust the rest of the list to <br/>\nrecognize<br/>\nrudeness for themselves. Saying, &quot;Jane was rude to me,&quot; just bogs down <br/>\nthe<br/>\nlist. It is also a waste of everyone&#39;s time when participants attempt to<br/>\ncorrect or improve other list members&#39; manners. It never works and <br/>\nalways<br/>\ndisrupts the list. Avoid<br/>\nstatements such as: &quot;Jane, here is my suggestion of how you could write <br/>\nmore<br/>\nnicely so people wouldn&#39;t think you are being rude.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Our brains automatically supply a &quot;tone&quot; to posts as we read. It can <br/>\nbe<br/>\nhelpful to imagine your best friend speaking the words you are reading, <br/>\nin<br/>\nthe gentlest, most well-meaning tone you can imagine. It is <br/>\nunacceptable to<br/>\nattack the &quot;tone&quot; of the list or to make generalizations about it. &quot;I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen on many other lists and this one is the rudest I&#39;ve seen,&quot; would be<br/>\nunacceptable. Instead, attempt to create a positive, helpful tone with <br/>\nyour<br/>\nown posts by setting the example you hope others will follow.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Envision every post and response as a dish at a potluck dinner. You <br/>\nwon&#39;t<br/>\nlove every dish at a potluck any more than you will love every poster&#39;s<br/>\nstyle of help. But a dish/post may be exactly what someone else needs. <br/>\nIf<br/>\nyou don&#39;t like a certain list member&#39;s offerings, skip them and<br/>\nleave them for others.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. Read and write as clearly as you can. In casual conversation we <br/>\noften<br/>\ndon&#39;t realize how much we rely on others to fill in the gist of our<br/>\nconversation based on what they expect us to say. But here, without body<br/>\nlanguage or inflection, all we have to go on are your words and they <br/>\nshould<br/>\nsay what you mean. If you say, for example, you &quot;never&quot; do something, it<br/>\nshould not mean &quot;almost never.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOur goal is to make the list as useful as possible for those seeking to<br/>\ndeepen their understanding of the unschooling philosophy. To do that, <br/>\nall<br/>\nnew list members are initially moderated to prevent spamming and catch <br/>\nposts<br/>\nthat could disrupt the list. People will also be moderated if they <br/>\ndisrupt<br/>\nthe usefulness of the list. Potentially disruptive posts will be <br/>\nreturned<br/>\nfor revision.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have questions, please write to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingdiscussion-owner@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingdiscussion-owner@yahoogroups.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] This list","postDate":"1064093135","msgId":81043,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2Mi4yNWRiNzg5Ni4yYzllMWZjZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53149,"nextInTopic":88194,"prevInTime":81042,"nextInTime":81044,"topicId":21781,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/20/2003 4:47:44 PM Eastern Daylight Time, UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com writes: I m really so sad that Judie felt so attacked","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1023562761\">In a message dated 9/20/2003 4:47:44 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\nI&#39;m really so sad that Judie felt so attacked about her own belief system<br/>\nthat she had to leave this list... and it&#39;s an unschooling support list at<br/>\nthat!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, no.

There is a wide variety of viewpoints on many issues like television, <br/>\nwhat unschooling is, controls, etc. If we can keep discsussing these issues <br/>\nin a respectful way, even though we may totally disagree, I think things will <br/>\nsmooth out.

I wrote to people privately, but when it was the most <br/>\ndangerous here I was afraid to thank people publicly for fear they would be <br/>\ninsulted.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife shouldn&#39;t be that way, and public thanks should receive public <br/>\nacknowledgement, and so I apologize for wimping out to the extent I did <br/>\n(going private), and I hope those affected understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this list *because* it is specifically for unschoolers and because <br/>\nit&#39;s a part of the unschooling forum I am SO glad exists.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor years, print media (GWS, HEM on paper) and John Holt books were the best <br/>\nunschoolers could do for help.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen for many more years unschoolers participated in online lists and message <br/>\nboards alongside structured homeschoolers who pretty regularly proclaimed we <br/>\nwere not only ruining our kids, but endangering homeschooling rights for <br/>\neverybody (AND we weren&#39;t helping bring up test scores, which was the goal of <br/>\nmany of the most conservative--get those test scores up so nobody will look <br/>\nat what they weren&#39;t even beginning to teach in social studies requirements). <br/>\n We had to endure *daily* suggestions that a curriculum would probably be <br/>\nbetter than just &quot;trusting&quot; that we might find educational experiences.  We <br/>\nhad to endure serious suggestions that homeschoolers should stay quietly in <br/>\ntheir homes during &quot;school hours&quot; for the good of all homeschoolers.  We had <br/>\nto answer the Same Dumb Questions constantly and in public:  How will they <br/>\nlearn to read?  How will they learn times tables?  How will they learn to <br/>\nstudy?  How will they learn discipline and obedience?  How will they learn <br/>\nanything the mother doesn&#39;t know?<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily for those who have only begun unschooling in the past three years or <br/>\nso, those stories are now the quaint and distant past.  It is rare now that <br/>\nsomeone comes in not knowing at all what unschooling is, or insisting that <br/>\nrequiring math lessons doesn&#39;t keep them from being unschoolers.  What was <br/>\nconstant for some of us is rare-to-never for newer participants, and so that <br/>\nmight be why some of the old timers are less patient than some newe <br/>\nparticipants thought we would be.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of us remember times when there weren&#39;t separate forums.  Now there are. <br/>\n There are now &quot;safe&quot; places for fundamentalist Christian curriculum users <br/>\nwhere they can pretend none of us exist (or revile us without response).  <br/>\nThere is a sweet, good place for Christian unschoolers to discuss unschooling <br/>\nwithout non-Christian influences and suggestions.  There are still lots of <br/>\n&quot;mixed&quot; group discussions and lists.  And then there are very few purely <br/>\nunschooling places.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone claimed there were several others.
