Around 36,000,000 boxes of chocolates will be given as gifts today.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe holiday comes, in part, from the Romans&#39; holiday honoring Juno, the goddess of women and marriage, on the night before the Feast of Lupercalia. Roman girls would put slips of paper with their names on them into a clay jar, and the boys would choose their partner for the festival by taking a slip from the jar. This was one of the few times girls and boys were allowed to socialize, and the dancing and games often evolved into courtship and marriage.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTradition has it that Valentine&#39;s Day as we know it began sometime in the middle of the third century. Claudius II of Rome was waging several wars and needed to recruit more soldiers for his armies. He thought that many men were reluctant to join because they didn&#39;t want to leave their wives and families, and so he temporarily banned engagements and marriages.  O foolish Claudius!  Saint Valentine was working as a priest at the time and he and his partner Saint Marius broke the law and secretly married couples. Eventually Saint Valentine was caught and sentenced to death. While awaiting his punishment he would talk with the young daughter of the prison guard whose father allowed her to visit occasionally. Saint Valentine was killed on February 14, 269 A.D., but he had left a note for the guard&#39;s daughter, signed, &quot;Love from your Valentine.&quot;  This all sounds like made up history - but there you have it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223130287,"authorName":"Krisula Moyer","from":"&quot;Krisula Moyer&quot; &lt;krisula@...&gt;","profile":"krisulaula","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"7"},"subject":"RE: Today&#39;s questions","postDate":"1139961311","msgId":112062,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwMjE0MjM1NS5rMUVOdEFyMjAwOTQzNEBtcy1zbXRwLTAzLWVyaTAuc29jYWwucnIuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMzk5MzkxMTIuMTMyODkuNTU1MjUubTM0QHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":112059,"nextInTopic":112067,"prevInTime":112061,"nextInTime":112063,"topicId":112030,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Why do people give cards on Valentine s day?
