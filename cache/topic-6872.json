Basically, it used to be a Anti-Virus golden rule that you were safe to open Email as you could only be infected by opening the attachment. BubbleBoy, and now Wscript.Kak, have changed this as they are able to infect some PCs without the user opening the E-mail attachment. <br/>\n<br/>\nWscript.Kak is the second family of viruses to exploit a weakness in Internet Explorer 5.0 when it is installed onto a machine that is running Windows98. Those PCs that have Internet Explorer security settings set to medium or low can be automatically infected when the E-mail message is read. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the message is opened, Wscript.Kak will store a copy of its worm code in the Windows statup directory in a file called &quot;Kak.HTA&quot;. The worm will also write part of the worm code to a file called &quot;Kak.HTM&quot; in the system directory and creates the following registry key to ensure that it will be automatically loaded every time the PC is restarted. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe registry key is: &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&#92;Software&#92;Microsoft&#92;Windows&#92;CurrentVersion&#92;Run&#92;cAgOu&quot;] <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the worm is installed it will search to see if the user has set up different identities that can be used under Outlook Express 5.0. If they are found the worm will begin attaching a copy of itself to ALL the E-mails that are sent out by the user. <br/>\n<br/>\nPayload: When the worm is activated, it checks the system date and will display the following message at 5 PM on the first of any month. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kagou-Anti-Kro$oft says not today !&quot; <br/>\nThe worm then attempts to shut down Windows. <br/>\nThere are no deliberately destructive payloads in this virus. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[This message contained attachments]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6865,"nextTopicId":6875}}
