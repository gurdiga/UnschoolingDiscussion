The goal is to get to 11 but not over. Dealer gives one card, <br/>\nface down, to each player including dealer. Then dealer gives one card, <br/>\nface up, to each player, including dealer. Players look at their face <br/>\ndown card, but don&#39;t reveal it to others. First player tells dealer <br/>\n&quot;hit me&quot; if he wants another card. Dealer gives him another card, face <br/>\nup. Player says, &quot;I&#39;ll stay,&quot; if he doesn&#39;t want another card. Then <br/>\ndealer goes to next player and last to himself. Players that go over 11 <br/>\nlose. Whoever gets closest to 11 or exactly 11 wins that hand. We have <br/>\nthe winner of that hand keep all the cards (split them if there is a <br/>\ntie) and change dealers for each hand. When the deck is gone, player <br/>\nwith the most cards wins.<br/>\n<br/>\nMove up to 21 when the kid is comfortable adding that high. After you <br/>\nplay it a while, you can make the Aces count as either ones or elevens. <br/>\nThen, if they are dealt two of the same number, they can turn both face <br/>\nup and get two new face down cards and play two hands at once. Just <br/>\nsome variations based on BlackJack - make up your own, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetting with pennies or toothpicks or jelly beans or M&Ms is fun to add <br/>\nto this game, too. Everybody put in a penny ante (before dealing). Then <br/>\nwhen the face down and one face up card has been dealt, everybody can <br/>\ngo around putting in a bet and raising and all that.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can play this with just two people or more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*********************<br/>\n<br/>\nA fun variation of &quot;War&quot; is &quot;Persian Pasha.&quot;<br/>\n2 players<br/>\nHalf of the deck to each player.<br/>\nEach player puts down a card, face up, simultaneously (like in War). <br/>\nKeep doing that - don&#39;t worry about the numbers on the cards - same or <br/>\ndifferent doesn&#39;t matter until the two cards put down are the same <br/>\nsuit, THEN the higher card wins and that player takes ALL the cards <br/>\nplayed so far.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122053797,"authorName":"Melanie Freisinger deGonzalez","from":"Melanie Freisinger deGonzalez &lt;gonzalezpalace5@...&gt;","profile":"gpalace47","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] unschooling math","postDate":"1071338910","msgId":86181,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMxMjEzMTgwODMwLjIxNTg2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjgwNDA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUxLjM4OWYxMDM3LjJkMGM5Y2RlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":86173,"nextInTopic":86182,"prevInTime":86180,"nextInTime":86182,"topicId":5500,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"anyone play Dutch Blitz? melanie SandraDodd@aol.com wrote: In a message dated 12/13/03 6:34:52 AM, jcurtielectric@msn.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-978603638\">anyone play Dutch Blitz?<br/>\n <br/>\nmelanie<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 12/13/03 6:34:52 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcurtielectric@...\">jcurtielectric@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I alwyas knew the answer but I always <br/>\n<br/>\ngot confused about which sign to use. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one of the few math signs that makes logical sense, or picture-sense. <br/>\n2&lt;3<br/>\n<br/>\nThe smaller end of the mark is by the smaller number.
