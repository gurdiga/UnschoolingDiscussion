In his book Travels Through America, first published in<br/>\nEsquire Magazine, Feb 76, Harrison Salisbury described his efforts to trace<br/>\nthe Westward path of some of his ancestors. He describes one of them thus:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;. He (Hiram Salisbury) was a man of his time (1815). I scan the journal for<br/>\nclues and reconstruct the post-Revolutionary American. I list his skills,<br/>\none sheet of scratch paper after another.  He knew every farm chore.  He<br/>\nmilked cows and attended the calves in birth.  He physicked his horse.  He<br/>\nplowed, he planted, he cultivated, hayed, picked apples, grafted fruit<br/>\ntrees, cut wheat with a scythe, cradled oats, threshed grain with a flail on<br/>\na clay floor. He chopped the corn and put down his vegetables for winter.<br/>\nHe made cider and built cider mills. He made cheese and fashioned cheese<br/>\ntongs. He butchered the hogs and sheared the sheep.  He churned butter and<br/>\nsalted it. He made soap and candles, thatched barns and built smokehouses.<br/>\nHe butchered oxen and constructed ox sledges. He fought forest fires and<br/>\nmarked out the land. He repaired the crane at Smith&#39;s mill and forged a<br/>\ncrane for his own fireplace to hang the kettle on. He collected iron in the<br/>\ncountryside and smelted it. He tapped (mended) his children&#39;s shoes and his<br/>\nown. He built trundle beds, oxcarts, sleighs, and wagons, wagon wheels and<br/>\nwheel spokes. He turned logs into boards and cut locust wood for picket<br/>\nfences. He made house frames, beams, mortised and pegged. With six men&#39;s<br/>\nhelp he raised the frames and built the houses. He made a neat cherry stand<br/>\nwith a drawer for a cousin, fixed clocks and went fishing.  He carved his<br/>\nown board measures (yardsticks) and sold them for a dollar apiece. He fitted<br/>\nwindow cases, mended locks, and fixed compasses. He hewed timber, surveyed<br/>\nthe forest, wrote deeds and shave shingles.  He inspected the town records<br/>\nand audited the books of the Friendship Lodge, the oldest freshwater Masonic<br/>\nlodge in the country (still running).  He chipped plows, constructed carding<br/>\nmachines, carved gunstocks and built looms.  He set gravestones and<br/>\nfashioned wagon hubs.  He ran a bookstore and could make a fine coffin in<br/>\nhalf a day.  He was a member of the state&#39;s General Assembly, overseer of<br/>\nthe poor, appraiser of property and fellow of the town council.  He made<br/>\nhoops by the thousands and also pewter faucets.  For many years he collected<br/>\nthe town taxes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not listed all of Hiram&#39;s skills but enough.  I do not think he was<br/>\nan unusual man. Put me in Hiram&#39;s wold and I would not last long.  Put Hiram<br/>\ndown in our world, He might have a little trouble with a computer, but he&#39;d<br/>\nget the hang of it faster than I could cradle a bushel of oats.<br/>\n<br/>\n    ******<br/>\nJohn Holt  - I tend to agree with Harrison Salisbury that Hiram, though<br/>\nperhaps not an unusual man in his time, would be a most unusual one in ours,<br/>\nfor more knowing, skillful, intelligent, resourceful, adaptive, inventive,<br/>\nand competent than most people we could find today, in either city or<br/>\ncountry, and no matter how schooled.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the real question that I want to raise, and answer, is how Hiram learned<br/>\nall those skills. To be sure, he did not learn them in school. Nor did he<br/>\nlearn them in workshops or any other school-like activity.  Almost<br/>\ncertainly, he learned how to do all those kinds of work, many of them highly<br/>\nskilled, by being around when other people were doing them.  Nor were these<br/>\nother people doing the work in order to teach Hiram something. Nobody raised<br/>\na barn just so that Hiram could see how barns were raised. They raised it<br/>\nbecause they need the barn. Nor did they say to him, &quot;Hiram as long as I<br/>\nhave to raise this barn, you may as well come around and learn how it is<br/>\ndone.  &quot;&quot;They said, &quot;Hiram, I&#39;m raising a barn and I need your help&quot;.  He<br/>\nwas there to help, not to learn --but as he helped, he learned.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost a century later John Dewey was to talk about &quot;learning by doing.&quot;<br/>\nThe way for students to learn (for example) how pottery is made is not read<br/>\nabout it in a book but to make pots.  Well, OK, no doubt about its being<br/>\nbetter. But making pots just to learn to how it is done still doesn&#39;t seem<br/>\nto me anywhere near as good as making pots (and learning from it) because<br/>\nsomeone needs the pots.  The incentive to learn how to do good work, and to<br/>\ndo it, is surely much greater when you know that the work has to be done,<br/>\nthat it is going to be of real use to someone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nPoetic License<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.poeticlicense.org/\">http://www.poeticlicense.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCarol had this to say about the review copy of the Poetic License video:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When I sat down to watch, I didn&#39;t imagine I would witness<br/>\nsuch a powerful, heart-rending portrayal of kids reading their own<br/>\nwords at poetry slams across the country. I was moved to tears and<br/>\nhad to turn it off to catch my breath several times. The raw emotions<br/>\nand deeply insightful poetry of dozens teens from diverse communities<br/>\nsimply overwhelmed me. The sight of these kids taking over the<br/>\nNational Poetry Competition and refusing to compete under time<br/>\nlimits, instead supporting each other and cheering for each other so<br/>\neverybody won, still brings tears to my eyes. This is a film about<br/>\nsome incredibly talented and caring young people (one of them a<br/>\nhomeschooler Megan Cohen)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nProduced and directed by David Yanofsky, Poetic License showcases the<br/>\nvibrant and compelling voices of American youth.   Along with the video<br/>\nthere will be future curriculum materials with a study guide, a 150-page<br/>\nteacher&#39;s guide (to be published by Heinemann Press in fall 2001), and a<br/>\nwebsite where teachers and teens can share their work and passion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nApril is National Poetry month and PBS will be airing the video across the<br/>\nnation, please check the website for times in your area.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nYour children are not your children.<br/>\nThey are the sons and daughters of Life&#39;s longing for itself.<br/>\nThey come through you but not from you,<br/>\nAnd though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.<br/>\nYou may give them your love but not your thoughts.<br/>\nFor they have their own thoughts.<br/>\nYou may house their bodies but not their souls,<br/>\nFor their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,<br/>\nwhich you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.<br/>\nYou may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.<br/>\nFor life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.<br/>\nYou are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.<br/>\nThe archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you<br/>\nwith His might that His arrows may go swift and far.<br/>\nLet your bending in the archer&#39;s hand be for gladness;<br/>\nFor even as he loves the arrow that flies,<br/>\nso He loves also the bow that is stable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKhalil Gibran, from the Prophet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nSet<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.setgame.com/set/puzzle_frame.htm\">http://www.setgame.com/set/puzzle_frame.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhile looking for a few math/logic websites I ran into an old favorite.<br/>\nSet, the card game, is great fun despite being good for the brain.  The<br/>\nwebsite turned out to be very cool.  Each day they lay out 9 cards and you<br/>\nmake the sets online.  Once you find all the sets the computer records them<br/>\nand your time and then enters you into a drawing for a deck of Five Crowns<br/>\n(another wonderful card game) They lay out the cards so there are 6<br/>\ndifferent sets on the screen.  It&#39;s HARD!  Especially if you are used to<br/>\nyelling &quot;set&quot; and raking up the cards, thus shifting the visual aspect. Here<br/>\nthe 9 cards stay put.  So, if you&#39;re looking for 10 minutes or so of logic<br/>\nevery day, bookmark this page.  Just don&#39;t tell the kids, they&#39;ll probably<br/>\nbeat you!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also download a Shareware version of the game for the computer.  I<br/>\nshowed much restraint and did not add this to my collection of games. If I<br/>\nhad, I would not have finished this newsletter!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nPurdue OWL News<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://owl.english.purdue.edu\">http://owl.english.purdue.edu</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOWL stands for Online Writing Lab, and while this is not the most visually<br/>\nappealing site, it is very useful to those interested  in writing.  There<br/>\nare Hypertext and Powerpoint slide shows for those of us who are visual<br/>\nlearners.  The information is sometimes very basic, but still worthwhile.<br/>\nThere are sections for spelling, punctuation, creating bibliographies.

However, I&#39;m uncomfortably<br/>\naware that I&#39;m nervous.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a homeschooling parent has meant being &quot;different.&quot; There has been no<br/>\nformula for us to follow and no prescribed set of goals and achievements to<br/>\nmark the way. While I do it because it feels right, there are times when I<br/>\nenvy the parents who unquestioningly accept the School Education Plan. How<br/>\nnice it must be to adhere to the Program and march right along, complaining<br/>\nsometimes, but basically feeling secure that following someone else&#39;s script<br/>\nis the right thing to do. How reassuring to have someone else lay out the<br/>\nrules - car pool her to preschool, be a first grade class mother, help her<br/>\nwith her homework, join the P. T. A., sign up for Operation Graduation and<br/>\ndrive her to college, and your child will be a success. How unsettling it is<br/>\nsometimes when I think that we have scoffed at the script and now we have to<br/>\ntake responsibility for how it all turns out. If we&#39;d done what was expected<br/>\nof us, nothing would ever be our fault. Right?<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course my husband and I don&#39;t believe that, but I can&#39;t help worrying.<br/>\nThe standard good-parent line is, &quot;All I want is for my child to be happy.&quot;<br/>\nThat&#39;s easy to say when the kids are little, but what about a<br/>\ntwenty-one-year-old daughter who is not on the college track? When I was her<br/>\nage I didn&#39;t even know anyone who wasn&#39;t college track. I realize that if<br/>\nshe had started some business and was making a hundred grand a year I&#39;d be<br/>\nbasking in my know-it-all-homeschooling-mother smugness and who&#39;d care about<br/>\ncollege. The fact that she&#39;s not completely supporting herself at twenty-one<br/>\nis not so unusual, but I worry. Will she ever find enjoyable work that will<br/>\nmake her economically independent? What if she can&#39;t make enough money to be<br/>\nhappy? What if a childhood of following her rhythms leads my daughter to a<br/>\nlifetime of dissatisfaction with boring jobs? What if she just settles into<br/>\nbeing a housewife out of default?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll need to visit this month&#39;s issue of Home Education Magazine for the<br/>\nrest of the article.

While reading a magazine by candle light, I contemplated how<br/>\nutterly ridiculous it was for me to be the editor of anything, given that I<br/>\ncannot spell well nor use commas correctly.  Then I ran accross this by Ann<br/>\nKreilkamp:<br/>\n<br/>\nBack in 1966, when I was a first year graduate student in philosophy, I took<br/>\na course in something called &quot;Formal Logic.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was 23 years old, a &quot;good girl,&quot; outwardly following the rules of society.<br/>\nInwardly, however I was beginning to hold the system at arm&#39;s length.  The<br/>\nrules of logic bored me.  They felt arbitrary and suffocating.  Not that I<br/>\nwas aware of this feeling.  The &quot;proof&quot; of it came during class one day when<br/>\nall of a sudden I no longer could sit silently, squirming.  I raised my<br/>\nhand.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yes?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What&#39;s wrong with contradiction?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(The rules of logic are one long continuous avoidance of contradiction.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe teacher&#39;s mouth fell open, and he just stood there staring at me. Time<br/>\nslowed down.  I watched his face turn beet red.  Finally, he sputtered,<br/>\nfuming: &quot;From a contradiction anything follows, ANYTHING!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there you have it. Unschooling, along with my title of editor, is a<br/>\n&#39;logical contradiction&#39; where anything and everything can follow!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you enjoyed this month&#39;s newsletter.
