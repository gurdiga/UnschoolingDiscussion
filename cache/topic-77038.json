It is such an incredible <br/>\njourney to see all three of us growing ~ we&#39;re experiencing a soulful growthspurt!! <br/>\n I look back at myself 2.5 years ago, my life spiraled out of control, I <br/>\nlooked to the one thing I *could* control ~ I mistakenly thought it was my <br/>\nchildren.  To see them regain faith in themselves (they put themselves to bed, when <br/>\nthey were tired, for the very first time tonight ~ it&#39;s been a *let&#39;s stay up <br/>\nas late as we possibly can-fest* that I trusted would lose it&#39;s intrigue and <br/>\nbalance out ~ it has!) and faith in myself as the perfect guide on this leg of <br/>\nlife&#39;s journey.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis quote just popped into my inbox, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s no accident: <br/>\n&quot;As long as you keep a person down, some part of you has to be down there to <br/>\nhold him down, so it means you cannot soar as you otherwise might.&quot;<br/>\n-- Marian Anderson<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Pam, Thanks for starting that new loop, I couldn&#39;t sign up yet but I will <br/>\nbe there tomorrow (later today, my goodness!).  I&#39;m glad to bring this <br/>\nenlightening conversation to it&#39;s rightful home, I hope some of the never-spanked <br/>\ngenre will join us, enlighten us on peaceful resolution and guide us thru our <br/>\nnot-so-peaceful moments without violence of any kind.  <br/>\n    <br/>\nAnd the rest of you who cherish the integrity of your children&#39;s faith in you <br/>\n~ I&#39;m glad to be here with you, I know it&#39;s the right place!  <br/>\n<br/>\n diana,<br/>\nThe wackiest widow westriver...<br/>\nâ€œRelationships are a prerequisite for producing results beyond ourselves. <br/>\nThey expand our imaginations to infinite possibilities that cannot exist in a <br/>\nlife of isolation.&quot;    --Brian Koslow<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19124,"nextTopicId":76892}}
