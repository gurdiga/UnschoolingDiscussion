Generally after the kids play with something, we pick it up<br/>\n(unless it&#39;s an ongoing project or game of some sort). I think the key<br/>\nthough (as with any discipline) is modeling and repetition. So when we&#39;re<br/>\ndone with breakfast dishes, the kids bring their dishes to the sink and then<br/>\nthey know that I&#39;m not available for play or anything else until I&#39;ve picked<br/>\nup everything from making breakfast. When the kitchen is nice and clean, I&#39;m<br/>\navailable to do activities with them again. Same with everything we do - if<br/>\nwe take a bath, we don&#39;t move on until the towels are picked up and the tub<br/>\nmopped up, if I get my photos and albums out, I don&#39;t do anything else until<br/>\nI&#39;ve picked them up. Of course, with very young kids as I have, I have to be<br/>\nflexible with this - if a crisis comes up, I have to stop what I&#39;m doing and<br/>\ntake care of things. But then before I go on to a different activity I pick<br/>\nup after myself. I can&#39;t ask anything of the kids that I can&#39;t do myself.<br/>\nAnd also of course the repetition - I often have to state things many times<br/>\n(&quot;we need to pick up this game before we go to the park&quot;), and for us at<br/>\nthis age I help them out almost always or turn it into a game or come up<br/>\nwith a song. &quot;Many hands make happy work&quot; is our mantra :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple areas of the house that are &quot;messy zones&quot; - our misc.<br/>\ncraft drawer, the kids bedroom (most of the time :-) - and those we just<br/>\ndon&#39;t worry about.

Several things are possible even in a messy house.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  If you know they do not take care of such things, limit the amount of toys and games and puzzles they may have that have parts to get lost.  If they cannot take care of things that are &quot;age appropriate&quot;  I would simply tell them, &quot;No, you may not have another set of train tracks, since you are apparently too young to care for them properly.  We will try again when you are older and more responsible, or can pay for them yourself.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  In my house, if they leave a big mess and will not clean it up, I get to keep the toy(s) for at least a day, or more.  You don&#39;t care for it, you lose it.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  If they break, destroy, lose and otherwise make useless a toy, I am not buying another one.  Again, if you do not care for it, you lose it.  It is not a necessity for life, and you will not die if you do not have a full set of transformers or a Monopoly game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for remotes, glasses, etc.  There are ways to keep track of those without becoming a master of organization.  Have the glasses wearer don some of those holders that you wear around your neck.  If they are reading glasses and not used constantly, have a dish/drawer/shelf where they go and get into the habit of putting them there whenever they are not in use.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe same advice works for remotes.  We have one for the stereo, one for the VCR and one for the tv, and they all were getting lost constantly.  Then I got hold of a paperboard container for them and stuck it in the entertainment center.  They always go there when they are not in someone&#39;s hand.  No more remote searches in our house.  Simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if it is a constant mess and they are always losing things and making them useless, it would stand to reason that they should run out of things to lose sooner or later.  Let them.  Don&#39;t replace them.  If they complain that they do not have this or that, I would say &quot;Yes, I noticed that too, I have not been stepping on them.  It has been so nice&quot;  or something to that effect.  Simplify, and get rid of the stuff that no one seems to want to care for.  You really do not need a thousand tools and doodads for kids to learn from.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Annette Naake","from":"&quot;Annette Naake&quot; &lt;naake1999@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"uCiRMsqNx-W-uQrR3eup8SHT8m9_P8V5EboT8i2yRS6sYFImJdhk9zIqOP06Maqji1kDe-kqwWGp8iNPCXnZQqziWmP7lci0sn4A75Pq","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"messy vs. disorganized","postDate":"980914943","msgId":15545,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PExBVzItRjE1NUtXaUd0WHNMMWMwMDAwMDUwN0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15557,"prevInTime":15544,"nextInTime":15546,"topicId":15545,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My house is a mess most of the time, which I wouldn t really care about, except it seems we lose stuff in the mess, and then other stuff becomes useless.

All you have to lose is one or <br/>\ntwo things out of a game and it becomes a lot less fun, if not impossible, <br/>\nto play. The pieces get scattered around then the games are no good. This is <br/>\nthe downside of a messy house as far as I&#39;m concerned. (We also lose bigger <br/>\nthings like books, reading glasses, remote controls and toys, but at least <br/>\nthey seem to show up eventually.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps other people are better than I am at getting their kids to put away <br/>\ntheir games when they decide to do something else (&quot;when they are finished <br/>\nwith them&quot; would be misleading, since they&#39;re always quitting halfway <br/>\nthrough and running off without a glance backward). You would think that <br/>\nafter having puzzles, games, models and other items with small pieces <br/>\nrendered unusable because parts had been lost, that they&#39;d be more <br/>\nconscientious, but nooooo.
