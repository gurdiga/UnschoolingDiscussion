Don&#39;t pull them because where you pull one, several more will come up.  That apparently is not true, because every year I&#39;ve had fewer and fewer.  The trick is to grab the plant just above the dirt and pull slowly so as to get all or most of the tap root out.  It is easisest when the plant is smaller and is not an unpleasant task if the weather is not too hot.  It is rather satisfying when the entire root comes up in once piece.  With larger plants, it helps to use a garden fork or spade to loosen the soil.  Tumbleweed seedlings are quite easy to identify because of the red coloring.  As Sandra Dodd wrote, &quot;Most of that red stem/root was under the ground, but as they grow the stem is red at first, when they do start stretching up. There&#39;s nothing the least bit red later on.&quot;  Sandra Dodd, &quot;Tumbleweeds,&quot; n.d., &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/tumbleweeds\">http://sandradodd.com/tumbleweeds</a>&gt; (2 May 2005) <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to cite my reference properly this time. &lt;G&gt;  I referred to this webpage: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/history/benjamin/content/page74.htm\">http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/history/benjamin/content/page74.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nToday is the first day that I wondered how to footnote a webpage.

The previous owners had planted morning glories there  before <br/>\nand I couldn&#39;t stop them from growing up around my tomatoes and my  cucumbers.  <br/>\nI finally just gave up and put some tomato cages near them so  they could <br/>\nclimb.
