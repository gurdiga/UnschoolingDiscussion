I have a son who had <br/>\nnever played a single team sport until he joined lacrosse as a 15 year old (a high school <br/>\nteam, no less). He had never played lacrosse and had never even played soccer or hockey <br/>\nor any sport resembling it. He was an indoor rock climber. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHis first year was challenging, but he scored a goal and his second year, he was as good as <br/>\nmost of the team. It shocked me that he could learn a totally new sport at that age after all <br/>\nthe other guys had played sports their entire lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe did the same thing with piano. He started at age 12 and by 13 was as good as the rest <br/>\nof the 13 year olds.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy next son started soccer this year for the first time. Soccer! These kids have been <br/>\nplaying since age six. Guess what? He&#39;s fine. He&#39;s not the best, but he&#39;s right in there.

With tennis, I actually had an advantage over <br/>\nmy friends who had been playing a long time: I&#39;d watched tennis so <br/>\nmuch on tv that I knew what I should be doing.

Fortunately for our <br/>\nfriendships, my aim wasn&#39;t great so I&#39;d miss a lot, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also joined a swim team when I was about 13. I had no problem with <br/>\nthe swimming, but there were social aspects that were harder to pick <br/>\nup. It did not help that most of the kids&#39; moms were at home while <br/>\nmine were at work and that most of their families had known each <br/>\nother for years. When they needed a ride to a meet, they knew who to <br/>\nask, whereas I was kind of lost. Kids aren&#39;t necessarily good at <br/>\nanswering questions, so without a parent asking the other parents how <br/>\nstuff worked, I was often confused! <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that could be avoided if your son goes into it knowing <br/>\nthere&#39;s more to learn about being on a team than just the sport.<br/>\n<br/>\n--aj</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9206405,"authorName":"jimpetersonl","from":"&quot;jimpetersonl&quot; &lt;jimpetersonl@...&gt;","profile":"jimpetersonl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Thanks!!

I have seen my son GRADUALLY talking to others more and more. Used to <br/>\nbe that when anyone said hi or asked him a question, he would just hide his <br/>\nface or look at me. I encouraged him to answer, but ultimately answered for <br/>\nhim. Sometimes people would say to him &quot;Are you being shy?&quot; and I would <br/>\nimmediately dispel that because I don&#39;t want him thinking of himself as <br/>\n&quot;shy.&quot; Lately (last few months) he has started cautiously answering <br/>\npeople&#39;s questions and having conversations with people we see in our <br/>\nhomeschool group, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My mom and dad are so overly concerned that he is not with other <br/>\n&gt;people.  &quot;he really needs to be away from you some of the time, this is <br/>\n&gt;not normal or healthy for him to be so dependent on you.&quot;  Blah, blah blah.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly.
