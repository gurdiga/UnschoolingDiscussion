We have just begun our unschooling journey this<br/>\nyear <br/>\nafter burning out on three years of traditional homeschool.  I know <br/>\nsome of you would say I&#39;m not a &quot;true&quot; unschooler due to the fact<br/>\nthat <br/>\nI just can&#39;t seem to let go of the math and language texts (ABeka).  <br/>\nI&#39;ve let everything else fall to the wayside, but these are the two <br/>\nthat concern me the most (call me uptight!).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is in getting my ds to complete the given assignment <br/>\nwithin a proper time frame.  He will literally take all day to do one <br/>\nlesson in each (and he&#39;s not struggling, either....just extremely <br/>\nunmotivated).  I have definitely noticed this in other areas of his <br/>\nlife too.....when told to tidy the kitchen, load/unload the <br/>\ndishwasher, etc. it can literally take him HOURS!  He drives me<br/>\ncrazy! <br/>\nThe only time he will really hustle is if he knows he&#39;s going to miss <br/>\nsomething if he doesn&#39;t complete his work, and even then it&#39;s a <br/>\nstruggle.  He is a great kid, very intelligent, but has this lazy, <br/>\nunmotivated streak.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know some of you are going to tell me to throw the ABeka out the <br/>\nwindow (believe me I&#39;ve wanted to at times) but I don&#39;t think I can<br/>\ndo <br/>\nthat yet!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny other suggestions?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am set to web only due to the copious volume of mail generated by <br/>\nthis list (always interesting, though!), so if you reply please send <br/>\nto my email.<br/>\n<br/>\nBless you all,<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11766,"nextTopicId":11769}}
