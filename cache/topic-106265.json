My kid playing video games isn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to create a medical bill that I&#39;ll be paying. Neither will him not <br/>\ncleaning his plate (something that I have NEVER nor ever WILL demand of my <br/>\nkids. I don&#39;t fuss about food. Period.) But a kid choosing not to brush his <br/>\nteeth, can lead to big dental bills. Especially when said kid eats lots of <br/>\nsweets.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course being a parent costs money. I expect that. And i do provide <br/>\nhealthy food for nibbling, and I have also informed my kids that eating a <br/>\nslice of cheese, if they can&#39;t get to a toothbrush, is healthier for them <br/>\nthan not. I guess cheese neutralizes acids or something. Sugarless gum, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, when i go to bed at night, one of the things I say to them is &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>\nforget to brush your teeth.&quot; (along with &quot;I love you. Please keep the noise <br/>\ndown.&quot; etc.) And sometimes I remind them during the day &quot;You&#39;ve been eating <br/>\ncandy. Don&#39;t forget to brush tonight.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the reason I do, is because cavities cost me money, and it&#39;s *mostly* <br/>\npreventable. I know it&#39;s not dyed in the wool guaranteed that brushing <br/>\nprevents cavities, but I&#39;m sure that not brushing allows the germs to breed, <br/>\nand I&#39;m sure that isn&#39;t good.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, HeidiC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Fri, 27 May 2005 20:51:57 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dezigna@...\">dezigna@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: Re: intro and food concerns<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I&#39;m all for kids making choices, but when I have to foot<br/>\n&gt;the bill for the dental caries...then I get to tell them what to do.
