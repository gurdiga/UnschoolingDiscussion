We (my hubby and I) know that we want to do homeschooling. <br/>\nI am just not sure what avenue to take.  Unschooling philosophies are<br/>\nappealing to me and make sense.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is, what do you do?  I got a pretty good idea of what<br/>\nunschooling is not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently my daughter loves the time that her sister takes a nap and we do<br/>\n&quot;homeschooling.&quot;  This is more a term than an actuality.  But a couple<br/>\ntimes a week, we do practice writing letters and spelling her name.  On<br/>\noccassion I have been teaching her the names of different coins and<br/>\nteaching her how to classify fruits and vegetables.  These are both done<br/>\nthrough game like activities.  I chose these 2 areas, because she seems to<br/>\nhave been picking up on it on her own and I wanted to strengthen her<br/>\nknowledge.  Anyway, the time we do spend is usually focused time.  It&#39;s<br/>\neasiest to do when her 2 year old sister is napping.  Oh, and we always do<br/>\nsome craft or cooking activity too.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, she absolutely loves this time, and begs for it everyday.  I<br/>\nget the feeling that unschooling would be much less casual than this<br/>\nfocused time I have been spending.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn your opinion, what are some things I should be doing.  And should I<br/>\ncontinue what I am doing, since she enjoys it so much?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarli</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7084,"nextTopicId":7099}}
