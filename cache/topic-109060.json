Adults do not see this anger, but other<br/>\nchildren often &gt;become targets because of it.   Vicky Bennison<br/>\n <br/>\nI saw the anger the other night at a rock concert.  Our family and some<br/>\nunschooling friends went to see a friend&#39;s rock band.  The band that<br/>\nplayed before them was a nu-metal band (punk and metal combined) made up<br/>\nof young high school kids.  They had a large following mostly young<br/>\nteenage boys. Apparently, our friend&#39;s band was suppose to go on at 9:00<br/>\nbut one of the dad&#39;s from the nu-metal band called the show director and<br/>\ninsisted that they play at 9:00 because the boys needed to be home by<br/>\n10:00 since it was a school night.  Thus, our friends band was pushed<br/>\nback to 10:00. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen the nu-metal music started, the dance floor turned into a mosh pit<br/>\nof young angry white boys.  Most of these boys are middle to upper<br/>\nmiddle class California suburban high school students.  It was a little<br/>\nscary to see the anger played out on the dance floor.  I actually took<br/>\nmy five year old daughter outside until they were done.   The mosh pit<br/>\nconsisted only of boys and no girls were allowed to participate.  I have<br/>\nseen mosh pits before and I don&#39;t remember such anger and violent<br/>\nbehavior.  Either the pits have changed or maybe it is me that has<br/>\nchanged.  Anyway, I believe that it is a good thing that these boys have<br/>\na place to release their anger in a somewhat safe and probably very fun<br/>\nand exciting environment but it is so unfortunate that they have so much<br/>\nanger.  I have no doubt that this is a good example of children who do<br/>\nnot have freedom of choice and have been controlled most of their lives.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have a 12 year old son who has had a lot of freedom since leaving<br/>\nschool 4 years ago and I truly do not see any of the anger that was<br/>\nportrayed the other night in that mosh pit in my son.  He is such a<br/>\nhappy free young pre-teen with choices that he is not afraid to make.<br/>\nIn fact, he and his unschooled friends decided to step outside on the<br/>\npatio during the nu-metal band and wait for the next band to come<br/>\non-stage.  Another moment to be thankful that I have found unschooling<br/>\nand the freedom it has given our family.<br/>\n <br/>\nDeanne<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n<br/>\nSecondary<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Secondary+school+education&w1=Secon\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Secondary+school+education&w1=Secon</a><br/>\ndary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+educat<br/>\nion&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chic<br/>\nago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=ZmtJ9eV8jDgLVf_rQitp3g&gt;  school<br/>\neducation <br/>\nGraduate<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Second\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Second</a><br/>\nary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+educati<br/>\non&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chica<br/>\ngo+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=_ar44lA2aVf7qUVJT2dfbA&gt;  school<br/>\neducation <br/>\nHome<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Secondary+\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Secondary+</a><br/>\nschool+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w<br/>\n4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+s<br/>\nchool+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=igfV0UPAcfSvC6KUmUYY6w&gt;  school education<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGraduate<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education+online&w1\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education+online&w1</a><br/>\n=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+<br/>\neducation&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w<br/>\n6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=OHt1qK6J19R35_4ff-oJHg&gt;<br/>\nschool education online <br/>\nHigh<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Secondary+\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Secondary+</a><br/>\nschool+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w<br/>\n4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+s<br/>\nchool+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=BV3EOkp5uIRJ0eqRAZQNcw&gt;  school education<br/>\n<br/>\nChicago<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Chicago+school+education&w1=Seconda\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Chicago+school+education&w1=Seconda</a><br/>\nry+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+educatio<br/>\nn&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicag<br/>\no+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=pesFSb8HMcPS2_oNEoEwuw&gt;  school<br/>\neducation <br/>\n <br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
