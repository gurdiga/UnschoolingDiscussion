I believed <br/>\nthat the only way to truly teach a child was to make them do worksheets, <br/>\ndrill and repetition.  Since hearing you speak, my husband and I have <br/>\ndiscussed our approach to teaching many times.   I was slowly starting to <br/>\nrealize the benefits of an unschooling approach.  Reading an article by <br/>\nDaniel Quinn (link below) was the last straw.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI’m not ready to throw away all of my curriculum, but I am definitely making <br/>\nthe move toward a more relaxed, child led style.   I’m going to see myself <br/>\nmuch more as a nurturer of Connor’s love of reading  and learning, rather <br/>\nthan an instructor. <br/>\n<br/>\nI thank you (and my kids would too, if they knew) for your inspiration.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou’ve probably already seen this – but here’s the link to Daniel Quinn’s <br/>\narticle.  I don’t agree with all of his ideas.    Most are probably truer <br/>\nthan I’m willing to admit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.ishmael.org/education/writings/unschooling.shtml<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52106,"nextTopicId":51991}}
