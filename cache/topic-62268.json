What a blast!!  The kids really<br/>\nlove it that they can ride with me and not worry about falling over and<br/>\nI really love having someone on my rides with me without worrying about<br/>\nthem getting run over.  My 8 yo is just getting her balance on a two<br/>\nwheeled bike and it&#39;s been a long frustrating haul for both of us.  She<br/>\nhas really wanted to be able to ride, but was really scared about<br/>\nfalling.  Her feet can finally reach the ground and that has been really<br/>\nhelpful.  Both my girls are tiny (38 and 40 lbs) and learning to ride<br/>\nwas even more difficult because the smallest bikes we could buy were<br/>\nstill to big.  And, they are just not extremely physical kids. Anyway,<br/>\nif you like to ride and your kids aren&#39;t too heavy, I really recommend a<br/>\ntrailerbike.

We bought one (Burley <br/>\nPiccolo) when our son was 4 and too big to be in the trailer with his <br/>\nsister anymore. So he pedaled behind me on that for a year or more <br/>\nbefore trying his hand at two-wheeled balancing. I think it helps <br/>\ngive them a feel for it, and it&#39;s totally stable. Around here, you <br/>\ncan rent them in bike stores for the afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The bike he has is a hand-me-down Toys R Us peice of rubbish (in my <br/>\n&gt;opinion....) so I&#39;m tempted to buy him a nice bike from the bike <br/>\n&gt;shop. Hubby says no, kids that size don&#39;t need &#39;proper&#39; bikes<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We got a nice Trek bike for our son after he learned to ride without <br/>\ntraining wheels (he was almost 6). It&#39;s a terrific *real* bike, with <br/>\ngood hand brakes and 6 gears. I think it&#39;s great for kids to have a <br/>\nreal quality bike if they&#39;re going to be riding it a lot. He has <br/>\nridden up to 8 miles on it on his own steam, so I&#39;m glad we invested <br/>\nand got him a good one. Plus, I have to say I really believe in <br/>\nsupporting small bike stores and not the Toys R Us type places, if <br/>\npossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat helped him best in learning to ride a 2-wheeler is that we <br/>\nborrowed a bike without training wheels that a friend had outgrown <br/>\nand just kept it in the garage. We told him he could ride it or sit <br/>\non it if he wanted to, but he still had his regular bike with the <br/>\ntraining wheels on to ride whenever he wanted to. I think it really <br/>\nhelps to take the pressure off of removing the training wheels. Then <br/>\nyou either ride it, or you have to put the darned things back on. <br/>\nThis gave him all kinds of options.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first, he wasn&#39;t too interested in that bike. But one day he just <br/>\ngot on it and glided a few inches. Then a few inches more. A few days <br/>\nlater he could glide across the entire garage. I casually mentioned <br/>\nthat we could take it to the park if he wanted to go further. He did. <br/>\nWe took it and he glided some more. Then I did the run along behind <br/>\nhim and hold onto the seat thing until he got the balance down, and <br/>\nhe took off riding that day. Fortunately, a friend of mine was at the <br/>\npark and captured it all on video. That week we took him to pick out <br/>\nhis new bike at the bike store. The next week, he asked to ride it to <br/>\nthe toy store to buy some Legos, it was a 6 mile round trip. He made <br/>\nit with no problem! I think riding the trailerbike for two years <br/>\nahead of time gave him a lot of stamina for longer rides.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I liked just having a bike around with no training <br/>\nwheels without having to take the wheels off of the bike he was  <br/>\nalready comfortable on. It definitely removes all the pressure and <br/>\nleaves the ball in their court.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":114499515,"authorName":"Lara Nabours","from":"&quot;Lara Nabours&quot; &lt;nabours@...&gt;","profile":"homenlovinit","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Bikeriding","postDate":"1048900061","msgId":62338,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE1BQkJLTUNPRUZISUtJSlBBSUNLQUVHTUVFQUEubmFib3Vyc0BhdHRiaS5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGQuZDEyZDVhMy4yYmI1Y2VjYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62305,"nextInTopic":62353,"prevInTime":62337,"nextInTime":62339,"topicId":62268,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That s so interesting.

It usually ends up with him kicking the bike and storming off home (red-head temper!)<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to persuade him to sit behind me on my bike so he can feel how a bike moves and balances but its a no-no at the moment.<br/>\nThe bike he has is a hand-me-down Toys R Us peice of rubbish (in my opinion....) so I&#39;m tempted to buy him a nice bike from the bike shop. Hubby says no, kids that size don&#39;t need &#39;proper&#39; bikes. I did<br/>\nlook round the other day but they had nothing small enough apart from those girly pink and white tricycles with ribbons on the handlebars (yuck).<br/>\nHo hum<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Bikeriding","postDate":"1048867038","msgId":62292,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEtRjE2NVNvUkticEcxS2kwMDAwNjY0NEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":62290,"nextInTopic":62296,"prevInTime":62291,"nextInTime":62293,"topicId":62268,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Two years ago we bought him a new mountain bike. He is <br/>\nseven years old now, and only 2 inches short of 5 feet tall, about 150 pds. <br/>\nNo small fry! He was terrified of this bike when we got it, cried, fell, and <br/>\nI got mad at him for being scared, tried to bully him into riding it, and <br/>\nthen we put it away and got him a large wheeled scooter for our rural roads. <br/>\nLast year we dragged the bike out again, and he cried again and was scared, <br/>\nand I got mad, tried bullying again, then we put it away again. <br/>\nYesterday, Tommy wanted to try his bike again. I groaned inwardly, but agreed <br/>\nto help.<br/>\nWe took out the bike. Much crying and screaming, he said he was so scared, <br/>\nbut really wanted to try it . He screamed, bellowed, and hollered. Big kid, <br/>\nbig voice!!!<br/>\nI simply listened, said I understood how conflicted he must be, said he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to . The crying continued. I waited, then quietly said I <br/>\nunderstood, but would he please either get on or put it away, as the yelling <br/>\nwas getting to be a bit much! <br/>\nTommy  stopped yelling, got on the bike, and rode it!! He rode it and rode it <br/>\nand rode it some more. He then informed me he would sleep better because he <br/>\nwould not dream that he would never ride a bike anymore.<br/>\nEverything that I despair of  him doing he does when HE is ready. I will try <br/>\nto never push him again. I hope I don&#39;t go to hell for all the mistakes I <br/>\nhave made with this child. I hope he speaks to me when he is older. <br/>\nI felt the need to share this story . It simply amazes me over and over  when <br/>\nthis happens.<br/>\nNancy in BC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62243,"nextTopicId":62466}}
