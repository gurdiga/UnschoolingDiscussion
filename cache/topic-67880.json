I&#39;m not exactly sure when she started<br/>\nreading, but she was going strong when she was only 3.  There is nothing<br/>\nthat I could have done to have stopped this.  She was reading board<br/>\nbooks at 2.  It is in her nature to look at a word and just know what it<br/>\nsays.  I think that it is genetic since I was that way as well.  I toyed<br/>\nwith the idea of getting various curriculums for her when she was<br/>\nyounger, the thing that stopped me (then) was that I could see how ZoÃ«<br/>\nrefused to ever learn how to do anything unless she was interested in<br/>\nit.  She already knew at least half the things in all the curriculums<br/>\nthat I looked over for kids in grades k- about 5th.  The rest of the<br/>\nthings I knew that she would learn them if AND ONLY IF she ever had a<br/>\nneed and desire to learn them.

She started teaching them phonics etc early so of course they<br/>\nwere advanced readers. She followed a classical education so of course they went on<br/>\nto get advanced degrees. Everything was about what she did and very little about<br/>\nwhat her kids learned on their own. She really seemed to take the approach that kids<br/>\nare empty vessels that need to be filled up. It took all I could do not to snort <br/>\nout loud at some of the things that she said (had to be good as my really good friend<br/>\nwho was with me is using the Well Trained Mind).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat really bugged me was that she really made it sound like it is completely up to the<br/>\nparents...if they do everything like she tells you to do, you will have smart well trained<br/>\nkids. So how many parents are beating themselves up because their kids do not take well<br/>\nto this method? And worse how many kids are subjected to this against their will.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one nice thing about listening to her speak is that it really hit home that unschooling<br/>\nis really right to me.

It seems almost like a reason for bragging among <br/>\nunschoolers if their kids don&#39;t read much or never write because it <br/>\nmeans they&#39;re doing so many other wonderful things.  I just wondered <br/>\nwhat if the kids, when they were three or four, had only wanted to <br/>\nlearn to read and practice writing.  Would the entire course of <br/>\nhomeschooling had gone more toward school-at-home for those <br/>\nfamilies?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother reason I associate reading a lot with classical or Charlotte <br/>\nMason homeschooling is because they are so reading-intenstive and <br/>\nmany of the books are so difficult and outdated that a child would <br/>\nhave to truly love reading to prefer The Iliad to playing in the <br/>\nmud.
