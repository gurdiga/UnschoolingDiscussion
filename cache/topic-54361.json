We <br/>\nweren&#39;t secretive about it.  Just hung them up there.  When he asked about <br/>\nthem, we told him what they were.  He ignored them for quite some time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have lots of clocks in our house.  Probably one of every kind in each <br/>\nroom.  He was always able to read digital clocks and he understood all about <br/>\ntime.  But I could tell regular clocks confused him.  He understood about <br/>\nminutes, but he couldn&#39;t understand why they weren&#39;t labelled on the clocks?  <br/>\nThe couple of times I tried to explain it to him, it wasn&#39;t easy enough.  (He <br/>\nwas 6.)  He expressed frustration when I did try and so I backed off.  I knew <br/>\nhe would figure it out, eventually, but it was frustrating to him, so I <br/>\nwanted to help without being pointed about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we hung up the 3-in-1 clock and he ignored them.  But eventually he <br/>\nnoticed them and looked at them and asked about them.  I never ever explained <br/>\nto him how they worked, except to minimally say there are hours, minutes and <br/>\nseconds there, just like the clock in the other room.  Then one day he looked <br/>\nat it and said, &quot;It&#39;s 11......40!&quot;  Yep.  That&#39;s right.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose clocks are still in over the table in the new house.  New people come <br/>\nin and try to figure out what they are, and look at them and then figure it <br/>\nout and ask why.  I use them to tell time now a lot in the kitchen.  I&#39;ll <br/>\nlook there before I look at the oven, for instance.  I takes some geting used <br/>\nto.

I think you would find it not to be a <br/>\ngreat unschooling book.  It is a good book to get strict school-at-<br/>\nhomers to relax and not feel guilty about doing fun stuff with their <br/>\nkids instead of always doing text books. However, I think it would be <br/>\neasy for someone to come away from reading that book thinking that <br/>\nwhat they do is unschooling as long as they *only* make their kids do <br/>\nmath and language arts every day. A lot of the ideas in the book are <br/>\ncloser to  relaxed or ecclectic than unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, in the &quot;What is Unschooling&quot; chapter, they have people <br/>\nquoted who say what unschooling means to them.  One person said, <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I have a definite set of goals in mind for my kids to know/learn <br/>\nduring their homeschooling.  THey need to be able to read well, write <br/>\nwell and do math.  Everything else can be pursued to their heart&#39;s <br/>\ncontent.  THey spend days obsessed with a project.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmatter, there is no hurry...&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then the author says, &quot;The common theme is allowing your children <br/>\nthe freedom to choose, in most cases, what they will learn.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some other interesting quotes from people sharing their <br/>\nideas on unschooling different subjects. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My favorite language arts idea is having my son dictate a story or <br/>\nbook to me...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;For history, we made a timeline with continuous computer paper (so <br/>\nit folds neatly back into a box), with each horizontal page <br/>\nrepresenting a century.  As my children read books about different <br/>\ntime periods or people, they mark an interesting event or date from <br/>\nthe book onto the timeline in it&#39;s proper place&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThen they have essays contributed by Christian &quot;unschoolers&quot;.  In <br/>\nintroduction, they say, &quot;Another point of contention is the purity of <br/>\nunschooling that these families may or may not represent.  Most <br/>\nunschoolers have, at one point or another, used a workbook or part of <br/>\na curriculum.  Some occasionally still do.  Sometimes this is because <br/>\nof insecurities or doubts that occasionally best us all (even many of <br/>\nthose who use a curriculum all the time have doubts about their <br/>\nchoice to homeschool) and sometimes it is because there is something <br/>\nvery important to us, that we as parents, wanted our children to <br/>\nknow...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the essays were really good but some of them sound like <br/>\nthey&#39;re describing Charlotte Mason.  Some of them make it sound ok to <br/>\nmake their kids write.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, I was disappointed in the book. When I first read it, I was <br/>\njust beginning to embrace radical unschooling.  I had already gone <br/>\nthrough the relaxed but you still have to do math stage.  I was <br/>\ntrying to get past that, and this book didn&#39;t help.  I&#39;m not saying <br/>\nthat there weren&#39;t some good thingsn about it, but it makes it seem <br/>\nlike it is really ok to keep making them do math and writing if that <br/>\nis how you want to define unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Hi...testing the waters...","postDate":"1042396060","msgId":54528,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMDRRemJYeGJIMWFNOVQyeEkwMDAwYTdlYkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":54507,"nextInTopic":54539,"prevInTime":54527,"nextInTime":54529,"topicId":54361,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Heck it started with my <br/>\nkids and fractions when they were 2 and I would cut their toast. What we <br/>\nhave to do is trust that they will learn what they need to and want to when <br/>\nit&#39;s important for them, and get this, if at all. What makes you think that <br/>\nall your kids will want and need to learn algebra to have a great life?

Don&#39;t get this in a snappish way, I&#39;m just asking. I&#39;m not quite as <br/>\nknowledgable on how to write gently like Joyce!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut really, if your child is into frogs and how many kinds there are, the <br/>\nwhole life cycle, etc. doesn&#39;t that stimulate him just as much if not more <br/>\nbecause he&#39;s learning on his own and really loving it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love for my kids to be into algebra and enjoy it. I loved math in <br/>\nhigh school. I hated history though so would I be disappointed if they <br/>\ndecided to concentrate on that instead of algebra? Not at all. I can&#39;t say <br/>\nwhat my kids will want to do when they get older. I do know I can&#39;t make <br/>\nthat call now and neither can my kids. But I do know that whatever their <br/>\ninterests are, it will lead them further into finding their way and what <br/>\nthey love and really want to do. That&#39;s for them to decide. And if my <br/>\nchildren are 17 and find that they need higher math for college, I also have <br/>\nno doubt that they will go out on their own and do what it takes to get what <br/>\nthey want.

It took us<br/>\nan hour by plane. It takes us 11 hours by car. We had 5 more hours to get to<br/>\nCalifornia. Kathryn, who was 10 at the time, said &quot;Do you know how long it<br/>\nwould take to drive to California? It would take 66 hours.&quot; *That&#39;s*<br/>\nalgebraic thinking. (Which someone neatly described as using what you know<br/>\nto figure out what you don&#39;t know.) The context of the problem supplied the<br/>\nsense of how the numbers needed to be manipulated. Her curiosity supplied<br/>\nthe desire to manipulate them.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a real life example of math in our home recently.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ds9 has decided to start collecting baseball and football cards.  He spent some of his Christmas money he received on a huge box of them and now relatives are starting to give him their old collections of cards.  He probably now has over 600-700 cards.  Some were in a long slender box and he wanted to count them all.  He had counted to about 100 or so and realized that this way would take FOREVER.  The cards were in a small box and I suggested that he measure one small part of the box, count how many were in that section, and then multiply it by how many total sections there were altogether.  He &#39;got it&#39; right away and was very thankful for the tip.  He was trying to figure out how many card protector sheets he would need........one sheet hold 9 cards, one large package of card protectors had 75 sheets ($9.95) vs. a smaller package that had only 10 sheets in it ($1.95), so......this was a very practical (for him) type of multiplication problem.   He also had to budget his remaining money so we had to find the best bargain for his money.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I found a little surprising about this situation was that instead of initially using a calculator (which he plays around with a lot) he wanted to figure it in his head, then check it on paper, then check it with the calculator.   He seems to love the problem solving aspect of things and I think using that calculator makes it just too easy for him...............<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nKimber<br/>\nThe Robbins&#39; Nest<br/>\nds Alex (9 3/4) and dd Mady (7)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Hi...testing the waters...","postDate":"1042388086","msgId":54495,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNDZGRUE2LjExRkJDJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PHYwMzExMDcxZmJhNDczNmI3ZTg4M0BbMTkyLjE2OC4xLjEwM10+"},"prevInTopic":54492,"nextInTopic":54497,"prevInTime":54494,"nextInTime":54496,"topicId":54361,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And could someone<br/>\nplease explain to me what long division actually is, and is there such a<br/>\nthing as short division?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know how to divide. Do I use &quot;long division&quot;?  Beats me.  Quite possibly<br/>\nnot, since my elementary school experience was at a &quot;free school&quot; where we<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have the usual types of &quot;subjects&quot; that most elementary schols have.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t take a math class until I was 10 and decided to listen in on a<br/>\ngroup of kids learning algebra.  (Which I immediately LOVED, and have ever<br/>\nsince!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that it&#39;s important to understand the concept of division, but<br/>\nHOW you do that is not so important.  There are several different ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to say the next bit in all-caps not because I&#39;m yelling at you,<br/>\nbut because I really, really mean it and I think it&#39;s critically important<br/>\nand most people have no idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nI HATE THE WAY SCHOOLS TEACH MATH BECAUSE IT TAKES ALL THE MEANING, JOY AND<br/>\nBEAUTY OUT OF IT!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople do NOT need to learn math the way it is taught in schools.  In fact,<br/>\nthey don&#39;t need to &quot;learn math&quot; at all.  Math is INSEPERABLE from most<br/>\neverything else in life, and if you live a full life, you&#39;ll learn all the<br/>\nmath you need because you need it.  It&#39;s there.  It&#39;s part of everything.<br/>\nYou couldn&#39;t escape it if you tried really hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nSOME people will love it and get interested and want to pursue things to a<br/>\ndeeper level and learn more advanced math and do all sorts of cool things<br/>\nwith it.  MOST won&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you try to force school math on kids early on, and turn them off the<br/>\nsubject- a VERY common thing that happens because most adults are so<br/>\nterrified of math because of their own awful school math experiences- they<br/>\nwill likely develop an aversion, and at any rate, they are extremely<br/>\nunlikely to remember what they&#39;ve &quot;learned&quot; anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much of the algebra you were taught in school do you remember and use?<br/>\nI&#39;m serious.  What do you still use?  What turned out to be irrelevant?<br/>\nWhat could you easily look up and re-learn if you needed to?  How likely<br/>\nare you to need to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What about algebra and other higher mathematics?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>First, I don&#39;t think algebra is &quot;higher math&quot; but I&#39;ll let that go.  I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s mind-candy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what about higher math?<br/>\n<br/>\nWho needs it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a real question.  What kind of people use higher math?  What do they<br/>\nuse it for?  When and how did they learn it?  You might want to find some<br/>\nand ask them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve found is this:  most people who use higher math learned some in<br/>\nschool, because that&#39;s where they were.  But MOSTLY, they learned it<br/>\nthrough using it as they needed it.  Like on-the-job training.  They took<br/>\nit further than school does because it actually interested them.  They had<br/>\na use for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember the day I realized that calculus had a purpose.  I was stunned!<br/>\nWhy didn&#39;t they ever tell us this in high school?  I had a rocky<br/>\nrelationship with calculus in high school (along with a rocky relationship<br/>\nwith just about everything, as most teens have!) but once I settled on a<br/>\ncareer path where I NEEDED it, it was suddenly easy and made sense and I<br/>\nrelearned it all in a few weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had not had that career path, I never would have looked at calculus again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI no longer have that career, and calculus is unlikely to be part of my<br/>\neveryday life (although you never know) so I no longer use it and have<br/>\nforgotten most of it.  Big deal.  (Now, I use a lot more geometry.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m reading a lot about the practical uses of what we learn, and I agree<br/>\n&gt; wholeheartedly BUT...the brain work that goes into learning and<br/>\n&gt; knowing how to do abstract number exercises like algebra, increases<br/>\n&gt; the ability of the brain to think about ANY subject.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>YES!!!  It does!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it works the other way around, too.  Learning abstract thinking any<br/>\nother way will make it easier to learn algebra, should you need to do so.<br/>\nAlgebra isn&#39;t the only way to learn it.  Just a fun one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s GOOD for<br/>\n&gt; the brain to &quot;workout&quot; by doing abstract stuff. And so, how would an<br/>\n&gt; unschooling family get algebra across to the kids? Or long division,<br/>\n&gt; for that matter? LOL<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, to start with, we don&#39;t do &quot;math&quot; at all here.  It isn&#39;t a separate<br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we use it all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike this:<br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose your Dad is coming in the morning to pick you up at 10:00am.<br/>\nYou need about an hour in the morning to get up and shower and eat<br/>\nbreakfast, to be ready to go.<br/>\nYou need about 8 or 9 hours of sleep.<br/>\nWhat time do you need to get to bed by?<br/>\n<br/>\n(The cool thing about that particular need is that it includes using<br/>\nbase-12 math as well as base-10)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy current favorite real-life mathematical figuring here:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a mini-van.<br/>\nWith all the seats in, it holds 7 people, and has a cargo space for two<br/>\nbags of fencing equipment.<br/>\nWe have 4 people, and need cargo space for about three times what fits in<br/>\nthe back.  Without the space, we had to shift bags of equipment in and out<br/>\nof the car on a daily- or even twice daily- basis, to have what we needed<br/>\nwhen and where we needed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never made the shift from being 5 people to being 4 people, at least not<br/>\nin a practical way.<br/>\nOne of my kids did.<br/>\nHe suggested one day that instead of shifting gear around and having to<br/>\nmove it in and out of the car all the time, why not take the back seat out,<br/>\nhave seating for 4, and then keep all the gear in the car permanently.  Not<br/>\nonly that, but it could be organized so we wouldn&#39;t even have to shift it<br/>\naround for any particular class, each thing could be reached individually.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe redesigned the layout of everything in the car.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe changed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nA simple change that required a large conceptual leap-which he made, but<br/>\nthe rest of us had not- and now, life is much simpler.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo really understand this and the effect it had, you should know that I<br/>\nteach fencing, 6 classes per week, plus I give individual lessons.  Four<br/>\ndifferent locations for the classes.  Several different locations for the<br/>\nlessons.  Different groups of people at each class, with different<br/>\nequipment needs.  And all three kids fence, but they don&#39;t attend the same<br/>\nclasses.  I have equipment in the car for about 30 people, plus a variety<br/>\nof training equipment and record keeping stuff.  We were really having an<br/>\nissue with having the right gear in the car.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlgebra is the art of taking the information you have, the things you know,<br/>\nand using that to figure out the information you don&#39;t have, that you need<br/>\nto know.  It&#39;s a puzzle.  That&#39;s all.  You &quot;expose&quot; kids to it by doing it,<br/>\nby playing with it freely and uninhibitedly.  By finding things fascinating<br/>\nand wanting to figure out what you don&#39;t know.  By experimenting.  By<br/>\nneeding it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I &quot;make&quot; my kids do their math...lying in a puddle of sunshine on the<br/>\n&gt; front room floor, wrap-ups in the recliner, Math Minute drills, etc.<br/>\n&gt; Right now, the two younger ones are playing dominos...MATH!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s playing dominoes.  Why not let it be that?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy separate math out of everything all the time?  Why do people do that?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way to learn math naturally is to let it be a natural part of<br/>\neverything, like it is, and not make such a point of it all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, what if, in writing and speaking, you had to stop and make a<br/>\npoint of every time you used the letter &quot;e&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nLook, I&#39;m writing an e-mail...  USING THE LETTER E!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow ridiculous is that?<br/>\n<br/>\nYet people do it to math all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  but would<br/>\n&gt; unschooling REALLY say not to give them seat work to practice their<br/>\n&gt; basic number skills, and on a consistent basis?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say it, but I also would NEVER do it.  SEATWORK?!???<br/>\nWhat on earth for?!?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd who came up with a term like that anyway?  I find the very concept<br/>\nnauseating, I really do.  Sit here and do this.  Whether you like it or<br/>\nnot.  Whether you have any use for it or not.  Stay in your seat, do your<br/>\nseatwork.  YUCK.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis does not mean that we don&#39;t have a zillion math books around here,<br/>\nincluding workbooks and such. We do. I probably have more math books than<br/>\nmost schools do.  But it&#39;s because I enjoy them.  I NEVER make or even ask<br/>\nmy kids to have anything to do with them.  It&#39;s my special interest, not<br/>\ntheirs.  Once in a while, they&#39;ll pick one up, look through it, put it back<br/>\ndown.  Sometimes, they&#39;ll use computer software that has math games on it-<br/>\nmore so when they were very young, not so much now.  But I have never and<br/>\nwill never require it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will, however, discuss with them when I&#39;m working on trigonometry for<br/>\nfun.  It&#39;s interesting to me, and they might also think it is. So far, mild<br/>\ninterest, no real excitement.  That&#39;s fine.  They know it&#39;s here.  And they<br/>\nknow something about what it&#39;s for. They can ask if they need to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing for my kids having to do with math is that I love it, and<br/>\nthey know it.  No math anxiety here. (Except for when my daughter had an<br/>\nissue with girls in her scout troop telling her she&#39;s not learning anything<br/>\nbecause she&#39;s homeschooled, and she came home wanting to &quot;do math&quot; and we<br/>\nhad a little talk about that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople learn best by having resources available, and interesting things to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning is interest-driven.  Joy-driven.  Need-driven.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut please don&#39;t make it a command performance.  ESPECIALLY with math,<br/>\nwhich is already handicapped by a national phobia about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing you can do for your kids with math is to learn to love it<br/>\nyourself.  Play with it.  REALLY learn it.  Not just how to calculate, but<br/>\nwhy it works that way.  Why does borrowing work?  Why does carrying work?<br/>\nWhat is the real meaning of &quot;place value&quot; and why?  Why do we use base-10<br/>\nmath.  Learn some other system.  Learn to multiply in binary.  Play with<br/>\nnumbers. Play with shapes.  Why are &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot; called that? Is it<br/>\nimportant?  How many math words do you know? How many math words do you use<br/>\nevery day? (Count them!  Make a list!)  How much math is there in your life<br/>\nthat you are so comfortable with you&#39;re not aware of it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my very favorite math question:<br/>\n<br/>\nHow, exactly, do you know when it&#39;s safe to cross the street?<br/>\n<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay with patterns.  Play with sets.  Go outside and throw rocks and pay<br/>\nattention to the paths they travel.  Drop stones into a pond and watch the<br/>\nripples.  Figure out why buildings don&#39;t fall down- or why they do.  Ponder<br/>\nwhy the wind off Lake Michigan travels through the city of Chicago the way<br/>\nit does.  And Oklahoma, where the wind comes sweeping down the plains...<br/>\nwhat&#39;s different in very windy places?  How do you need to change things to<br/>\naccomodate that?  Or other weather?  Why are most of the roofs in places<br/>\nthat get a lot of snow not flat?<br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on and on and on and on.  You can, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion everything.  Figure some of it out.  Don&#39;t worry about whether you<br/>\nare learning math or not. You are.  It&#39;s there. It&#39;s ALWAYS there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I waited for them<br/>\n&gt; to come to me asking how to divide...well, I sure wouldn&#39;t hold my<br/>\n&gt; breath!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why would they not ask you?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they needed to divide and couldn&#39;t figure it out, they woudn&#39;t ask for help?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is it that you believe they&#39;d never need to?<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, we buy a box of popsicles.  In our family, treats like that are<br/>\nportioned out by shares, so each kid gets a fair share.  They&#39;re into this.<br/>\nBut the youngest used to have to ask me how to figure out what her share<br/>\nwas.  She very specifically DID come to me and ask me to help her figure it<br/>\nout- to learn how to divide.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she thought it was cool, and figured out shares of practically<br/>\neverything in the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut NONE of my kids, as far as I know, can do division on paper, using the<br/>\nmethod taught in schools.  They&#39;ve never needed to.  They do it in their<br/>\nheads.  They estimate, when that&#39;s good enough for what they need.  They<br/>\nuse calculators.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd honestly, that&#39;s what almost everyone does in real life when they need<br/>\nto divide big numbers anyway, because few people trust their own figuring<br/>\nenough to use it without checking.  I used to freak people out when I ran a<br/>\nfood buying club and did all the invoicing and such by hand, no calculator.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; truly, just wanting to figure it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about.

(It helps<br/>\nto play the games with them. Games *are* math. The strategy necessary is a<br/>\nmuch higher order of mathematical thinking than school or math program can<br/>\nprovide. It&#39;s on the order of chess. And we all &quot;know&quot; how good chess is for<br/>\nthinking :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra has a great section on her website about video games:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt *is* uncomfortable to watch my daughter watch TV. But I&#39;ve come to<br/>\nrecognize that it comes when she&#39;s in between ideas for her drawings and<br/>\nwritings. It might be down time as the brain runs in the back ground for<br/>\ninspiration or waiting for someting that does inspire her. Or both. Or<br/>\nsomething else. I&#39;ve just gain confidence that she there are things she<br/>\nloves doing besides watching TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if there weren&#39;t, I think I remember Steven Spielberg mentioning how<br/>\nmuch he *loved* TV as a kid! There&#39;s a reason kids are drawn to what they&#39;re<br/>\ndrawn to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This has turned out way long. Sorry.

But what they&#39;re trying to provide is the best *mass* education.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then people assume that since schools provide a general education then<br/>\nthat&#39;s what they need to do at home to provide the best education.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92084939,"authorName":"Heidi &lt;bunsofaluminum60@hotmail.com&gt;","from":"&quot;Heidi &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;","profile":"heidic40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Hi...testing the waters...","postDate":"1042383007","msgId":54471,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGF2cnZhditldG5hQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBNDZEMEFBLjExRjdBJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":54467,"nextInTopic":54486,"prevInTime":54470,"nextInTime":54472,"topicId":54361,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Joyce thanks.

But it still isn&#39;t something I would say I&#39;m <br/>\nnervous about. I&#39;ve had to defend our decision not to start Katie <br/>\nuntil she was eight, many times. It matters not one whit to me that <br/>\nshe&#39;s &quot;behind grade level.&quot; She wasn&#39;t ready for formal <br/>\nlearning...but now this unschooling thing is telling me formal <br/>\nlearning isn&#39;t the way kids learn best, anyway. sheesh. see how ya <br/>\nare? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* kids are allowed to pursue what interests<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; them, then they acquire the skills and knowledge they need for those<br/>\n&gt; interests as they need them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ah! and herein lies the rub! *If* Robby pursues only what interests <br/>\nhim, he will be going from video to computer game, and back again to <br/>\nthe TV. Maybe I&#39;m not getting it, but surely an hour doing division <br/>\nat the kitchen table is stretching his brain better than shooting <br/>\ndown asteroids on the computer for an hour? <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I&#39;ve said that, I&#39;m thinking about my 15 year old daughter. <br/>\nShe is a voracious and very good reader. Better at reading than I am, <br/>\nand I&#39;m a GOOD reader. Because I am a Tolkien fan, I introduced The <br/>\nHobbit to her when she was seven. She ate it up. At age 10, she read <br/>\nLord of the Rings. She read it again. She immersed herself in Middle <br/>\nEarth, checking out books of artwork by various artists, writing <br/>\nabout the strengths and weaknesses in the different characters of the <br/>\nbook, and of course, spent lots of time online chatting with other <br/>\nTolkien people, and looking forward mightily to the release of the <br/>\nmovie. I let her &quot;pursue her interest&quot;...and she followed it into <br/>\nMedieval Europe, and British History. She knows who William the <br/>\nConqueror was, who was King in Britain when he landed. She knows what <br/>\nthe people were called who lived in England before the Saxons came. <br/>\nShe knows all about Arthur and Gueneviere and Camelot. She has read <br/>\nall of Shakespeare&#39;s comedies, and is right now reading through <br/>\nCanterbury Tales...again. She walks around speaking in different <br/>\nEnglish accents: Scottish, Irish, Australian, Cockney, Liverpool. A <br/>\ntrue Anglophile, and it started at age 7, with The Hobbit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay. Does that description sound like unschooling? I didn&#39;t <br/>\ninterfere with this in any way, besides once in awhile reading a book <br/>\nshe brought home, so we could discuss it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started her in an official correspondence high school (Christian <br/>\nLiberty Academy) because at the end of last year she informed us she <br/>\nwanted more structure and more official assignments to tackle. And <br/>\nshe does get the assignments done, but she curls up comfy and just <br/>\nreads for pleasure...her history book! <br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference in this house is, Abbie is verbal. She loves reading <br/>\nand writing (and talking!) and this pursuit of Middle Earth, and <br/>\nthings English is verbally founded. My younger ones aren&#39;t proving to <br/>\nbe so verbally oriented. They do love their &quot;screen time&quot; though! <br/>\nMovies, computer games, movies again. Seems mindless to me. I&#39;d have <br/>\na really tough time just letting them go, the way I did Abbie, <br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t think that they would follow pursuits that teach them <br/>\nanything. <br/>\n<br/>\n*whimper*<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has turned out way long. Sorry. I&#39;m more thinking aloud than <br/>\nanything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;*If* schools were concerned with each individual child, they would <br/>\n&gt;provide each child with an individualized education focused on that <br/>\n&gt;child&#39;s strengths and desires and interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Provide each child with individualized education...okay, I must be <br/>\ncompletely misunderstanding. Isn&#39;t unschooling about NOT &quot;providing <br/>\nan education&quot; but simply allowing kids their head, letting them go <br/>\nwhere they will? Where does guidance and provision come into play?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; And what I think makes me nervous is...illiteracy, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What I meant by illiteracy is an overall inability to do basic skills <br/>\nneeded to have a life. Robby&#39;s not telling time, for instance. I <br/>\nreally want him to know analog time...and he gets the general idea of <br/>\nit, but has to rely on digital clocks to know what time it is. I hate <br/>\nthat. As for reading, Abbie was reading at age 5, after one official <br/>\nlesson. Robby had about a week of phonics, and then took off reading <br/>\nat age 7. Katie isn&#39;t there yet, though we have been doing phonics <br/>\nthis year, and she&#39;s 8 and a half. I&#39;m confident it will come in <br/>\ntime, but it really is like holding my breath, like the one article <br/>\nwhere a son didn&#39;t read until age 14! ack!  And I thank God every <br/>\nday, when we&#39;re looking at books, and she&#39;s sounding out words and <br/>\nstuff, that she&#39;s at home. The damage the schools would have done, <br/>\nputting her in special classes...ugh. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Unschooled kids learn to read when they are ready and when they <br/>\n </span></blockquote>need to.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Usually it&#39;s around the same age as schooled kids 6-8.

Are they feelings of progress through academic<br/>\nknowledge? It doesn&#39;t need to look like school to get those same feelings<br/>\nthat kids are making &quot;academic progress&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m not criticizing it. It&#39;s just a different goal than what unschoolers<br/>\nhave. If you have different goals than unschoolers, then it won&#39;t make sense<br/>\nthat we&#39;re giving up that sense of progress and the semi-guarantees of more<br/>\nacademic styles of homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy (new found! ;-) goal is to live today joyfully. If my daughter can<br/>\nexplore what she enjoys, that will prepare her for doing what she enjoys.<br/>\nJust as using English as a 2 yo is the foundation of a 3yos English. But a<br/>\n2yo doesn&#39;t need to prepare or practice to speak as a 3yo or a 6yo or 20yo.<br/>\nThey learn what they need as they need it ... because they need it. :-) Even<br/>\nthough a 2yo will one day become someone who might need to ask a librarian<br/>\nfor help finding a book, they don&#39;t need to practice for it. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLife rarely throws us a curve where we need to go from knowing nothing to<br/>\nknowing everything tomorrow. *If* kids are allowed to pursue what interests<br/>\nthem, then they acquire the skills and knowledge they need for those<br/>\ninterests as they need them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, on the other hand, kids are being prepared for tomorrow by getting the<br/>\nknowledge they might need one day, it&#39;s much more difficult and takes much<br/>\nlonger. They end up having spent time on things they never needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re certain that it&#39;s in the best interests of kids to acquire a<br/>\nparticular body of general knowledge because that&#39;s pretty much the only<br/>\nthing we know. (It&#39;s what schools do.) But schools were originally set up to<br/>\nprovide general knowledge *not* because kids need that body of knowledge<br/>\n(though most teachers are convinced that they do) but because it&#39;s an<br/>\nefficient way to raise the population&#39;s average level of education. It&#39;s a<br/>\nfactory process concerned not with any one item on the production line but<br/>\non the output as a whole. There will be some tremendous successes. There<br/>\nwill be some scrap. But what&#39;s important is how it all averages out.<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* schools were concerned with each individual child, they would provide<br/>\neach child with an individualized education focused on that child&#39;s<br/>\nstrengths and desires and interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they don&#39;t. They can&#39;t. It would be too expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And what I think makes me nervous is...illiteracy, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooled kids learn to read when they are ready and when they need to.<br/>\nUsually it&#39;s around the same age as schooled kids 6-8. Sometimes earlier.<br/>\nSometimes later. But by 18 those unschooled kids who learned to read later<br/>\nare indistinguishable from those who learned to read earlier. (In school<br/>\nnaturally-later readers would have been shamed and humiliated -- just by<br/>\nhaving &quot;specialists&quot; focus even kindly on something that they couldn&#39;t do --<br/>\nand convinced that they couldn&#39;t read or that reading was dumb.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do unschooled children learn long division? What do they do to<br/>\n&gt; practice it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I recognize that the world is full of numbers and opportunities to<br/>\nmanipulate those numbers. My daughter is figuring out how numbers work<br/>\nbecause she wants the information manipulating the numbers will give her.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy using math in real life she understands the context and can see why she<br/>\nneeds to do something. On a math paper 34-17 doesn&#39;t mean anything. It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have any affect on her life if she gets it right or wrong. (Which is<br/>\nwhy schools need to impose artificial consequences on getting things right<br/>\nand wrong.) But in real life, her purpose might be to figure out if she has<br/>\nenough for 2 toys. So she might subtract the price of one toy from what she<br/>\nhas or she might add the prices of the two toys together. She *wants* the<br/>\ninformation and has a stake in extracting what she needs from it. How she<br/>\ngoes about it isn&#39;t important. What&#39;s important is gaining enough<br/>\nunderstanding of why she&#39;s doing what she&#39;s doing. And the understanding is<br/>\npretty much built in to the problem because it&#39;s a problem in real life. She<br/>\nwon&#39;t make the mistake of subtracting the price of one toy from the other.<br/>\nShe won&#39;t add the price of one toy to how much she has. It wouldn&#39;t make<br/>\nsense.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in school style math where the numbers are taken out of context, there<br/>\nisn&#39;t that feedback that the process you&#39;re using doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>\nSometimes you add. Sometimes you subtract. The only difference is in what<br/>\nyou&#39;re told to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool-style learning (in math programs) focuses on the mechanics of<br/>\nmanipulating numbers. The designers hope that by doing enough kids will<br/>\nunderstand, but the goal is on getting them to be able to perform the<br/>\noperations. If they do happen to understand why they&#39;d doing something<br/>\nthat&#39;s a potential side effect not the goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s *really* hard to explain! It *does* work. But the process doesn&#39;t look<br/>\nat all like school-style math learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning math from life is the way your children learned English. It was a<br/>\nuseful tool to get what they needed so they got better at it as a side<br/>\neffect. And that worked pretty well!<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning math school style is the way children learn (or don&#39;t learn!) a<br/>\nforeign language in school. It&#39;s memorization without needing something.<br/>\nIt&#39;s needing something for a right now purpose that provides the opportunity<br/>\nto understand. And that&#39;s what&#39;s lacking in school style learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What about algebra and other higher mathematics? I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; reading a lot about the practical uses of what we learn, and I agree<br/>\n&gt; wholeheartedly BUT...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; the brain work that goes into learning and<br/>\n&gt; knowing how to do abstract number exercises like algebra, increases<br/>\n&gt; the ability of the brain to think about ANY subject.

But is it the running that&#39;s good or having the<br/>\ncapacity (or potential capacity) to use you legs and lungs in that way to<br/>\nget the benefit from running that&#39;s good. Someone on crutches can&#39;t get much<br/>\nout of running.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlgebra is good if a child *wants* that type of brain exercise or enjoys<br/>\nthat type of accomplishment (even if they find it difficult). It exercises<br/>\nsomething the child finds natural to exercise.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if it isn&#39;t natural, it&#39;s like trying to exercise a body part that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a word for that type of study but I&#39;ve forgotten what it is.<br/>\nResearchers will look for a positive result and then try to find the factors<br/>\nthat are different between that and the negative result. Like why does this<br/>\ngroup of people have unclogged arteries and this group of people have<br/>\nclogged arteries.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a useful process but it does have it&#39;s flaws. It tends to focus on what<br/>\nthe factors are rather than why that those factors might be common to that<br/>\ngroup. Are Mediterraneans healthier because they use a lot of olive oil or<br/>\nbecause their bodies process fat differently?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo is it algebra that is the benefit or is it having the ability to use<br/>\nalgebra *and* having access to algebra that is the benefit?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And so, how would an<br/>\n&gt; unschooling family get algebra across to the kids?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is algebraic thinking in life. The *thinking* part is the most<br/>\nimportant in understanding. It&#39;s using algebra and understanding why you&#39;re<br/>\ndoing what you&#39;re doing. And when a problem is in context, the what and why<br/>\nare pretty obvious.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were flying from Boston to LA we stopped in Pittsburgh. It took us<br/>\nan hour by plane. It takes us 11 hours by car. We had 5 more hours to get to<br/>\nCalifornia. Kathryn, who was 10 at the time, said &quot;Do you know how long it<br/>\nwould take to drive to California? It would take 66 hours.&quot; *That&#39;s*<br/>\nalgebraic thinking. (Which someone neatly described as using what you know<br/>\nto figure out what you don&#39;t know.) The context of the problem supplied the<br/>\nsense of how the numbers needed to be manipulated. Her curiosity supplied<br/>\nthe desire to manipulate them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce there&#39;s understanding, doing it more formally is a loads easier if the<br/>\nneed is there. Trying to do it formally without understanding it is very<br/>\nvery difficult. Which is why it take *years* for schools to teach kids math.<br/>\n(And schools often fail!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are unschooled kids who have needed formal math for college who have<br/>\nlearned high school math in 6-9 months. The need was there. The background<br/>\nof having used math in context was there. That made the formal part much<br/>\neasier.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids know that whether they know something is their choice, then<br/>\nacquiring it is a lot easier. It&#39;s also easier if they don&#39;t have years of<br/>\nexperience with learning it being difficult. It&#39;s just something they want<br/>\nto learn, or are required to learn to get to something they want to learn,<br/>\nso they learn it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I &quot;make&quot; my kids do their math...lying in a puddle of sunshine on the<br/>\n&gt; front room floor, wrap-ups in the recliner, Math Minute drills, etc.<br/>\n&gt; Right now, the two younger ones are playing dominos...MATH! but would<br/>\n&gt; unschooling REALLY say not to give them seat work to practice their<br/>\n&gt; basic number skills, and on a consistent basis?

But ultimately they don&#39;t have a choice not to do<br/>\nmath in some way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a pretty picture you paint. It might be similar to if your husband<br/>\nloved to watch you snuggling with a baby in a rocker in the sunshine and<br/>\ndecided *that* was a good reason to have another baby: so he could delight<br/>\nin the image that brought him joy. And the cost to you wouldn&#39;t be part of<br/>\nhis equation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you didn¹t make them would they be doing it on their own? Even if it<br/>\nlooks peacefully satisfying, if the kids don&#39;t have a choice, then the<br/>\noutward look isn&#39;t nearly as pretty on the inside. They&#39;re just making do<br/>\nwith what they are permitted to have.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying you need to change. I&#39;m just describing the difference. If<br/>\nwhat you&#39;re doing works fine, there&#39;s no impetus to try out something that<br/>\nwill probably not feel very satisfying to get to what we feel is a better<br/>\nplace.
