My husband Jimmy and I live<br/>\n&gt; just outside of Chicago with our 2 kiddies, Jackie 2 and Joey 4<br/>\n&gt; months. We have recently decided (say in the last 12 days) to<br/>\n&gt; homeschool our kids. Right now I am making preparations to start our<br/>\n&gt; &quot;school year&quot; in late August with Jackie. Saying all of this, I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have any input about teaching methods or materials and etc.  so I will<br/>\n&gt; be seeking a lot of advice from all of you. I do know now that since<br/>\n&gt; we have made this decision, my dd and I have the best time looking at<br/>\n&gt; bugs, rocks and weeds outside!

I&#39;ve been reading, thinking and <br/>\ntalking about education and schooling or not schooling since my oldest was 2. <br/>\n I love to read and talk, and I&#39;m committed to sharing what unschooling is <br/>\nand can be with anyone who wants to listen.<br/>\n <br/>\n F<br/>\n &lt;&lt;  Imagine if you can, hating<br/>\n school, your teacher(s) and the entire environment SO much that at 7 or 8<br/>\n you hid under your bed, or in the garage, or played sick, in desperate<br/>\n attempts to avoid school. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI see this daily. There is a good book called We&#39;ve All Got Scars by Rapheala <br/>\nBest.  After reading that book I don&#39;t see how anyone can say complusory <br/>\nattendence is a good thing. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n &lt;&lt;Now, as a parent, I want so much more for my children.  I don&#39;t want them<br/>\n to feel tortured and persecuted by peers or adults.  I don&#39;t want them to<br/>\n come to see learning as a chore or knowledge as a burden.  I don&#39;t want<br/>\n them to have to submit to the wills of teachers and administrators that<br/>\n they may hate.  I don&#39;t want them to be subject to the whims of<br/>\n disillusioned teachers who have come to despise their charges, or<br/>\n instructors who know less than the children, or many worse things.  I want<br/>\n them to enjoy their childhood and get a good and thourough education at the<br/>\n SAME TIME!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLe&#39;ts define education then.. what do you see them doing in order to *become <br/>\neducated*?<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n &lt;&lt;.

I <br/>\nsuspect she&#39;s gonna need to be held and touched and taken places and fed and <br/>\nnurtured. An emotionally healthy child will learn at the speed of light.  :)  <br/>\nSo first, JUST do her emotional needs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can come here to the list and talk all about what&#39;s going on with her and <br/>\nwe can help find materials and ideas for the two/five of you.<br/>\n <br/>\n &lt;&lt; How on earth do I take a child I<br/>\n barely know out of public school, and all the other institutions that her<br/>\n life has been focused around, and intergrate her into our family and into<br/>\n learning at home??&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day at a time.  Wake up and do each and every day with an awareness that <br/>\ntoday is all that matters, at least for awhile. You focus on her, she&#39;ll <br/>\nfocus on learning.  I promise.<br/>\n <br/>\n &lt;&lt;  Until now I assumed that homeschooling required that your<br/>\n child complete certain subjects in a certain order and be tested regularly<br/>\n to ensure they are up to &quot;grade&quot; level ( I heard that somewhere &quot;once upon<br/>\n a time.&quot;)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re here to definately break that notion. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  What a wonderful notion that children can be allowed to be<br/>\n children, not miniature adults, and learn freely and naturally allowing the<br/>\n marvelous human brain to do it&#39;s awe inspiring work of growing, learning<br/>\n and being! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYep and it&#39;s so simple it&#39;s hard to believe at first.

By the way, we are<br/>\nlocated in Idaho, recently moved from Washington state.  We were married on<br/>\nSan Juan Island, and lived in the Tri-Cities.  My husband grew up there but<br/>\nI did not.  It&#39;s a small world!<br/>\n<br/>\nHi there all!<br/>\nPlease excuse the gargantuan proportions of this message.  I have a number<br/>\nof things to convey in order to solicit advice that is accurate to our<br/>\nsituation.  I also want to let you get to know us a &#39;little&#39; (a word used<br/>\nvery loosely!)  I just joined the list, and as such, have not yet gotten<br/>\nany idea about the types of amounts of messages speeding through<br/>\ncyberspace.  However, I would like to introduce myself, and ask you<br/>\n&quot;veteran&quot; homeschoolers/unschoolers out there for a little advice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all I would like to say...WOW!  This is my first experience with<br/>\n&quot;Unschooling&quot; and I am fascinated, and excited!!  I have planned to<br/>\nhomeschool my children since before they were born.  Having grown up in a<br/>\nbig city with parents who were apathetic, and being socially awkward, I had<br/>\nagonies in public school my entire school career.  Picture a child who<br/>\ncomes home in hysterics at least a couple of times a week from the<br/>\nemotional pain of peer inflicted tortures.  Imagine if you can, hating<br/>\nschool, your teacher(s) and the entire environment SO much that at 7 or 8<br/>\nyou hid under your bed, or in the garage, or played sick, in desperate<br/>\nattempts to avoid school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe playing sick was a big mistake because I was a very sickly child and<br/>\noften when I really WAS sick I was called a liar and sent to school anyway.<br/>\n Once I actually ended up in the ER and had the satisfaction of hearing the<br/>\ndoctor reprimand my mother for not noticing the very overt sympotms that<br/>\nare the prelude to my particular condition at the time.  That week in the<br/>\nhospital I got whatever I asked her for! <br/>\n<br/>\nEventually I took charge of my own education.  I left public school at age<br/>\n14, against my parents wishes and those of the Principal at the High<br/>\nSchool, and began attending an independant study school.  There I attended<br/>\na meeting with my instructor once a week to go over assignments, recieve<br/>\nnew work assignments, discuss problems, etc, and the rest of my time was up<br/>\nto me to organize.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as a parent, I want so much more for my children.  I don&#39;t want them<br/>\nto feel tortured and persecuted by peers or adults.  I don&#39;t want them to<br/>\ncome to see learning as a chore or knowledge as a burden.  I don&#39;t want<br/>\nthem to have to submit to the wills of teachers and administrators that<br/>\nthey may hate.  I don&#39;t want them to be subject to the whims of<br/>\ndisillusioned teachers who have come to despise their charges, or<br/>\ninstructors who know less than the children, or many worse things.  I want<br/>\nthem to enjoy their childhood and get a good and thourough education at the<br/>\nSAME TIME!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here I am!  My name is Nanci Kuykendall and my husband is Tom.  Our<br/>\nchildren (Thomas and Alexander) are still far from &quot;school age&quot; and so,<br/>\nalthough I knew I was going to homeschool, I had not done any research into<br/>\nthe arena until now.  Now we have a new situation arrising, and that is<br/>\nwhere I need help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are in the process of adopting a little girl (we have two boys) and have<br/>\nbeen struggling in the course of our research with all the confusing<br/>\noptions and pros and cons in various adoption scenarios.
