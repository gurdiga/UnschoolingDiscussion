If he&#39;s already old and <br/>\ndebilitated, I&#39;d personally let it ride. It&#39;s an arsenic treatment---THAT can <br/>\nkill them too!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeartworm is prevalent whereever you have water/humidity/heat=mosquitos. <br/>\nYou&#39;re almost guaranteed the bug, Shyrley! Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the food, I can&#39;t imagine if you&#39;re diligent with what/how you feed him <br/>\nthat your dog would get fat. My dogs, GSD & beagle, eat whatever scraps we <br/>\nhave. I decrease their dry food when I add scraps. Been doing this to <br/>\ndifferent dogs/different breeds for over 30 years. NEVER a fat dog! Not even <br/>\nthe beagle!!! I just wish someone would do that for me! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNot one has ever chosen NOT to eat in order to wait for table scraps. It goes <br/>\nin their bowls with their regular kibble. Some meals they get some, some not. <br/>\nIt&#39;s breakfast and supper, not &quot;dessert&quot;. They don&#39;t beg because all meals <br/>\nare served in their bowls. They may be a little more &quot;excited&quot; about meals <br/>\nwith mac & cheese or rice & gravy or steak, but it&#39;s all just food to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI show my dogs, so weight is very important. I wouldn&#39;t take any chances with <br/>\na finicky eater or a fat dog. Never happens. They eat what&#39;s in front of them <br/>\nin less than two minutes--no matter WHAT&#39;s in front of them!<br/>\n<br/>\nChocolate IS toxic to dogs: a Chihuahua can die/be very ill if he eats a <br/>\nHershey bar---it&#39;s a weight thing. Years ago before I knew about it, my <br/>\nWeimaraners would get a bag of M&M&#39;s to share for their birthdays. None ever <br/>\ngot sick. Would I do it again? Nope. A Bullmastiff would have to eat a LOT of <br/>\nM&M&#39;s to even feel nauseous. I wouldn&#39;t purposefully give my dogs chocolate, <br/>\nbut I don&#39;t freak when they raid the fudge plate (I just remove the slimy <br/>\nones and place it higher!&lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44882,"nextTopicId":44881}}
