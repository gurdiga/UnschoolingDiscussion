My name is Angela and I am mom to three kids with another on <br/>\nthe way this winter from China.  We are beginning our fourth year of <br/>\nhsing but have decided to take the plunge and unschool.  I will still <br/>\nprobably be a bit more scheduled than some of you since it makes me <br/>\ntoo nervous to cut out a math text but other than that...well, we&#39;ll <br/>\nsee what happens.  My question to all of you is this....how do you <br/>\nensure your children are covering all the bases and aren&#39;t missing<br/>\nout <br/>\n on whole subject areas?  Do you direct their learning at all with <br/>\nsuggestions for the day, or do you just have lots of resources around <br/>\nand let them decide?  As a former school-at-home mom (pretty much <br/>\nanyway).....it&#39;s scary.  Thanks for any input you may have.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\nBlessed mom of 3</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8791,"nextTopicId":8829}}
