I doubt they will be sitting around trying to solve complicated <br/>\nmath problems! &lt;bg&gt;  I know it&#39;s hard not to compare sometimes.  Ridding <br/>\nmyself of comparisons was a HUGE step towards unschooling for me.  There are <br/>\ndays when I still have doubts.  (Usually when I&#39;ve been hounded by my <br/>\nhusband or some other family member.)  What clinched it for me was my <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s handwriting.  For YEARS, I pushes and prodded with her illegible <br/>\nhandwriting.  We tried everything.  I put off cursive until 5th grade <br/>\nbecause I figured it she couldn&#39;t even write decently in print, how would <br/>\nshe ever write in cursive???  So dumb!  When I threw out *my* need for <br/>\ncurriculum and schedules and embraced unschooling, Haleigh stopped writing <br/>\nfor what seemed like forever.  Then, on Valentine&#39;s Day, she presented me <br/>\nwith the most beautifully written letter...in cursive!!!!  Evidently, she <br/>\nhad been practicing (without me even being aware of the fact) in her Italics <br/>\nworkbook.  I dare say her cursive is even better than the book!!!  It was at <br/>\nthat moment that I realized that she *may* never print legibly.  So what!  <br/>\nIt still looks like chicken scratch to me.  Then there is my husband who&#39;s <br/>\ncursive is chicken scratch and his printing looks perfect!  To each his own!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will always be weak and strong areas for every human being on earth.  <br/>\nEveryone is their own worst critic, would you agree?

Kids in parochial <br/>\nschools are in a hybrid situation, but there are still people who don&#39;t think <br/>\nparochial education should have ever been legal in the U.S.  And lately <br/>\n(lately twenty years) lots of lamer &quot;Christian&quot; equivalent schools have <br/>\nsprung up, many of them run in church basements or Sunday school rooms during <br/>\nthe week, and are just A Beka done at the church table instead of the kitchen <br/>\ntable at home.

We &quot;abandoned the schools,&quot; <br/>\nand (they will say) don&#39;t even care what happens to other people&#39;s kids.  We <br/>\ntook some of the best kids out (teachers have said many times) and that makes <br/>\ntheir job harder, and the student body averages are lower (? socially?  for <br/>\ntesting purposes? as far as who was sparkly and interesting? whose moms would <br/>\nbring cupcakes?  some or all of that).<br/>\n<br/>\nToo bad the class sizes aren&#39;t lower!  THAT is what I wish would happen.   <br/>\nThat funding would change so that each of our kids left &quot;an empty desk&quot; and <br/>\nthe student teacher ratio would finally be closer to manageable and <br/>\npersonable.   But the school just shrinks like an evaporating puddle so that <br/>\nthey&#39;re still just as crowded and just as outnumbered, because they get a <br/>\nper-head count of who&#39;s there, not a per-head of who&#39;s in the the community.  <br/>\nAnd that&#39;s too bad.

She is one of those people who <br/>\nthinks that any mention of your choices, children&#39;s actions, etc. are <br/>\nsomehow requests for her advice.  She drives me batty.  I say &quot;Oh, <br/>\nthe baby isnt talking yet&quot; in passing converstion, no worries here.  <br/>\nAnd she replies, &quot;Well that is developmentaly <br/>\nappropriate..blah..blah..blah.  ARGGGHHHHH!  I KNOW!!  Anyway, we <br/>\nhave mentioned homeschooling in the past and got the &quot;Just so you <br/>\nknow...I knew some kids...blah..blah..&quot;  I am not looking forward to <br/>\nher passive aggressive behavior once she finds out Keiran is home and <br/>\nnot going on to school...&lt;G&gt;.   It will drive her mad.  Especially <br/>\nsince she is one of those people who always has to make the &quot;right&quot; <br/>\nchoice.  This type of decision will just completely throw her!  Oh, <br/>\nwell I told my husband it was his sister, he could deal with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I cannot understand people who say homeschoolers are slackers.  <br/>\nDo they not realize how much easier it would be to send my children <br/>\naway all day while I made a nice secondary income?  If I wanted to be <br/>\na slacker, and I have seen many who are, I would just shut my kids in <br/>\npreschool all day, pick them up as late as possible and then dinner <br/>\nand bed.  Now that is being a slacker!  Having my children with me <br/>\nall day, entertaining them when need be, giving up my income, etc. <br/>\nmakes me and all of us very devoted to this decision.  People assume <br/>\nwe are missing some piece of information, and it is just the <br/>\nopposite.  I have read more about schooling than any of <br/>\nmy &quot;schooling&quot; friends.  It was the same attitude when I did not want <br/>\nto vaccinate my kids. I had read more and was more knowledable, yet <br/>\nsomehow those that never questioned their doctors advice are more <br/>\nadvised than me??  Oh, well there is my tirade for the day!<br/>\n<br/>\nCOngratulations to you for sticking to it,especially with your <br/>\nsituation!
