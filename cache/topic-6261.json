They are wonderful nonfiction books...on practically every subject. My little brother who hates reading loves these books. My children and I also love these books. Yes, I sell them...but just mostly to myself and my family. LOL They do have an online catalog... <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ubah.com/cat_ubah/cat-search.asp.\">http://www.ubah.com/cat_ubah/cat-search.asp.</a> If you want suggestions about books for different subjects and age groups or if you&#39;d like to see some of the books in person, I could help you find a consultant in your area...I&#39;d be happy to help. They do sell some of the books at book stores too. But they usually have a very limited selection. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Heather <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Free voicemail and email, by phone or Web!
