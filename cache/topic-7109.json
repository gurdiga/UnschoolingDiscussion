I need your help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m writing a book on lifestyles of homeschooling families, and I&#39;m looking<br/>\nfor a wide variety of parents who are of all races, religions, and homeschool<br/>\nphilosophies, as well as from many different regions of the U.S. I am<br/>\npurposely avoiding well-known homeschoolers, preferring to write about<br/>\neveryday people. High on my priority list are homeschoolers who are Hispanic<br/>\nand/or immigrants, fathers who homeschool, observant Jews, people of other<br/>\nreligions, people who live in a large city like New York, and unschoolers, as<br/>\nI have plenty of contacts for WASP families. Would some of you be interested<br/>\nin being included as one of the &lt;&lt;stories&gt;&gt; in my book?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour part would involve answering about 50 questions, either by phone or<br/>\ne-mail, about how homeschool works in your family. I will take the answers<br/>\nand write them up as a story. Then you get a rough draft, to make sure of<br/>\naccuracy and your approval or suggestions for change. I finalize, send you a<br/>\nsecond draft, you approve and that&#39;s that. I would include the first and last<br/>\nnames of each member of your family, but no city, only a state. You may be<br/>\nasked to provide some photos.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book will be published by Kensington Publishing in New York and<br/>\ndistributed nationally. I&#39;m negotiating with my publisher so that every<br/>\nparticipating family will receive at least a couple of free copies of the<br/>\nbook, tentatively called &lt;&lt;Real-Life Homeschooling: The Stories of 25<br/>\nFamilies Who Teach Their Children at Home.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease let me know if any of you are interested in being part of this book.<br/>\nThank you in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda Barfield</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7107,"nextTopicId":7075}}
