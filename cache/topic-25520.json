My husband was a <br/>\nfirefighter in the Military until 5 years ago and we were just <br/>\nthinking how he won&#39;t get called as his reserve status was over 2 <br/>\nyears ago.  Then we began talking about all the brave people in NYC <br/>\nwho ran into those buildings to save others.  Especially this week it <br/>\nseems that some of the stuff has been petty on the list, maybe a way <br/>\nto vent frustration over the feeling of powerlessness and wondering <br/>\nwhat on earth is God&#39;s plan with all this chaos going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that for me each day is a new journey with my kids and the <br/>\nunschooling way of life.  As I let go of old behaviors in my life <br/>\nthat don&#39;t work for me personally anymore I also let go of some of <br/>\nthe old behaviors I&#39;ve had with them.  I actually told Zak yesterday <br/>\nthat if he didn&#39;t stay close to me in the library I was going to put <br/>\nhim over my knee and smack his bum infront of everyone.   Instead of <br/>\ntelling him how scarey it is for me when he takes Max in his stroller <br/>\non a tour of the library and they are both out of my sight.  Learning <br/>\nto be more honest with my kids will help me.  Later on in the day <br/>\nwhen Max was down for his nap I sat Zak down and we talked about why <br/>\nmummy had said what she said in the library.  He said &quot;but I can take <br/>\ncare of myself mummy.  IF anyone tries to hurt me I&#39;ll scream and <br/>\nkick and run away&quot;.... Maybe that would work, but the thought of him <br/>\nbeing abducted still lingers in my head.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s one day at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Sheri Piersol [mailto:sheri@m...]<br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, September 12, 2001 7:33 PM<br/>\n&gt;   To: Unschooling-dotcom@y...<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] current events<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I must admit that I too haven&#39;t really read most of the posts from<br/>\n&gt; yesterday<br/>\n&gt;   and today.

I&#39;ve been at this for 6 years, and only recently did I realize<br/>\nthat my needs counted to.  I used to just let the kids do whatever all<br/>\nday, I took them to lots of cools places and ran myself ragged working<br/>\nand going on field trips and then coming home to a mess of a house. <br/>\nThrow in a couple of major illnesses and it was not pretty.<br/>\nAnyway, I realized just recently that it is not unreasonable for me to<br/>\nexpect my teenagers to help with the house.  We sat down and discussed it<br/>\nand I talked to them about how unfair it was to Ron who came home from<br/>\nwork and did housework every night to help me.  That&#39;s when we hashed out<br/>\nthe job list that has been so pilloried here.  But untimately what has<br/>\noccurred is that they now feel like they have MORE power in the household<br/>\nand therefore more responsibility.  <br/>\nI know your children are younger than mine, but don&#39;t forget to put your<br/>\nown health and mental wellbeing into the equation when you are looking at<br/>\nwhat is working for your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~   F u cn rd ths u cnt spl wrth a dm! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nIf electricity comes from electrons . . .<br/>\n . . . does that mean that morality comes from morons?</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"discovery6@aol.com","from":"discovery6@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"LIsHR9JbMF2OklxcKZ7zfduuq5Db-g8tLg3ZQPYLBrQ-kb2kEIRmSkoimxSBAqb-OMgK9A5_awaQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] current events","postDate":"1000387506","msgId":25549,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY3LmYzNzI2ZjMuMjhkMjBkYjJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":25548,"nextInTopic":25551,"prevInTime":25548,"nextInTime":25550,"topicId":25520,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/12/2001 9:36:45 PM Central Daylight Time, sheri@maine.rr.com writes:  You","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1963474577\">In a message dated 9/12/2001 9:36:45 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheri@...\">sheri@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  need some unschooling encouragment and words of guidance &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have it.
