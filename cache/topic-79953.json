I<br/>\nforwarded that post to my daughter so she can check out the links if she<br/>\nwants to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sat with my daughter today and read to her this entire thread and all the<br/>\nreplies.  According to her, Fanfiction is a site where writers critique each<br/>\nother.  If someone wrote a story that had the wrong rating, people would be<br/>\ncomplaining almost instantly.  My daughter writes stories and people write<br/>\nwhat they think of them.  She changes her stories or keeps them the same as<br/>\nshe feels fit, but it gets her thinking about her audience, who they are and<br/>\nwhat they want.  One thing about that site is that when an author has been<br/>\ncritiqued many times, new people come to read the story, so my daughter<br/>\nsometimes critiques herself just to get people to come read her stories.  It<br/>\njust seems to me that X rated stories could find their way onto that site,<br/>\nbut they wouldn&#39;t last very long.  Plus, since new writers have to be<br/>\ncritiqued to get people to read their stories, they probably will not have<br/>\nvery many people who actually read them, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is an IM between my daughter (15) and myself, followed by email she<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sent me - about fan fiction.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (Don&#39;t laugh - yes we were IMing from different rooms in the same house -<br/>\n </span></blockquote>we do it all the time.)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; PSoroosh (10:38:07 AM): how much X-rated type of stuff do you run into on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>fanfiction.net?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; PSoroosh (10:38:19 AM): people on unschooling discussion are warning other<br/>\n </span></blockquote>parents about it.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; HarlequinPhantom (10:38:21 AM): Basically none, since the new policy...<br/>\n&gt; PSoroosh (10:38:27 AM): how about before the new policy?<br/>\n&gt; PSoroosh (10:38:29 AM): a lot?<br/>\n&gt; PSoroosh (10:38:50 AM): and - is there still stuff left there since the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>new policy?
