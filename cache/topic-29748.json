My oldest left school, at nine years <br/>\nold, at barely a second grade reading level last year.  For the <br/>\nentire summer and &quot;school&quot; year we have &quot;lived&quot;.   <br/>\n       IN THE BEGINNING...... My questions regarding unschooling and <br/>\ndeschooling popped up here a few times and everyone helped me to <br/>\nrelax...reminding me that TIME was all that was needed. Thanks to you <br/>\nall for those words of patience. Time is what I gave him. I never <br/>\ntold him to read a book.  HE NEVER PICKED A BOOK UP. He spent the day <br/>\nin a grumpy bored state when we were home. He refused to take any <br/>\nclasses, watched TV ALOT and played playstation!! He would not play <br/>\nwith toys. He had never really played with toys. We continued to <br/>\nlive....going to lots of park days and field trips with our active <br/>\nhomeschool group, which he really enjoyed.  I also took his younger <br/>\nbrother to some classes that he had picked out...a science class and <br/>\na very relaxed music class (singing and craft based)   Sometime <br/>\npassed and then Zachery (my oldest) asked to go to the music <br/>\nclass...which he now loves! Recently, Zach requested to attend a clay <br/>\nclass.  He also enjoyed it immensely and has gone a few times now.  <br/>\nHe has become a different person....I cannot explain it.  He will now <br/>\nplay with toys for hours.  DragonballZ figures and legos are his <br/>\ncurrent favorites. During the day the TV is rarely on (until <br/>\nDragonballZ at 5:30!!).   He is HAPPY and content.  Today he picked <br/>\nup &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and read it to me (two pages) He said it looked like <br/>\na cool book.  In those two pages he read words like respectable and <br/>\nconsidered with no trouble at all. Then he put the book down and went <br/>\non his way!   <br/>\n           HOW DO THEY LEARN????  They do...in their own time. It <br/>\ntook my son 6 months to find happiness and contentment....imagine <br/>\nwhat can happen in a lifetime! <br/>\n<br/>\n                               Tara</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29676,"nextTopicId":29751}}
