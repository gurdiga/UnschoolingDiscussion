We&#39;ll also be travelling the Natchez Trace from southern Mississippi to southern Tennessee and taking a look at some non-Civil War sites there, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion first:  Have you been to any CW sites that were particularly riveting that we just shouldn&#39;t miss?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond: We&#39;ve only got two weeks altogether, and will be driving from Houston to DC and back, so time is of the essence.  What would you particularly recommend in the DC area?  We just can&#39;t do the whole thing, and this is not the trip for it.  I was thinking of Ford&#39;s Theater...are there any other particular CW sites that we should visit there?  (I know....I&#39;m checking online too. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThird: Any great places to eat or stay?  We&#39;re looking at a tight budget, but can splurge once in awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nFourth:  Good scenic routes?  In particular, can anyone tell me if Interstate 81 through western Virginia is good?  I&#39;d love to be able to get off the interstates altogether and take back roads, but we just won&#39;t have the time.  The map looks like 81 goes right through the long middle of the W. Virginia mountains on the west and the Blue Ridge on the East.  Is it nice there, or have they managed to make that interstate as boring as so many others?  We will, however, be able to take back roads for select periods.  Any favorites?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your time in responding!<br/>\nLaura B.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98849,"nextTopicId":98882}}
