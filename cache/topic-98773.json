But for the moment I&#39;m on the<br/>\nWashington coast, just across the Columbia from Astoria.  Maybe sometime I<br/>\ncould make it down your way for a visit though.  I do have some friends I<br/>\nlike to see from time in Silverton.  Also, my husband and I have been<br/>\nconsidering Corvallis as a place to try and buy some land.  I appreciate the<br/>\ninvitation to spend some time with some other Oregon Unschoolers.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow when I could do that, but think I could sometime in the next few weeks.<br/>\nIn the meantime, I&#39;ll check out the link you shared with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks again!<br/>\nAndrea</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"Mary Gold","from":"&quot;Mary Gold&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Seeing unschoolers in action.","postDate":"1093451777","msgId":98850,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNnaWY2MStlcWkwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwZGYwMWM0ODk0NCQ3MTVjNDNiMCRjNWI2Y2VkMUBoZXJvbm9mZmljZT4="},"prevInTopic":98773,"nextInTopic":98865,"prevInTime":98849,"nextInTime":98851,"topicId":98773,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... for awhile.
