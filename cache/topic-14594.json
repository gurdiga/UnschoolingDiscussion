Of<br/>\ncourse us having a family bed and me being able to fall asleep during her<br/>\nnight nursings makes a huge difference. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve read somewhere<br/>\nthat the time from one year to around 18 months is a time when your child<br/>\nwill nurse like a newborn. That&#39;s certainly true with us. It could also have<br/>\na lot to do with developmental stuff, teething, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my first piece of advice for you would be to try to make the family<br/>\nbed work by putting the mattress of your bed on the floor and adding another<br/>\nmattress to it, or by placing ds&#39;s crib (I assume that&#39;s what he sleeps in)<br/>\nnext to your bed as a sidecar.

(I know, hahaha, on ever having the time to do<br/>\nanything properly!) But this post caught my eye and, while I tried to reply<br/>\nto Amy privately, either the list won&#39;t allow that or I couldn&#39;t figure it<br/>\nout, so here&#39;s a public, long-winded reply (for which I apologise, though I<br/>\nshould admit upfront that I do tend to be long-winded!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI went through a similar stage with my younger daughter (now 2.3) when she<br/>\nwas about that age. This was just around the time I transistioned her from<br/>\nour bed to a queen sized futon she shares with her older sister (5<br/>\ntomorrow!). (We went with the queen sized bed so the two could sleep<br/>\ntogether and so I could lie down with them when necessary.) It didn&#39;t seem<br/>\nat the time as if the transition had anything to do with her suddenly<br/>\nincreased night nursing, though it&#39;s possible. But she suddenly went from<br/>\n1-2 times a night to 4-5 and, like Amy, I thought I was going to go nuts and<br/>\nseriously considered night weaning her, though I&#39;d been committed to kid-led<br/>\nweaning. Well, this went on for about three weeks, during which time I never<br/>\ngot around to figuring out how I&#39;d go about the night weaning. And, lo and<br/>\nbehold, one night she slept through 12 hours from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. and has<br/>\ndone so ever since. If she wakes up in the middle of the night even twice a<br/>\nmonth that&#39;s a lot, by contrast to her sister who wakes up to come and find<br/>\nme at least five nights out of seven. (And now dd2 nurses twice a day, first<br/>\nthing in the morning and last thing before sleep, and occasionally at other<br/>\ntimes if she&#39;s stressed or bored.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of which is to say that this could well be just a stage, and you could<br/>\nwell have a happy surprise at the end of it. In hindsight, it almost seemed<br/>\nas if dd2 was stocking up on the night nursing before her big switch to<br/>\nsleeping the night through (which she had never before done, not once.) And,<br/>\nin hindsight, I&#39;m really glad I didn&#39;t interfere, but let her have what she<br/>\nneeded. I didn&#39;t cut her off, and she learned to sleep through the night all<br/>\nby herself. Of course, YMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ve really enjoyed the postings on this list since I joined and<br/>\nlook forward to more in the months and years to come.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Okay, a quick intro for those of you who are still with me -- I&#39;m Ashley ,<br/>\nmom to Willis, now 5, adopted from China at 11 months,  and Frances,<br/>\nbio-baby, age 2.3. I&#39;ve been committed to homeschooling since way before I<br/>\nhad kids, even while I was doing my teacher training at Bank Street College<br/>\nin the late 1980&#39;s. We live in rural northern California. There are a lot of<br/>\nhomeschoolers in our area, though I haven&#39;t really tapped in to the local<br/>\nnetwork yet. We&#39;re pretty unstructured at this point. I marvel at how much<br/>\nthe girls are processing and &quot;working&quot; and learning as I watch them play. I<br/>\nam very lucky in that they get along very well and are happy to play<br/>\ntogether all day long. My biggest concern at this point is finding ways to<br/>\nkeep my younger happy while I do stuff with my older. Since they do get<br/>\nalong so well, they always want to be together, and if I set up something<br/>\nfun to occupy the younger, the older wants to do it to instead of what I&#39;d<br/>\nhad in mind, and if I do something with the older, the younger wants to join<br/>\nin even if she then gets bored and wanders off. Naps are not the answer --<br/>\nif either of my kids nap they are awake till midnight, and they have planty<br/>\nof stamina to get through the day and evening without napping, so we don&#39;t<br/>\ndo naps.) This is not a huge problem; we muddle through well enough despite<br/>\nthe distractions and interruptions, but I&#39;d be interested to hear how others<br/>\nhandle this problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnough about us. I enjoy this list, and find it&#39;s helped me focus a little<br/>\nbetter on how I want to approach things. It is well worth the time -- and<br/>\nthat&#39;s saying a lot, since I have NO time!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best wishes to all of you, and good luck to Amy!<br/>\n<br/>\nAshley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since the subject of nursing has come up, I wonder if anyone else is<br/>\n&gt; having a problem with very frequent night time nursing?

Seriously, it won&#39;t kill your <br/>\nrelationship with your dh as long as you talk about it, <br/>\nkeep talking, so if there&#39;s a way for the two of you (I <br/>\nmean you child and you...) to co-sleep, then do it!  <br/>\nThey do &#39;unschool&#39; into their own beds eventually, or <br/>\nso I&#39;m told :-)  It&#39;s not abuse as long as they can <br/>\nchoose, they do naturally outgrow the need, and htey do <br/>\nhave the need.  You might find that the nursing gets <br/>\nless if he&#39;s in your bed, the company is something he <br/>\nneeds just as much.<br/>\n<br/>\nApart from that, I don&#39;t know what to suggest.  All the <br/>\nfigures, all the anecdotes, the books I&#39;ve read, the <br/>\npresentations I&#39;ve seen tell me that co-sleeping is, <br/>\nlike breastfeeding, the biological expectation of the <br/>\nchild.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the subject of nursing has come up, I wonder if <br/>\nanyone else is\u000f<br/>\nhaving a problem with very frequent night time <br/>\nnursing?\u000e My 16 mo. old\u000f<br/>\nwakes up to nurse every 2-3 hours every night like <br/>\nclockwork , and I am\u000f<br/>\ngetting so tired I&#39;m afraid to get behind the wheel to <br/>\ndrive anywhere.\u000e I\u000f<br/>\ncan&#39;t keep him in our bed because we get even less <br/>\nsleep (our bed is\u000f<br/>\nsmall) and I have talked to people who say, &quot;Let him <br/>\nnurse as much as he\u000f<br/>\nwants at night,&quot; and others (like the pediatrician) who <br/>\nsay, &quot; Cut him\u000f<br/>\noff right now or he will never learn to get to sleep on <br/>\nhis own&quot;.\u000e I\u000f<br/>\ndon&#39;t know what to do since this is the only child I&#39;ve <br/>\never nursed this\u000f<br/>\nlong (my other two were weaned earlier).\u000e\u000e I\u000e just know <br/>\nI can&#39;t go on\u000f<br/>\nlike this much longer.\u000e Any advice would be <br/>\nappreciated.+\u000e Thanks, Amy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Amy Spang","from":"Amy Spang &lt;aspang1@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"lD_wGBaVcGTMCpElZye8Y_tps-_pgv9CGK3njPLcbpVjrb-p9Dwwmmrh9Xaw9Hjj40Elp-Vqt7AtOgWRKyyaDLP9Mw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Nighttime nursing","postDate":"977157689","msgId":14594,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAxMjE4LjExNTUzMC4tMTM1NjQzLjAuYXNwYW5nMUBqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":14605,"prevInTime":14593,"nextInTime":14595,"topicId":14594,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Since the subject of nursing has come up, I wonder if anyone else is having a problem with very frequent night time nursing?

My 16 mo. old<br/>\nwakes up to nurse every 2-3 hours every night like clockwork , and I am<br/>\ngetting so tired I&#39;m afraid to get behind the wheel to drive anywhere.  I<br/>\ncan&#39;t keep him in our bed because we get even less sleep (our bed is<br/>\nsmall) and I have talked to people who say, &quot;Let him nurse as much as he<br/>\nwants at night,&quot; and others (like the pediatrician) who say, &quot; Cut him<br/>\noff right now or he will never learn to get to sleep on his own&quot;.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know what to do since this is the only child I&#39;ve ever nursed this<br/>\nlong (my other two were weaned earlier).   I  just know I can&#39;t go on<br/>\nlike this much longer.  Any advice would be appreciated.+  Thanks, Amy<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
