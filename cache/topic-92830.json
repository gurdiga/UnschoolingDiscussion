You <br/>\nare right a letter might be best in this case. I would like to try <br/>\nand still be friends with her especially since she is still weighing <br/>\nthe unschooling issue herself for her kids and herself. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut you are right, I do not value this type of behavior being shown <br/>\nin front of me or my kids, so I think a leter to her might just work <br/>\nand also giving her the website info too, that just may open her <br/>\neyes to see when spanking and sending your child to the corner just <br/>\nis wrong and why and that there are many many other effective ways <br/>\nto handle it. The website info has been a great help, I have been <br/>\nreading it off and on all day! :) I even joined Pam&#39;s No spanking <br/>\nyahoo group too! Did not know she had one! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the websites again and if anyone else has any other ideas <br/>\ntoo, please let me know.
