Maybe you could talk to your daughter about her <br/>\n&gt; specific concerns - what is it exactly that she wants from school. <br/>\n&gt; More time with friends? Different crafts and opportunities to learn? <br/>\n&gt; Riding a bus?? All of these things are things that you can arrange <br/>\n&gt; for her without also burdening her with school.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For me, school is a place where  the magic that lives inside each <br/>\n&gt; child is methodically extiguished. I want to keep the magic alive for <br/>\n&gt; my children as long as they want it to burn.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Blue Skies!<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with Robin, but had to comment, that I have seen the pre-kinderagarten<br/>\nage, girls especially,  completely bored with the homelife, and of course<br/>\ndear old MOM.  I saw this in a five year old that babysat for a couple of <br/>\nhours.<br/>\nA few hours of being included in our homeschooling projects, she didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to go home. <br/>\nHer MOM couldn&#39;t understand the concept of homeschooling, nor did she-<br/>\nnor would she have the gumption to even contemplate the idea. So, I gathered<br/>\nMOM was needing a break from her also, and she was ready for her daughter to <br/>\ngo to kindergarten.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think that if a child has an older sibling that goes to school, its almost<br/>\na give that they are conditioned early on.  By the time they are of age,<br/>\nthey have seen so many great things, plus being able to go somewhere<br/>\nevery day besided home is great....<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my daughter went to PS, I sure didn&#39;t come close to teaching her<br/>\nmuch at home, nor did I give her the attention I have recently come to<br/>\nknow through HS. And I wish I could go back and do it over.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess, sometimes one needs a good shake up much like what happened to<br/>\nme with my LD son. Theres nothing like having the PS system turn your<br/>\nchild into a complete emotional mess. Had I been able to see into the <br/>\nfuture a few years ago, I would have never put him through PS. NEVER!<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough all the tribuatlons we have encountered, I understand both sides,<br/>\nand respect the choices others make regarding the HS vs. PS issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nStac<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21424,"nextTopicId":21479}}
