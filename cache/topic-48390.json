It&#39;s more<br/>\n&gt; of a mixed bag of genres from world music to R&B to reggae to contemporary<br/>\n&gt; acoustic.  GaiaWolf&#39;s mission has to do with promoting universal harmony<br/>\n&gt; amongst species, so to that end we sing about wolves in Yellowstone, how<br/>\n&gt; drought in the Serengeti affects the elephants who live there, peace, the<br/>\n&gt; manatee, pilot whales, starting over, what the Statue of Liberty might say<br/>\n&gt; if she could talk and tell us what she&#39;s been seeing, and on and on.  If<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;d like to hear some of the music we do, you can listen for free at<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; website:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/192/ec_lorick__gaiawolf.html\">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/192/ec_lorick__gaiawolf.html</a>  My<br/>\n&gt; most favorite tune on there is Abby, Stay.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds really cool.

Do you perform often?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I play French horn.  One orchestra I&#39;m in gives 4 concerts a year.  Another<br/>\none gives a big concert in June and 3 chamber concerts during the spring.<br/>\nThis year I&#39;m going to be in all of those.  They&#39;re also doing a Christmas<br/>\nconcert, but I&#39;m not in that one.  The concert Friday night was with a<br/>\nchamber orchestra that&#39;s usually just strings.  We did a Mozart divertimento<br/>\nfor 2 horns and strings.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you do with Gaia Wolf?  Play something?  Sing?<br/>\nTia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48359,"nextTopicId":48354}}
