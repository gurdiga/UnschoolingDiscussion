She just asked me if I would stand <br/>\nat the<br/>\nboard and lecture the assignments!**<br/>\n<br/>\nEven teacher training classes in the U.S. are now advising future <br/>\nteachers that they should stop acting like &quot;the sage on the stage&quot; <br/>\n(lecturing), and be more of &quot;a guide on the side&quot; (facilitating).  (You <br/>\ncan tell her I said so.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally hate lectures and love textbooks, so I think my learning <br/>\nstyle may be quite different from you daughter&#39;s.  But if she likes <br/>\nlectures, she may also learn well from videos.   I think that the <br/>\nHistory Channel, and the Discovery channel and PBS all have websites <br/>\nwith resources for teachers that go with their various TV programs. <br/>\nPossibly even downloadable worksheets.   (How wicked is that?)  In some <br/>\nareas, community colleges broadcast some of their lecture classes.  Some <br/>\nof them are dull enough to cure insomnia, but I really like the foreign <br/>\nlanguage instruction classes that I&#39;ve seen.  (The fancy Capretz <br/>\nprograms: French in Action and Destinos.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this sounds awfully schooly.  I&#39;m not saying &quot;make her do it&quot;, <br/>\njust show her some options.  If they don&#39;t suit her, she&#39;ll drop them <br/>\npretty quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd learning whatever you can about &quot;deschooling&quot; may help, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":88143888,"authorName":"Sarah K.
