I don&#39;t WANT to  be associated <br/>\nwith all the extreme fundamentalist, dresses only, switch  swinging, textbook <br/>\ntoting homeschool types (my apologies if I offend  anyone).  I still find that <br/>\nmost people assume that if you homeschool,  it&#39;s for religious reasons.

I think a lot of people feel the same way about me and my  kids.  I&#39;ve <br/>\ncome to the conclusion that that&#39;s their problem, and they  don&#39;t have to <br/>\nhang around our family at functions if they don&#39;t want to.   But the kids in our <br/>\nhomeschool group LIKE my kids, because they&#39;re just nice  kids, friendly to <br/>\neveryone.  A few discussions have started up that could  have turned into <br/>\narguments but so far both kids have agreed not to take the  argument any further <br/>\n(religious).  <br/>\n <br/>\nNancy B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112526,"nextTopicId":112568}}
