My 19 year old is having a hard time with it. Basically he said<br/>\nsuffering the trauma of school has helped him grow. I just asked him why<br/>\nhe felt he needed to suffer to learn. He just looked away in thought. I<br/>\nadmit I am a little fearful too so we will work through it together just<br/>\nlike anything else. It is hard because on this same day - today - I<br/>\nenrolled my 14 year old with bipolar  and dyslexia in a therapuetic<br/>\nschool. The school is hands-on learning with 20 kids and 10 teachers. He<br/>\nhas learned to hate himself and feel useless and stupid at school. He is<br/>\nfull of fear and mistrust. He is so much less &quot;bipolar&quot; - stressed -<br/>\nduring the summer when he is out of school. If this doesn&#39;t work I will<br/>\nteach him at home although at time he is like grabbing a tiger by the<br/>\ntail. I feel this is it - the last straw. He just wants to quit school<br/>\nyet, will try this school. It did look cool. <br/>\nIf I had to do it all over again I would have taught them all (6) at<br/>\nhome. I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t because I am a bit &quot;outside of the box.&quot;<br/>\nMy husband didn&#39;t want me to - I hardly ever listen to him:)...

Her ideas on &quot;preschool&quot; (she <br/>\nHATES the very word) are that kids should spend most of their time home with <br/>\ntheir family, but that that coming 2 or 3 mornings a week for a couple of <br/>\nhours to a place where they can have access to lots of art supplies, big <br/>\nplayground equipment, water, dirt, animals, etc., is nice for them and maybe <br/>\na needed break for parents. Also - she figures that if kids are going to be <br/>\nin daycare and if it isn&#39;t going to be with other family members or friends, <br/>\nthat at least it ought to include FREEDOM to choose what to do with their own <br/>\ntime within the constraints imposed by being cared for as a group. In her <br/>\nprogram, nothing was compulsory and all materials and equipment were <br/>\navailable all the time for any child to use as they wished.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was brought up with these ideas so that they seem self-evident to me. And, <br/>\nI easily moved beyond my mom - I could never see any good reason why &quot;school&quot; <br/>\nshould be any different from her &quot;preschool&quot; and it was really easy for me to <br/>\nrecognize the deep human truth of the unschooling philosophy -- it was a <br/>\nlogical next step.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - she&#39;s fought an uphill battle for more than 3 decades - and it is <br/>\ngetting harder and harder.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41247,"nextTopicId":41182}}
