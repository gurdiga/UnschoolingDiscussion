I love having you wise mentors out there who have gone down this path, be it the emotional or political or family or dinosaur path!   I am going to have so much fun tommorow with Jesse exploring the links you all posted about state dinosaurs and Jack Horner, etc.  Jesse says he wants to be a paleontologist.  He creates digs for himself at the farm and has me read him every book on dinosaurs we can find at the library.  He carries around a small but very thick dinosaur encyclopedia  and talks about all of their traits and who they lived with in which periods and has us tell him about any he doesn&#39;t know, again and again. He creates long stories about them with a felt board and plays with his dino figures for hours. I will miss this passion of his for dinosaurs.  Maybe I&#39;ll get lucky and it will last another few years.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe were at our Atlanta science museum (Fernbank) last week and there was a kid  there volunteering whom I had noticed there a month earlier. He was about 11 yrs. old. Jesse asked him all kinds of questions about the T.Rex tooth he had in his display.   I asked him about the volunteer position, thinking he might be a home schooler.  He said he was doing the volunteering in order to have it on his record so he could get in a good school.  My heart sank.  I asked if he had any interest in dinosaurs and he said, &quot;Well, I like animals and dinosaurs are O.K.&quot;    It&#39;s not as if he isn&#39;t going to learn a lot from this volunteering but i just felt sad that what motivates so many kids (or kids&#39; parents) once they are in the system of &quot;education&quot; is getting further in the system, not learning for the sake of learning but getting further.    Didn&#39;t mean to go off about that.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMadeline<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**Aaaah, but did you know there is an unschoolish sort of twist to the whole Maiasaura thing?  The Paleontologist that discovered Maiasaura, Jack Horner, famous for the whole &quot;egg mountain&quot; thing, never got his degree.
