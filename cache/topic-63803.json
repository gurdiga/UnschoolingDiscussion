From what I know and see here, 12 year olds<br/>\n  having sex is the norm. The ones who aren&#39;t having some kind of sexual<br/>\n  contact are the ones shunned and made fun of. It&#39;s pretty much a gimme that<br/>\n  by 13 or 14, if you haven&#39;t had sex with someone, you are weird. And let me<br/>\n  say that most kids start out with oral sex. See around here, oral sex ISN&#39;T<br/>\n  sex at all and the way to start out when experimenting. And this goes both<br/>\n  ways, for guys and girls.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;Here&#39;s a good question... what age do you think is an OK age to start<br/>\n  having<br/>\n  sexual relationships?  Or is it when that person feels ready and can be<br/>\n  responsible?  Does a mother EVER think it&#39;s OK?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think it would be fair for me to put an age on it. It would depend<br/>\n  on the person and the circumstances. I love sex and it&#39;s a big part of my<br/>\n  marital relationship. It&#39;s always been a big part of my life. I haven&#39;t<br/>\n  always been careful about it and that has to do with me not getting any<br/>\n  information when I was young. I make sure not to do that with my own<br/>\n  children. But I think it&#39;s fun and not just for procreation. I have married<br/>\n  friends who complain about not enough, about too much. I have friends who go<br/>\n  weeks without sex. I know of some who actually go years. That would never<br/>\n  work for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So with my attitude, how could I expect my children to not have sex until<br/>\n  they are legal adults or married. They might choose to do that, and that&#39;s<br/>\n  fine if it&#39;s their choice. If it&#39;s not, how can I complain about it?<br/>\n<br/>\n  My oldest had sex earlier than I was comfortable with. Now she knows it was<br/>\n  way too soon for her also. Can&#39;t take it back and luckily there were<br/>\n  repercussions because of it. She&#39;s careful now about her decisions. I also<br/>\n  know her and her boyfriend now are having sex. And even though I had a<br/>\n  problem with how and when she started, I don&#39;t have any problems with her<br/>\n  now. She&#39;s responsible and she loves the kid. Not someone she will marry,<br/>\n  but I don&#39;t believe it has to wait for that anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Near her 13th birthday the girl became <br/>\npregnant by the boy she was IN LOVE with.  The boy her mother let her have in <br/>\nher room with the door shut and sleep together (but they were only SLEEPING). <br/>\n So her mother takes care of the situation and gets the girl a babysitter <br/>\nafter school.  She can&#39;t go anywhere, do anything, has to be monitored at all <br/>\ntimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMother calls me, asks me how come Cait is not like Tara? Apologizes that Tara <br/>\nhas exposed these kids to things their parents might not approve of.  <br/>\n(annoucing her pregnancy to her friends they all had to find out why it never <br/>\nprogressed).<br/>\n<br/>\nI just took a deep breath and said, you know what?  I don&#39;t go out for drinks <br/>\nafter work and come home at nine or ten or later every night and fall into <br/>\nbed.  I don&#39;t agree with Cait taking a boyfriend (she doesn&#39;t have one yet) <br/>\ninto her room to &quot;sleep&quot; at that age, especially with no one home.  I told <br/>\nher this has been going on for a couple years, it&#39;s not something new to her <br/>\nchild.  She really wanted help, she wanted to know what she could do as a <br/>\nmother to help her child see that she wasn&#39;t adult enough to go through all <br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about not MAKING her the adult?  She comes home from seventh grade like <br/>\nadults come home from work.  To an empty house.  She is repsonsible for her <br/>\nown snacks and dinner.  She is repsonsible for doing any household work that <br/>\nneeds doing, she is repsonsible for her own bedtime her own everything.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s playing house all on her own.
