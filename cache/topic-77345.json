She was a House Sparrow hatched and fledged in June and a<br/>\n  regular at our feeder.  She used to try to sip from the humming bird<br/>\n  feeder and we delighted in her.   Her parents live in the far end of our<br/>\n  clothesline pole and are raising a new brood of nestlings. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Dylan&#39;s friends played in the sprinkler and bounced on the trampoline in<br/>\n  the sunshine while he held this little bird and stroked her soft wings.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Last Tuesday his friend found an injured Kildeer.  The bird had become<br/>\n  entangled in a roll of forgotten barbed wire and in her struggles to get<br/>\n  free the skin was torn from her left leg.   Dylan&#39;s friend didn&#39;t know<br/>\n  where to take her so she brought her to us.   It was late, we couldn&#39;t<br/>\n  find a vet, we couldn&#39;t get the biologist, we couldn&#39;t get the woman at<br/>\n  Wildlife rehab.   We did the best we could, without suture needles, using<br/>\n  dental floss and antibiotic powder we carefully sewed her leg back<br/>\n  together.   Later the biologist told us not to do anything because we&#39;d<br/>\n  send her into shock and kill her.  She said Killdeer never survive in<br/>\n  captivity and she would either die from her wounds or shock or<br/>\n  starvation/dehydration.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  We let her go Sunday where she was found.  She seemed happy to have her<br/>\n  stitches out and to be a free bird again.  She didn&#39;t know she was<br/>\n  supposed to die, I guess.   <br/>\n<br/>\n  Dylan&#39;s painting a rock to mark the spot where we buried the little House<br/>\n  Sparrow. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Deb L<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
