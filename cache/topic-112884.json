The fun details are for  <br/>\nthis list, not for a &quot;serious blog.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI left a post that might or might not go through.  I should&#39;ve cut it  <br/>\nto show here, but basically I told about Kirby being offered a job  <br/>\nwhen he turned 14 and Marty being offered a job when he was 15.  (I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t say he had been offered a job too where Kirby worked, but he  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to work with Kirby, which was a decent decision to make;  <br/>\nKirby wouldn&#39;t have been as happy.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEach is on his second job now, having applied for jobs at job-change  <br/>\ntime.  Well...  Kirby applied for two and turned one down; both said  <br/>\nyes.  One, at a video gaming shop said Yes PLEASE!  Now! but he said  <br/>\nno.  I was disappointed and said so.  I said we had prepared him his  <br/>\nwhole LIFE to work in a video gaming store, and he wasn&#39;t fulfilling  <br/>\nhis potential.  But no, he didn&#39;t care what his parents thought he  <br/>\nshould do.  He went to work at a pizza place that required a uniform  <br/>\nand a haircut, rather than at the cool place where his hair could&#39;ve  <br/>\nbeen long and he could&#39;ve continued to wear gaming shirts as he had  <br/>\nfor years.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty has twice been chatted up by the deli manager at the big  <br/>\ngrocery store where he works.  The first time she commented on how  <br/>\ncheerful and happy he always seemed to be.  The next time it was  <br/>\nabout how fast and hard he worked.  He said last week she asked him  <br/>\nhow old he was.  He said 17 and her face fell.  She asked when he  <br/>\nwould be 18.  That&#39;s the minimum hire age for her department.   But  <br/>\nMarty wants to go into the police academy when he&#39;s 21 (I didn&#39;t tell  <br/>\nthat at the anti-unschooling discussion) and is thinking of going to  <br/>\ncollege first.  That&#39;s not about getting a job, though.  That&#39;s about  <br/>\nMarty. &lt;g&gt;  And unschoolers just think the stories of their lives are  <br/>\nall about THEM.

I read the resumes; I check the references. How would I react to the word &quot;unschooling&quot; on a resume?

They are willing to jump into any task or new learning experience without trepidition. They ask questions when needed. They look for answers to problems instead of waiting for others to guide them. Who wouldn&#39;t want a worker like this? And no, I don&#39;t hire people to work for a fast food restaurant; I hire people to work for a company that has a world-wide customer base and is dependant upon technology, engineering, and knowledge of global markets.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also had the opportunity to meet many young people with GEDs and public school diplomas in an adult literacy program.
