Satori, who just<br/>\nturned three last Sunday,  has acquired the lovely habit of hitting me and<br/>\ntelling me to &quot;Shut up&quot;. It happened again today and I&#39;m ashamed to admit it<br/>\nwas all I could do to keep myself from hauling off and belting him! I really<br/>\nam working on parenting consciously, and luckily I was able to control the<br/>\nimpulse.  But If I had ever hit my mother I doubt I&#39;d have lived to see my<br/>\nnext birthday and it is hard to overcome that early training,  I really do<br/>\nwant to raise him in a loving way, without fear and violence. I do not think<br/>\nit is OK to hit a child.<br/>\nHowever, he does need to know that this behavior is unacceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\n On a purely practical level, this kid is going to be bigger than me one day<br/>\nand I really think it makes sense that he knows NOW that it is not OK to hit<br/>\npeople smaller than ourselves.<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have guns here in Japan but there are way too many stories in the<br/>\nnews of teenage boys going after their parents with knives or baseball bats.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I have dealt with it so far is, if we&#39;re at home I have him  sit in<br/>\nhis chair until we both cool off. He sits in the chair willingly, I think he<br/>\nrealizes that we both need to take a moment, maybe more me than him. If we<br/>\nare out (which is when it happens more often, BTW) he gets one warning along<br/>\nthe lines of &quot;It is not OK to hit/say &quot;shut up&quot;. If he does it again, we<br/>\nleave immediately and go home.<br/>\nI&#39;m frustrated, it seems to keep happening in spite of my efforts....I&#39;ve<br/>\nhad the suggestion from several people that I should not give him a warning,<br/>\nbut go home immediately the first time he does it. That seems very coercive<br/>\nto me, and I&#39;m really interested to see how this can be dealt with from an<br/>\nunschooling point of view.<br/>\ngrrrr...he doesn&#39;t hit other kids or his father, just me. Gee I am soooo<br/>\nlucky that I&#39;m the one he can express his negative feelings to. This is not<br/>\nfun. I am making an big effort not to hit him (please don&#39;t slam me for<br/>\nadmitting that it is an effort) and here I am getting pummeled.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else dealt with this problem and what did you do about it? Is<br/>\nthis perhaps a situation where I do need to &quot;control&quot; him?<br/>\n<br/>\nHikaru</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56766,"nextTopicId":56749}}
