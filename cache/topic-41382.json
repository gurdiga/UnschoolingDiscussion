What is their expectation for<br/>\nchildren who take it? Do all the children in the school system take them?<br/>\nWho scores the tests? How long do they take to return the test and the<br/>\nresults to you? (they probably don&#39;t)  Do they return the test to you with<br/>\nthe correct answers marked and any mistakes noted? (most likely not)  If<br/>\nnot, then what good is it to you as your child&#39;s teacher, and what good was<br/>\nthe test to the child if s/he never finds out the right answers and which<br/>\nquestions were missed?

What are the consequences of<br/>\nnot getting a passing score if the kid is IN school? What are the<br/>\nconsequences for those who homeschool? (exactly, please)<br/>\n<br/>\nWho will see the scores? How will they be used? Will the school let you (the<br/>\nparent) administer the test, and keep the score only for your own<br/>\ninformation? Why not? Whose business is it, and why? What will they do with<br/>\nit, and why?  What other information is on the test, such as parents&#39; names,<br/>\nfamily income, residence, occupation, own guns? What religion/ What race?<br/>\nAre there psychological profiling questions on the test? (yes) What are<br/>\nthose used for? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe tests are to rate the schools, not the children. The scores (generated<br/>\nby machines or a distant marking service of suspicious integrity) are used<br/>\nto tell the state dept. of ed. which schools are performing better/worse<br/>\nthan others in order to justify giving them all more of our tax money.
