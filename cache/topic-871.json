There is a mountain of material on homeschooling in general, but<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s hard to find some clear, quality unschooling support.  Not only are<br/>\n&gt;there essays and FAQs and message boards, there is a mail list!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If those message boards fill up with things which aren&#39;t unschooling related,<br/>\n&gt;or if the mailing list goes off on structured-learning tangents and doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;come back, it will be harder for people to get the focussed support they<br/>\n&gt;should be able to expect in an area called unschooling.com.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There are lots of people on this list and I&#39;m glad of it, and I don&#39;t work<br/>\n&gt;for the forum, I&#39;m just someone on the list.  But as others have inquired of<br/>\n&gt;me as though they think I might be able to redirect the flow of these<br/>\n&gt;mailings, I am bravely going to ask that conversations which encourage<br/>\n&gt;structured learning over unschooling be minimized or eliminated and that<br/>\n&gt;conversations which have nothing to do with either of those be taken to<br/>\n&gt;private e-mail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now someone who actually works on the forum might come along and ask me to<br/>\n&gt;quit asking anyone to change anything, but that&#39;s a risk I&#39;ll take for the<br/>\n&gt;sake of helping keep this list fascinating and useful for the unschoolers who<br/>\n&gt;might sign on just now as I&#39;m writing this, or next weekend when a bunch of<br/>\n&gt;us are away, or next month.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d also ask that the most experienced homeschoolers among us go and post<br/>\n&gt;something in the message boards at www.unschooling.com at least once a week,<br/>\n&gt;if not more.   If we spend all our energy here we won&#39;t be building as<br/>\n&gt;glorious a life-changing resource on the internet.   We can keep children in<br/>\n&gt;distant states from suffering the indignity of being put through school at<br/>\n&gt;home if we provide their parents with inspiring alternative information.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sandra Dodd<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Check it out!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33447,"nextTopicId":33390}}
