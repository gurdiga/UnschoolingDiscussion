Taxes are lower since you don&#39;t have city water, <br/>\nsewer, garbage, community service, library, etc. So we have well and <br/>\nseptic, contract out for garbage, and pay extra for the park <br/>\ndistrict activities and pay for a library card. It&#39;s still cheaper <br/>\nthan city taxes. It&#39;s still a little countryish but city is right <br/>\naround the corner. We always tell people we live on the edge of town <br/>\nwith the witches and the trolls!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Every moment spent in unhappiness is a moment of<br/>\n&gt;    happiness lost.&quot; -- Leo Buscaglia </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Unschooling space","postDate":"1107793055","msgId":103170,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU5LjIwYjdiOGEyLjJmMzhlZTlmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":103197,"prevInTime":103169,"nextInTime":103171,"topicId":103170,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/7/05 8:49:41 AM, treegoddess@comcast.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-286416033\">In a message dated 2/7/05 8:49:41 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:treegoddess@...\">treegoddess@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Ann,<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you mean by &quot;unincorporated&quot;?
