I am one for whom manners go<br/>\nhand in hand with respect for others.  Maybe I am old fashioned, but I like<br/>\nit that way.  I send thank you notes, I encourage my children to be polite<br/>\nand respectful to their friends and each other, we say thank you, please,<br/>\nyour welcome and I&#39;m sorry to each other in this house.  That means adults<br/>\nto each other, children to each other, and adults to children or vice<br/>\nversa.  Respecting others&#39; boundaries and differences doesn&#39;t stop at the<br/>\ndoor, either.  I try to instill in my children the rightness of treating<br/>\nothers well and being &quot;good&quot; to people.  Sometimes a little bit of kindness<br/>\ncan work wonders for someone, and you may even make a stranger&#39;s day.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1925,"nextTopicId":1908}}
