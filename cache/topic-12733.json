All within an easy<br/>\n&gt; drive we have seven rivers, 2 lakes, five lagoons, about half a million<br/>\n&gt; acres in state and national parks, miles and miles of play upon ocean<br/>\n&gt; beaches, a bay that is calm enough for kayaking and skulling, a zoo in the<br/>\n&gt; middle of town and rural enough that we have beer, racoons, fox and<br/>\n&gt; occasionally a bear that wander through city streets.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lynda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12730,"nextTopicId":12441}}
