And, you are <br/>\nabsolutely right, I meant nothing &quot;against&quot; FIAR.    I have not done much <br/>\nresearch on FIAR, but from what this mother said, it is a big step AWAY from <br/>\nstructured lessons for her family.  Her son loves to read and he is enjoying FIAR, <br/>\nespecially in comparison to doing &quot;school at home- very structured lessons&quot;   I <br/>\ntalked to this mother about unschooling, the things we do, and don&#39;t do.  And <br/>\nfor her, it seemed a bit TOO radical.  But, the thing is, as we get to know <br/>\nthem better, maybe spend more time with them, they may begin to move closer to <br/>\nunschooling as they see that it really does work!   The best way to <br/>\ndemonstrate and convince folks that something is valuable is through modeling and BEING <br/>\nit.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSome folks unschool from the beginning, never sending thier kids to ps or <br/>\ndoing school at home.  Some folks send thier kids to ps school for  years, then <br/>\ndecide to take them out and homeschool them.  Some familes homeschool from the <br/>\nbeginning, but they do school at home.   For the folks that start out either <br/>\nin public school, or doing school at home, sometimes they make a flying leap to <br/>\nunschooling and just go &quot;cold turkey&quot;  lol..   Others will take smaller steps <br/>\ngoing from structured lessons, to relaxed lessons, to eclectic style, to <br/>\n&quot;modified unschooling&quot; to full fledged unschooling.    We  have to meet each <br/>\nperson where they are, and help support and guide them from there.    To me, for <br/>\nyou to say that you love FIAR means that you are moving away from &quot;boxed <br/>\ncurriculum -structured lessons&quot;    It is a step closer to unschooling.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOne major key here is that you said that YOU love FIAR-- How do your kids <br/>\nlike it?   If given the choice, would they do FIAR on thier own?, without your <br/>\ndirection or requirements?  Maybe they would chose FIAR over other curriculums <br/>\nthat you have used, and in comparison to them, they &quot;love&quot; FIAR..  Think of the <br/>\nthings your kids really love to do, things that bring them joy, passion, <br/>\nexcitment.. Would they chose FIAR over these things?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79240,"nextTopicId":79265}}
