The income from the talks was erratic, he felt unfulfilled, and his<br/>\n&gt; wife was tired of having him around the house feeling that way, so after<br/>\n&gt; that time he got a job in some factory. Just wanted to keep the so-called<br/>\n&gt; record straight. (I wonder why he feels more fulfilled working in a<br/>\nfactory<br/>\n&gt; than doing half the work of caring for seven four-year-olds and one older<br/>\n&gt; child, only two of whom are in part-time school, but that&#39;s part of the<br/>\nbig<br/>\n&gt; questions about why &quot;men&#39;s work&quot; is valued more than &quot;women&#39;s work&quot;.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; About the four-year-old septuplets climbing up high and so on:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wasn&#39;t especially alarmed about their climbing. My two-year-old climbs<br/>\n&gt; like that. I couldn&#39;t see how sharp the knives were, so don&#39;t know whether<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &#39;d let him &quot;run around&quot; with them. Couldn&#39;t really tell whether the kids<br/>\n&gt; standing on the table were actually trying to swing on the chandelier or<br/>\n&gt; just swinging it back and forth. I missed the road work scene. I think<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; if you invited camera crew into almost any house with small children in<br/>\nit,<br/>\n&gt; they could splice together some pretty alarming-looking stunts. If that<br/>\n&gt; footage wasn&#39;t possible to record, I&#39;d wonder whether the parents weren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; holding back too much of that youthful daring. Maybe the proof is in the<br/>\n&gt; pudding - with seven kids having reached the age of four years, there&#39;s<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n&gt; only been one broken finger and one set of stitches. Not such a bad<br/>\nrecord,<br/>\n&gt; compared to what I&#39;ve heard around the neighborhood from parents with just<br/>\n&gt; one kid in their care.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; About the mother&#39;s &quot;whining and sniveling&quot; on TV because some in the media<br/>\n&gt; have questioned whether it is a good idea to bring into the world children<br/>\n&gt; who may be disabled (two of the septuplets have cerebral palsy):<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You seem to be saying that once you&#39;ve sold your privacy to the media, you<br/>\n&gt; can no longer react to what they say about you and your family. To me, it<br/>\n&gt; seems worse to sell your privacy plus your right to express yourself than<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; just sell yur privacy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; About the references to &quot;spare the rod, spoil the child&quot;:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree with you. As someone who struggles not to hit my son, it always<br/>\n&gt; bothers me to see people who don&#39;t struggle with it at all, but instead<br/>\n&gt; consider it a duty. I feel compassion for any parent living with<br/>\nseptuplets,<br/>\n&gt; and could understand if they struggled not to hit and lost that struggle<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; occasion, but I hate it when they simply feel completely justified in<br/>\ndoing<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; About the more general question of whether they were right to take<br/>\nfertility<br/>\n&gt; drugs, or to carry all seven babies to term:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I dunno, I guess I prefer adoption.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Overall:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t catch the beginning of the segment, so I may have missed key<br/>\n&gt; points.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Elsa Haas<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Lynda [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 2:10 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Topics From Dateline<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That family where the woman took fertility drugs and had 7 children.

They are <br/>\nanother form of sensationalism. Of shocking for <br/>\nentertainment in the guise of information. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey have their angle on every story and carefully control what they <br/>\nshow for maximum effect. Not for unbiased reporting or investigative <br/>\njournalism. It should come with a disclaimer- &quot;this <br/>\nshow is for entertainment purposes only&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t personally find it entertaining. Obviously I&#39;m in the minority <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s still on the air. I don&#39;t have any problem with anybody <br/>\nelse watching it. I think they realize it&#39;s manufactured <br/>\nto a degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe that the show would want to capture an honest picture <br/>\nof how the family is. I am not claiming the family is made of saints <br/>\n(or actually to know anything about them at all), only that we cannot <br/>\nknow their whole situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just like the doctor with the spot story. It is hearsay used to <br/>\npromote the reporter&#39;s story. There may or may not be any actual facts.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo instead of arguing about the family, or doctor&#39;s, facts we could <br/>\nremember that we will never know the facts. We will know our own <br/>\nexperiences with similar situations of course, that&#39;s <br/>\nprobably what the discussion is really about. It is helpful to share <br/>\nthem as facts in your personal experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s knock off the defensiveness, sarcasm, name calling, and all that <br/>\nbecause it gets the list nowhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll that lead by example stuff is true, we&#39;re not going to get someone <br/>\nto change their mind about corporal punishment by suggesting they&#39;re on <br/>\nthe wrong list. Give examples of how other <br/>\nideas work for your family, without calling the hitter a boob. People <br/>\nare open to change/new ideas when they feel safe to voice their <br/>\nconcerns and get help. Whacking them with righteous <br/>\nindignation will not change anyone&#39;s mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if everyone who is mad about anything I just posted can reply with <br/>\na thoughtful alternative view if they really disagree with the general <br/>\nidea of what I&#39;ve said. No personal accusations, <br/>\nname calling, sarcasm, slightly paranoid ego trips (taking this as an <br/>\nattack on only yourself), or defending ghosts (those who are offended <br/>\nbut haven&#39;t spoken for themselves out of fear). <br/>\n<br/>\nKathy B.<br/>\nhaving perhaps committed all the sins she now rails against.<br/>\n<br/>\nps- any hate stuff (anywhere in life) really is unproductive. It boils <br/>\ndown to not taking others so personally because their words, and <br/>\nactions are all about them, not you.

The income from the talks was erratic, he felt unfulfilled, and his<br/>\nwife was tired of having him around the house feeling that way, so after<br/>\nthat time he got a job in some factory. Just wanted to keep the so-called<br/>\nrecord straight. (I wonder why he feels more fulfilled working in a factory<br/>\nthan doing half the work of caring for seven four-year-olds and one older<br/>\nchild, only two of whom are in part-time school, but thats part of the big<br/>\nquestions about why mens work is valued more than womens work.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the four-year-old septuplets climbing up high and so on:<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasnt especially alarmed about their climbing. My two-year-old climbs<br/>\nlike that. I couldnt see how sharp the knives were, so dont know whether I<br/>\nd let him run around with them. Couldnt really tell whether the kids<br/>\nstanding on the table were actually trying to swing on the chandelier or<br/>\njust swinging it back and forth. I missed the road work scene. I think that<br/>\nif you invited camera crew into almost any house with small children in it,<br/>\nthey could splice together some pretty alarming-looking stunts. If that<br/>\nfootage wasnt possible to record, Id wonder whether the parents werent<br/>\nholding back too much of that youthful daring. Maybe the proof is in the<br/>\npudding  with seven kids having reached the age of four years, theres been<br/>\nonly been one broken finger and one set of stitches. Not such a bad record,<br/>\ncompared to what Ive heard around the neighborhood from parents with just<br/>\none kid in their care.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the mothers whining and sniveling on TV because some in the media<br/>\nhave questioned whether it is a good idea to bring into the world children<br/>\nwho may be disabled (two of the septuplets have cerebral palsy):<br/>\n<br/>\nYou seem to be saying that once youve sold your privacy to the media, you<br/>\ncan no longer react to what they say about you and your family. To me, it<br/>\nseems worse to sell your privacy plus your right to express yourself than to<br/>\njust sell yur privacy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the references to spare the rod, spoil the child:<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you. As someone who struggles not to hit my son, it always<br/>\nbothers me to see people who dont struggle with it at all, but instead<br/>\nconsider it a duty. I feel compassion for any parent living with septuplets,<br/>\nand could understand if they struggled not to hit and lost that struggle on<br/>\noccasion, but I hate it when they simply feel completely justified in doing<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the more general question of whether they were right to take fertility<br/>\ndrugs, or to carry all seven babies to term:<br/>\n<br/>\nI dunno, I guess I prefer adoption.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall:<br/>\n<br/>\nI didnt catch the beginning of the segment, so I may have missed key<br/>\npoints.<br/>\n<br/>\nElsa Haas<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Lynda [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 2:10 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Topics From Dateline<br/>\n<br/>\nThat family where the woman took fertility drugs and had 7 children.

I have no idea<br/>\n&gt; what the context is here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2)  For those that run daycares or have foster children:  How long would<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;be before CPS/CWS appeared on your doorstep (remember these are mainly 3<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt;4 year old) if someone called in and said or they saw as a sound bite on<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;nightly news that a) you had removed all the handles from the windows of<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bedrooms of 8 children, all of which are on the second floor and then<br/>\nhidden<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the handles; b) children standing on top of toys that are as tall or<br/>\ntaller<br/>\n&gt; &gt;than the railing on a second floor balcony; c) children running around<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; &gt;knives (not butter knives, sharp knives); d) children playing Cirque du<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Soleil from the chandelier; e) children running around unsupervised<br/>\nthrough<br/>\n&gt; &gt;road construction; f) mom taking a switch away from a small child saying,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;that&#39;s only for mommy and daddy to use.&quot;?  And a dozen other things but<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt;blanked half of them out I was so floored by it all.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;3)  Since they made a few references to homeschooling these children, how<br/>\n&gt; &gt;soon before we get some backlash from the media over the grinning fool<br/>\n&gt; &gt;talking about &quot;the Bible says &#39;spare the rod, spoil the child&#39;&quot; as an<br/>\nexcuse<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for using a switch on toddlers when asked about discipline.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Who *are* these people?
