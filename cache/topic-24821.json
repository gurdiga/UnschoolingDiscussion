I had a situation where I thought my BIL & SIL <br/>\nmight be thinking about homeschooling, so I sent some links to them. They <br/>\nhave two year old twins.  Turns out they are now in &quot;pre-school&quot;. But, here <br/>\nis the key . . . the mom has some serious mental illness problems, and I <br/>\nthink it is probably better that these kids do go to school. The very sad <br/>\nthing is that BIL does not need to work. . . they have a trust fund that <br/>\nsupports them, but he does work. . . doing church work for inner city kids, a <br/>\nvery noble thing, but meanwhile his own kids are in emotional neglect, and <br/>\nsometime physical neglect. Anyway, my point is, the information is given, <br/>\nwith no attachments to the results. <br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"NumoAstro@aol.com","from":"NumoAstro@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"dusiIfSMN6gp-zdA3m_ioFu-HG_K9dQtBX-1qFfQBoavtDi-XRb0S8yMXur_5rV-X1vzLr5acl4","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Turning people onto unschooling","postDate":"1000048936","msgId":24821,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgxLmZiZTc1NWEuMjhjY2UzMjhAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":24867,"prevInTime":24820,"nextInTime":24822,"topicId":24821,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/9/01 7:39:53 AM US Mountain Standard Time, ...

When I&#39;m talking to clients and they have <br/>\nchildren I always ask them what they are hoping to achieve by putting their <br/>\nchildren in institutions?

I usually tell them, it&#39;s <br/>\njust something to think about.  I remember that movie with Billy Crystal and <br/>\nMeg Ryan where he said &quot;it&#39;s out there, you&#39;ve already said it, you can&#39;t <br/>\ntake it back, because it&#39;s out there&quot;...
