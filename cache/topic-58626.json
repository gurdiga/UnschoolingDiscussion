And many of those things were not things I would&#39;ve <br/>\nthought of intuitively myself! I might not have set up sensory <br/>\ntables and obstacle courses and tried &quot;the kid sandwich&quot; if I hadn&#39;t <br/>\nfound the label, and thus the resources to help my kid. And this was <br/>\na kid whose &quot;specialness&quot; was making his own life very difficult. <br/>\nAll I wanted to do was to find ways to make it better and easier for <br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I would have focused <br/>\n&gt; on my needs, rather than hers, I know in my heart that her <br/>\n </span></blockquote>developing <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; trust in me and the world would have suffered and in the long run <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; trust would have to be reestablished before she would have been <br/>\n </span></blockquote>able get <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; beyond the very behaviors that were causing the problems.

I don&#39;t think I was suggesting we focus on the mother&#39;s <br/>\nneeds and not the child&#39;s.

There are lots of people on this list <br/>\nwho post excellent advice without descending to that, and many of <br/>\nthose people responded to the original poster in this thread. Now, <br/>\nsure, she did go overboard with the sarcasm in response to Sandra&#39;s <br/>\npost. But everyone gets their hackles up every now and then, and <br/>\nsomeone who is dealing daily with the situation she described <br/>\nprobably has very little patience to go around if she&#39;s <br/>\nconcentrating on giving that much of it to her kids.

Being sensitive to light is one thing. Not <br/>\nbeing able to go out of a darkened house is on the extreme end. <br/>\nParenting the extreme can be exhausting and difficult, and I do <br/>\nthink it helps to be able to talk about it and listen to others who <br/>\nhave found ways to parent these extreme kids and still respect them. <br/>\nEspecially because most of the literature, support groups, etc. out <br/>\nthere is not child-respecting, concentrates more on the labels than <br/>\non the individual kids, and is usually mostly concerned with <br/>\nnavigating the school system.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, for me it really helped to hear about the &quot;label&quot; (which <br/>\nin our case was SID) because it helped me to understand the ways in <br/>\nwhich the intense reactions to stimulus in kids who are on the <br/>\nextreme end of the sensory integration continuum come through in <br/>\ntheir behavior. It helped me to understand the things I could change <br/>\nin our environment that made a big difference. Otherwise, I might <br/>\nnot have know that a child who hated any kind of touch would <br/>\nactually crave deep touch - voila, I tried it and it worked for my <br/>\nkid. I do think that the sharing of ways in which people have <br/>\nparented, and most especially shared an unschooling life with, their <br/>\nextreme kids can be really helpful to others who are on the early <br/>\npart of that journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that in a way, the &quot;label&quot; can help a child understand <br/>\nthemselves. I too have some extreme sensory issues, and I have a <br/>\nvery clear memory of believing as a child that I was an alien from <br/>\nanother planet who had come to earth and inhabited a human body, and <br/>\nwas adopted by my parents. I had no other way to explain why I felt <br/>\nand saw and heard things so differently from other humans. I&#39;m glad <br/>\nthat I can explain to my child a little more plainly why, exactly, <br/>\nhis body feels so different from others, and the things we can work <br/>\non that will make it easier for him. At least maybe he&#39;ll never feel <br/>\nlike he&#39;s a martian.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;OTOH, I get easily overwhelmed by sound, and kids who talk their<br/>\n&gt; way through things as they figure them out really wear me out.

It&#39;s all a<br/>\ncontinuum, and the fit between the child and his environment seems to<br/>\nmake the most difference, IME. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Rain was 4 or so she insisted on wearing socks all the time. She<br/>\nslept in socks, she wore socks with sandals, she went swimming with socks<br/>\non sometimes. She just couldn&#39;t bear the feeling of anything on her feet<br/>\nexcept socks (and not ust any socks, but that&#39;s another story).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was 5 and 6 she would get angry at me for things that had<br/>\nhappened years ago (things that hadn&#39;t been as issue when they<br/>\nhappened... she&#39;d just latch on to something) and rage for an hour or<br/>\nmore, kicking, spitting, hitting... and she was a big kid, 60 pounds or<br/>\nso. I felt like I was walking on eggshells for a year or more, to keep<br/>\nfrom setting her off, and it didn&#39;t help that I had such a hard time<br/>\nfiguring out what was *really* setting her off. <br/>\n<br/>\nI worked as a special ed teacher, with kids who had been labeled as<br/>\nhaving emotional and behavioral disabilities. A lot of what I saw with<br/>\nthem was the same kind of stuff I saw with Rain during some stages - and<br/>\nin both cases, when I was able to change the environment the kids had an<br/>\neasier time, although it didn&#39;t happen right away and it wasn&#39;t perfect.<br/>\nStill, it helps me to just think of all of the kids in my life as<br/>\nindividuals, and see what they need. It seems odd to me to do things any<br/>\nother way.<br/>\n<br/>\nRain is incredibly easy to live with now, which blows my mind ever time I<br/>\nthink of her at 6. OTOH, there are a couple of kids in the play she&#39;s<br/>\ndoing now who would probably be labeled in a school setting. One needs a<br/>\npartner, because she has a harder time learning to steps and remembering<br/>\nwhere to go when. The other needs more responsibilities, because if he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have something to do, he finds himself something, and it&#39;s not<br/>\nalways a helpful thing. So he&#39;s the one the rest of the ensemble takes<br/>\ntheir cues from; he leads them on and off stage. He also had trouble with<br/>\nhow his costume felt, so we were able to switch his for a different one<br/>\n(they all look the same to me, but clearly they feel different).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the other kids in the show need different kinds of help. The<br/>\nyoungest kids are 5 and 6, and they need more help with their<br/>\ncostumes.The oldest are 13 and 14, and they need more privacy when<br/>\nchanging. There are 18 kids in the group, and I think they&#39;re all having<br/>\nfun, and getting what they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to deny that some kids are easier to parent than others, or,<br/>\nto be more specific, some kids are easier for some parents at some times.<br/>\nRain rarely wears pajamas and I&#39;ve never much cared; she also (until<br/>\nmaybe a year ago) wore the same beloved clothes for years, even though<br/>\nthey had holes and stains. For me, and for our life, that wasn&#39;t an<br/>\nissue. OTOH, I get easily overwhelmed by sound, and kids who talk their<br/>\nway through things as they figure them out really wear me out. I can deal<br/>\nwith it when it&#39;s a friend over for the afternoon, but if my kid was like<br/>\nthat it would be a problem for us. Having a baby who cried when she was<br/>\nset down and cried if she wasn&#39;t held the &quot;right&quot; way (upright and facing<br/>\nout) wore me out, but back then I didn&#39;t know there were actually babies<br/>\nyou could put down, and I was so glad she wasn&#39;t like my sister, who had<br/>\ncolic and cried for 4 hours a day no matter what we did. <br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":119296283,"authorName":"myfunny4 &lt;Debbies4@comcast.net&gt;","from":"&quot;myfunny4 &lt;Debbies4@...&gt;&quot; &lt;Debbies4@...&gt;","profile":"myfunny4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: OH!..

It&#39;s hard to explain. <br/>\n&gt; Also, this parent of the special kid faces daily the disapproval of <br/>\n&gt; other parents. Surely the tantrums and behavior are her fault, the <br/>\n&gt; product of her bad mothering skills.

That isn&#39;t unknown of or blaming the parent when dealing with <br/>\nthese kinds of symptoms.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile you make a good case, in general, for being sensitive to a <br/>\nparent&#39;s pain, is this really what is the best focus? Looking at it from <br/>\nthe parent&#39;s point of view, sure. But from the child&#39;s? I don&#39;t think a <br/>\nlabel or a focus on what is &quot;wrong&quot; would have helped me to be a better <br/>\nparent, or more kind, or more generous and understanding of the very <br/>\ndifferent way my youngest responds to the world. If I would have focused <br/>\non my needs, rather than hers, I know in my heart that her developing <br/>\ntrust in me and the world would have suffered and in the long run that <br/>\ntrust would have to be reestablished before she would have been able get <br/>\nbeyond the very behaviors that were causing the problems. Getting to the <br/>\nheart of problems helps in solutions, while finding ways to avoid <br/>\nlooking at them doesn&#39;t, and prolongs the suffering of everyone involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of us were socialized as children to please others and when we <br/>\n&quot;face the disapproval of other parents&quot; we might have the strength or <br/>\nthe will to stand firm in supporting our children&#39;s &#39;differences&#39; or <br/>\nmaybe we won&#39;t. Especially when the behaviors seem to reflect badly on <br/>\nour methods of parenting. Maybe we try to change our child rather than <br/>\nhonor or respect their needs in the face of disapproval.  Maybe it <br/>\nbackfires and the symptoms of &#39;dis&#39; ease get worse and we feel guilty <br/>\nand angry and sad that we tried to be a pleaser rather than stand up for <br/>\nour kid&#39;s rights and it *still* didn&#39;t work and we have an even *less* <br/>\npleasing child. I know I&#39;ve backed down at times in supporting my child <br/>\nand hated myself afterward for wanting to please or accommodate others <br/>\nin the face of disapproval rather than stand up for my child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we can get bogged down in diagnoses and labels of behaviors and <br/>\nthat can get in the way of the actions we need to take, today, to make <br/>\nthe changes our children need from us. Maybe some people have a harder <br/>\ntime than others of letting of the dreams they had or the fantasy they <br/>\nimagined life would be with their children when it turns out <br/>\ndifferently. Should we support them in keeping that fantasy alive or <br/>\nshould we help them gain insights that could change their current <br/>\nunhappy reality?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: OH!..

All I know is that, over and <br/>\nover, my ideas have been dismissed by &quot;special needs&quot; parents who look <br/>\nat my older kids and say I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about since I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have a special needs kid.

And this list is all about unschooling, but <br/>\nmaybe people don&#39;t fully understand special-needs kids here. So <br/>\nthere&#39;s no real perfect place to get advice about it, but this list <br/>\nis definitely better than most mainstream special needs lists.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think <br/>\nthat the recent thread on special needs kids has really helped me out <br/>\na lot. There are obviously moms here who deal with this double-issue <br/>\nof unschooling and a child whose brain doesn&#39;t exactly work in the <br/>\nsame way as most. And making unschooling work can be more challenging <br/>\nwith a child who is so out-of-sync that sometimes there is no way <br/>\nthat makes sense. Helping them find their path is harder when the <br/>\npath is more hidden. With my &quot;normal&quot; kid (god, I hate using that <br/>\nword, but for clarity), all is so straightforward. I can easily see <br/>\nthat if I had two or more kids just like her, I would feel like I had <br/>\nall the answers. It&#39;s my special kid who teaches me that I don&#39;t, and <br/>\nchallenges me to find the path of respect, even when it&#39;s much, much, <br/>\nmuch more difficult. <br/>\nMy post about the haircutting incident is an example. *I* don&#39;t model <br/>\nhaving a problem with haircut. No one else in our family models this. <br/>\nIt&#39;s my son&#39;s internal brain wiring that triggers fight-or-flight <br/>\nresponses that would be more appropriate if, say, we were threatening <br/>\nto burn him with hot irons or something. That&#39;s the level of response <br/>\nhis body accelerates to quickly when faced with a seemingly &quot;normal&quot; <br/>\nstimulus. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo the poster with the boys who throw tantrums, I would suggest <br/>\nreading &quot;The Out-Of-Sync child&quot;, which has been mentioned here a <br/>\ncouple of times. While that might not be any part of the issue, it <br/>\nmight. To a typical eye, it might look like my son is throwing a <br/>\ntantrum in response to something like getting his hair cut. But in <br/>\nreality, it&#39;s a bodily physical response to a perceived threat. It&#39;s <br/>\njust that his brain perceives things as threats that most people <br/>\ndon&#39;t - being touched or hugged, hair brushing, teeth brushing, <br/>\nunusual surfaces or clothing. So that might be part of the issue. <br/>\nMaybe the frustrations of living in a body that always feels &quot;out of <br/>\nsync&quot; boil over. My son used to get frustrated over things that most <br/>\npeople would consider easy - dressing, walking, sitting in a chair. <br/>\nHelping him, through exercises we do at home, and through outside <br/>\noccupational therapy, through therapeutic horseback riding and many <br/>\nother things, his brain is largely re-wired so that these things no <br/>\nlonger cause daily frustrations. The book &quot;The Out-Of-Sync child&quot; was <br/>\na real eye-opening life-saver for us in understanding our son.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also say to other people that in responding to a post from <br/>\nsomeone with a special-needs kid, take a step back first and see if <br/>\nwhat you&#39;re saying is really going to be helpful to that mom. <br/>\nRemember, a parent of a kid like this faces untold stress on a daily <br/>\nbasis, things that parents of &quot;normal&quot; kids cannot even guess at.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if when you woke up in the morning, your child had trouble with <br/>\nwaking up (light is too bright, causing a &quot;tantrummy&quot; physical <br/>\nreaction), then with eating (all foods are too crunchy, too soggy, <br/>\ntoo crumbly, too whatever), then with getting dressed (changing to a <br/>\nnew texture of clothes is too irritating), then with going to the <br/>\nbathroom, then with... well the list goes on.

I will definitely stop <br/>\nthrowing temper tantrums around here.. Gosh, I&#39;ve broken 5 sewing machines, 3 <br/>\nmicrowaves,  and 3 mixers in just the past 6 months.. I also wrecked my car <br/>\nand punched out my window.   I attacked my husband and tried to choke him, <br/>\nthen I kicked him in the groin last night.  I yelled at my kids and called <br/>\nthem no-good fuckers and said they were worthless and they ruined my life. .  <br/>\nJust a few days ago the bread I was making didnt turn out right so I trashed <br/>\nthe whole god damned oven.  Do  you think, when I couldnt get my on loan lap <br/>\ntop from school   to come on and I smashed it to the floor and stomped on it, <br/>\ncould that have been a bad example?  You know, I never realized how my <br/>\nbehavior could affect my kids .  What an insight.. So, do you think, if I <br/>\nstop behaving like this, my sons will stop too??   Maybe its worth a try.   <br/>\nYou know, I really thought you didnt like me, how paranoid of me..  I really <br/>\nneed to work on not being so schizo and afraid that folks are against me.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it works in Doddville, it MUST work here too..
