The second and third floor (first and<br/>\nsecond to the Brit reader) consist of one room each.  Yesterday as I<br/>\nwas walking from the first floor (ground floor to the Brit reader)to<br/>\nthe top floor I stepped on a pile of Yu-gi-oh cards in the entrance to<br/>\nSimon&#39;s room.  Linnaea had piled them up to look through them while<br/>\nshe and Simon were watching the Empire Strikes Back.  I made a note<br/>\nand, slightly irritated, said that they would get destroyed if they<br/>\nweren&#39;t picked up.  I noticed them again later, packed them away in<br/>\nthe bag Simon keeps them in and it was done.  No fights, no spats<br/>\nabout who needed to clean them up, 3 minutes work at most and only<br/>\nthat one moment of irritation from me (actually David mentioned it at<br/>\none point and I said I&#39;d get them in a minute--so maybe 2 minutes<br/>\nirritation in total).  When I went to cuddle Simon to sleep I noticed<br/>\nthat there were a bunch of beads scattered about the floor and I<br/>\nthought I&#39;ll clean those in the morning.  Morning came and as I was<br/>\nfixing some noodles and parmesan for Simon for lunch he came down and<br/>\nsaid he&#39;d cleaned up the beads that were on the floor while he was<br/>\nwaiting for me to come watch the Empire Strikes Back with him.  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t ask him.  I didn&#39;t ask Linnaea.  I didn&#39;t even mention it. <br/>\nHe&#39;s 8.  He&#39;s never been given chores.  Independently he saw something<br/>\nand did it.  It wasn&#39;t his responsibility to take care of it.  Just as<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t my responsibility to make sure the Yu-Gi-Oh cards didn&#39;t get<br/>\ntrashed.  But, I didn&#39;t want him to be unhappy because they did get<br/>\ntrashed, and that was and is more important than me teaching him a<br/>\nlesson about taking care of his things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From the intro to the list&#39;s guidelines, where we ask people to read<br/>\nfor a  <br/>\n&gt; couple of weeks first:<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; -=-Questioning of deeply-held ideas and beliefs can be very<br/>\nuncomfortable  <br/>\n&gt; and sometimes responses to that process can stand in the way of<br/>\npeople getting  <br/>\n&gt; what they need out of the list. -=-<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; The following was sent by someone who joined the list just a few<br/>\ndays ago,  <br/>\n&gt; and so the post was rejected, because I think the feedback might&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen really <br/>\n&gt;  uncomfortable if addressed to the author.    <br/>\n&gt; *****<br/>\n&gt; Yes,I have some thoughts.

I&#39;m bringing the  ideas here, <br/>\nthough, hoping not to cause discomfort (except the healthy kind of  discomfort <br/>\nthat comes from looking at our changing ideas).<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t think this necessarily qualifies as a deeply held idea or  belief.  <br/>\nIt sounds (from some of the phrasing) like recitation of  truisms.  I&#39;ve heard <br/>\nsome of these very same phrases in my life, over the  years, from critical <br/>\nolder female relatives and from strangers and in  discussions such as these.   <br/>\n <br/>\n*****<br/>\nYes,I have some thoughts.  The difference between the childless  <br/>\nfriends, and people with children who don&#39;t want to help clean the  <br/>\nhouse, especially of their own messes, is that (1) the children benefit  <br/>\nfrom having a more or less tidy & clean house,and therefore need to do  <br/>\ntheir little part and (2) they need to see that Mama is not a built-in  <br/>\nservant/slave who comes with the house. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, &quot;force&quot; is  such a dirty word.

One more  thing:  doing it yourself can often be easier than <br/>\ntrying to get all  household members to do their share, no doubt about <br/>\nit. But we do our  children no favor by taking on their <br/>\nresponsibilities.    <br/>\n****<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Responsibility&quot; means that someone is answerable (response is the root  <br/>\nword) to another for the completion of  that task.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnother couple of ideas about it.  There are wheelchair-bound people  who are <br/>\nvery capable of washing dishes in their own houses.  There are  millions of <br/>\nable-bodied children who are NOT capable yet.  Wheelchairs  don&#39;t make the <br/>\ndifference.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-doing it yourself can often be easier than <br/>\ntrying to get all  household members to do their share-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Shares&quot; as in equal shares?  Assigned shares?  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s a hard idea, to only write and post what we&#39;ve really, personally  <br/>\nexamined and understood at a directly personal level, rather than just repeating  <br/>\nwhat we were assured was the way things should be.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe writing above would be considered true and good by countless  people.  <br/>\nThe results are clear around us too.  A lot of frustration  and resentment are <br/>\navoidable.  When I was assigning chores, no one was  happier and the house <br/>\nwasn&#39;t cleaner.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106590,"nextTopicId":106609}}
