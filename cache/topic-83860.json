Wow...memory flood...I must have gotten the abandon part <br/>\nmixed up with Hansel and Gretel.  I really liked that book!

His first wife and 4 of his children died of Typhoid Fever.  <br/>\nHe was left with 2 children.  He then met and married my great grandmother <br/>\n(15 years his junior!  Their marriage certificate says &quot;Indian Territory, <br/>\nOklahoma) and had my Grandma and 3 more kids.  They settled in Albuquerque (where my <br/>\nmom was eventually born.) :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nI sort of like he way kids then were not so sheltered about death.  Sad that <br/>\nthe reason was that so many more children died, but I think being a part of <br/>\nthe wake, preparing the dead for burial, and burying them helped people get <br/>\nthrough the grieving.  We just went to a very old fashioned &quot;home&quot; funeral for one <br/>\nof my husband&#39;s best friends.  They buried him on/in the &quot;back 10&quot; acres.  It <br/>\nwas really, really nice, almost like a picnic (tons of food)...and just felt <br/>\nso homey and comfortable (I guess as comforting as a funeral can be.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B in WV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83792,"nextTopicId":83837}}
