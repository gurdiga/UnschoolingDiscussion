I wanted to add a comment to the bit about <br/>\nchildren with health problems being blessings on their families.  <br/>\nThe nail-bomber who killed several people in a bomb attack on a <br/>\npub in Soho in London was found guilty and sentenced last week of <br/>\nmurder.  On of our current affairs programs ran a long segment on <br/>\nfar-right-wing websites where this individual found the instructions <br/>\nand encouragement to do what he did.  One of the people <br/>\ninterviewed worked for an anti-fascism organisation, but had himself <br/>\nbeen part of the neo-nazi movement.  What changed his mind was <br/>\nthat he had a son born with cleft lip and palate, and would therefore <br/>\nbe euthanised by his peers in the event of their coming to power.  <br/>\nWhat a wake-up call!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10421,"nextTopicId":10425}}
