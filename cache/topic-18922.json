I mean, I hear <br/>\nabout kids fresh out of high school go to be farmers.  Boy wouldn&#39;t I <br/>\nlove to be able to afford to be a farmer.  We looked into it, but <br/>\nit&#39;s soooo expensive!  I mean buying the land.  (still, my husband&#39;s <br/>\nfirst problem with buying a farm - even before the money is...  <br/>\nahem ... &quot;What about socialization??&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion #2:  I just did something stupid, and think I washed all the <br/>\nnutrients out of the soil I&#39;m planning to use as a garden (very small <br/>\nas we don&#39;t have much yard).  I&#39;d like to be able to plant some <br/>\nlettuce, but can&#39;t do compost (neighbors are too close) and no <br/>\nanimals nearby (except dogs and cats) for cheap/free fertilizer.  Any <br/>\nideas for something quick?<br/>\n<br/>\nMelanie in Indiana - it&#39;s still snowing</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18900,"nextTopicId":19019}}
