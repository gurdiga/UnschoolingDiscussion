Till we knew it really worked. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t worried about when she would stop or the laundry the whole <br/>\nthing only became an issue when she realized she could get around wet <br/>\na.m.s but she refused to & she wanted to be upset about it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe always slept through the night so it was never that her sleep was <br/>\ninterupted and in the a.m. she could get out of her wet things and <br/>\ninto one of my T shirts to bum around the house or head straight to <br/>\nthe tub on her own. And for months I continued to do her bed (which <br/>\nhas a plastic mattress so just strip it, wipe it clean, let it dry <br/>\nand re make it).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy X said the same thing his mother shamed him over the issue when he <br/>\nwas a child which I think is so sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for sharing<br/>\n<br/>\nTosca<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\nIf she&#39;s wetting the bed, she shouldn&#39;t be out of diapers at night.<br/>\n...

If there are no<br/>\n&quot;Restrictions&quot; set up entirely for parents&#39; reasons, then there is not<br/>\nconcept of &quot;straying&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Not that I am taking offence but are you in fact from your <br/>\n&#39;enlightened&#39; space suggesting or insisting that those who are not at <br/>\nthe place you see yourself or whom may never be are some how not <br/>\nright? Failing or fooling themselves and or their children. As if <br/>\nthere is really only one right way to rear, learn, grow, teach, be <br/>\ntaught.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers try not to think in terms of teaching or being taught generally.<br/>\nThere are as many ways of learning as there are children, but the general<br/>\nprinciple that learning is continual, automatic and unstoppable applies all<br/>\nover. If interest comes first, learning is joyful - as compared to learning<br/>\nhow to do the minimum to pass, or learning how to keep out of trouble, or<br/>\nlearning that rules are more important to some Moms than happiness. (I&#39;m NOT<br/>\ndirecting this latter idea *personal* way - just noting that it can happen.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I do feel as a homeschooling parent that I and other homeschooling <br/>\nfamilies I encounter are more connected to and therefore enlightened <br/>\nabout our own individual children and in that way a bit more about all <br/>\nchildren. With such new perspectives it does seem like if we could <br/>\nimpart then some of our wisdom to &quot;ordinary parents&quot; and have it take <br/>\nhold it could transform in a positive way many of the things we look <br/>\nout and don&#39;t like to see in our world. But not that this is a simple <br/>\nprocess or an over night evolution. And not that more truth or  wisdom <br/>\nto parents about themselves or their children would lead them to <br/>\nexactly where we have come to or where we are going.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you Unschooling? I ask because you are calling yourself a &quot;home&quot;-<br/>\nschooler. On this list the words are not interchangeable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just trying to better understand Jayn&#39;s needs and desires and fulfill<br/>\nthem on a daily basis, without the baggage from my own traditionally<br/>\nparented childhood and school education, intruding. I don&#39;t know that we<br/>\nspeak for all children, although many of us on this list are passionately<br/>\ninterested in child development theories, if only to compare the general<br/>\nexperience with ours. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe collective wisdom on these lists is to help people get to Unschooling<br/>\nbetter, because those of us who are living it have such joyous lives with<br/>\nour children - even when there are challenges. However unless a parent is<br/>\nactively seeking this wisdom, any notion of how their children&#39;s lives could<br/>\nbe improved tends to elude them, and they continue to argue, including for<br/>\nrestrictions to varying degrees.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first challenge to parents when they start learning about Unschooling is<br/>\nto change their thinking. One important facet of that is to change our<br/>\ninternal dialogue and language use. <br/>\n            <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; When consequences are seamlessly obvious, they need not be <br/>\nmentioned.<br/>\nI cannot blindly agree with this statement. I like it in theory but it <br/>\nhas yet to totally pan out in my life. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope no-one agrees to any statements &quot;blindly&quot;, no matter who makes them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way to state this idea is: Children will learn all they need to from<br/>\ntheir mistakes, without parents needing *make sure* they learn something, or<br/>\neven point out that the mistake happened. Children don&#39;t need an accident<br/>\n(like something fell and broke) pointed out to them, if the broken pieces<br/>\nare on the floor in front of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike if there has been a spill, I give Jayn a chance to pick the stuff up.<br/>\nOften she asks me to do it. I don&#39;t say anything along the lines of, &quot;You<br/>\nspilled that because you were doing such-and-such...&quot;. The only time I would<br/>\nsay this type of line would be if Jayn asked me what happened, and it would<br/>\nbe information not teaching. That has not occurred yet, to my recollection. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying very hard to stop making any comment at all, including a cheery,<br/>\n&quot;Oops&quot; although sometimes Jayn seems to want reassurance - such as that she<br/>\ncan get another. We laugh a lot at spills and topples. Better than grumping<br/>\nabout them. I&#39;d be grumping all day long some days, otherwise. I choose not<br/>\nto.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Example: From her father my daughter inherited bed wetting which has <br/>\nlasted from the time she was out of diapers until this summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was not around when she was 4 so I didn&#39;t know it was from him at <br/>\nthe time but subsequently he has told me he wet the bed till about <br/>\nthis age. Meanwhile I did everything it seemed there was to be tried <br/>\nto curtail bed wetting without trying to make our life crazy or <br/>\nresorting to drugs. After I had tried different things to no avail we <br/>\naccepted it and life went on.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t have thought your daughter&#39;s bed wetting was in the same area of<br/>\ndiscussion as a mistake made, especially since it seems out of her control<br/>\nto alter how fast her body grows.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never made any kind of big deal about Jayn (now 4.5) sometimes wetting the<br/>\nbed - and it is a family bed - in the time between being fully out of<br/>\ndiapers, and her little bladder being grown big enough to last all night -<br/>\nas has occurred until close to her 4th birthday. I&#39;m pretty convinced that<br/>\nbedwetting at 4 is pretty average, to judge by stories from other parents in<br/>\nmy local group and here. Acting like it is a big unusual &quot;inherited&quot;<br/>\nphenomenon may give it more power in your mind and hers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully hearing that you eventually accepted it will help other parents do<br/>\nso at once, without needing to put themselves and their kids through the<br/>\nattempts at curtailing it that made you feel your life was crazy. Just jump<br/>\nstraight to the relaxed part. Many others have already made practical<br/>\nsuggestions to help with this.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I figure, a parent can either fight <br/>\nit and be resentful, or they can clean up and offer opportunities <br/>\nwithout comment. I&#39;ve found the second approach far easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTosca wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Hello Robyn,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I am always nearby on her play-dates.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thankfully I too have not &#39;had&#39; to leave Lenelle with daycare or other <br/>\n&gt;types of people and thus far the biggest clashes we have run into on <br/>\n&gt;the subject of food* have been with Grandma and Grampa (my parents) <br/>\n&gt;who are actually trying to understand and support which makes things <br/>\n&gt;easier. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I would not be leaving her with someone .....unwilling to let her <br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;eat her food, or leave it either (and I <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;would always  have the food bag to leave with her)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can remeber that a packed lunch or picnic (just like the toy bags I <br/>\n&gt;would bring to entertain her during DR. visits and other type <br/>\n&gt;activities I&#39;d think  she might get bored in) couldn&#39;t hold a candle <br/>\n&gt;to what others had.                <br/>\n&gt;Usually I will bring/send a snack all the children can share as a <br/>\n&gt;contribution to the other household wether <br/>\n&gt;they eat it during the time shared or consume other things and have <br/>\n&gt;whatever we&#39;ve given them some other time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;It sounds like your daughter is &quot;testing those boundaries&quot; to use <br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;some jargon from modern parenting. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;LOL well dipping back into &#39;modern parenting jargon&#39; I would counter <br/>\n&gt;&quot;you suggest that like it&#39;s a bad thing&quot; also understanding that who <br/>\n&gt;would say that would I think also be saying &quot;Kids test boundaries to <br/>\n&gt;show us they need us to enforce rules to show we care, and are <br/>\n&gt;concerned about them&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what my daughter is doing, any more than I <br/>\n&gt;believe that&#39;s why all kids, who are doing it, do it.
