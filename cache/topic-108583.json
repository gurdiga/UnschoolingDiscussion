They no longer make everyone spell everything the <br/>\nsame in schools.  This was in a large part due to the fact that so <br/>\nmany non-german speaking people weren&#39;t able to pass the tests and <br/>\nsuch to graduate, largely due to things like spelling.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nI have serious doubts about this. German is VERY phonetic! I can&#39;t imagine Germany passing---or even *considering*---something like this. Conjugating the verbs and declining the nouns ---well, THAT&#39;s another issue! &lt;G&gt; But I don&#39;t think spelling would ever become a problem in Germany. <br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":235458706,"authorName":"Rebecca Benson","from":"Rebecca Benson &lt;rjpbenson@...&gt;","profile":"rjpbenson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] clinging to schoolishness","postDate":"1129214332","msgId":108865,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMDEzMTQzODUyLjU2MDU4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjM1MjExLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGU1LjFkOWM4MWY5LjMwN2Q2MjAwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":108847,"nextInTopic":109007,"prevInTime":108863,"nextInTime":108866,"topicId":108583,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is exactly how I feel...I just hadn t put it into those words for myself.

Not everyone has that kind of support system and even with that support system in place there might be times when you aren&#39;t available and a memo absolutely HAS to go out right then.  That&#39;s when spelling well would come in handy.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that there aren&#39;t ways to get around not being able to spell well.

To me that&#39;s like saying &quot;knowing basic math isn&#39;t important.&quot;  Some things ARE important.  It doesn&#39;t mean that we have to shove things down our kids&#39; throats or hand out worksheets for them to complete, but pretending they don&#39;t matter doesn&#39;t make it so, IMO. <br/>\n <br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n<br/>\nPamela Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 3, 2005, at 7:57 AM, Rebecca Benson wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -=-Spelling isn&#39;t very important these days-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think this is true.

My only child is 11, but I&#39;m already counting on my fingers and <br/>\nrealizing that he&#39;s not going to be a child in my house forever and so <br/>\nI&#39;m trying to squeeze more enjoyment into the years we have left.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, vocabulary lessons seem especially unnecessary.  Having a <br/>\nsparkling adult vocabulary is where my son excells (probably because he <br/>\nhas two doting adults to talk to frequently), even though there&#39;s very <br/>\nlittle in my house that looks like a textbook or a lesson.  It&#39;s pretty <br/>\nhard to get through the day without hearing a lot of words, unless you <br/>\nhold your hands over your ears and sing &quot;la la la -- not listening&quot; &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Even &quot;spelling&quot; has entered our lives, to facilitate playing World of <br/>\nWarcraft.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":235458706,"authorName":"Rebecca Benson","from":"Rebecca Benson &lt;rjpbenson@...&gt;","profile":"rjpbenson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] clinging to schoolishness","postDate":"1127999821","msgId":108603,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwOTI5MTMxNzAxLjQwMjYwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjM1MjA5Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFlYy40NDJkMDZkNC4zMDZiZWNjNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":108583,"nextInTopic":108606,"prevInTime":108602,"nextInTime":108604,"topicId":108583,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You know, I just deleted the message I was about to send because as I read it I realized that for the most part all I was doing was defending myself...and I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1356527322\">You know, I just deleted the message I was about to send because as I read it I realized that for the most part all I was doing was defending myself...and I don&#39;t want to defend old belief systems and actions that I&#39;m trying to get rid of.  I pulled out the deschooling article you wrote and this is it, I&#39;m just going to take the plunge.

No more lessons!&quot;   But I&#39;m just going to quietly let them drop away.
