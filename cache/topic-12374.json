Kids <br/>\nneed the time to veg, be creative and innovative, develop initiative.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also reminds me that unschooling is more than just letting children learn <br/>\nat their own pace.  Children must also be allowed to learn what they need <br/>\nwhen they need it.  It is conceivable that some children may never actually <br/>\nlearn math beyond how to operate a calculator.  If they don&#39;t need math, why <br/>\nbother with it?   When they need it they will take steps to learn it.  If <br/>\nthey need me to help them, I&#39;m right there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat has taken a lot of pressure off me and I worry a lot less.  This is not <br/>\nto say that I don&#39;t present them with opportunities or make suggestions.  I <br/>\ncertainly do.  Sometimes they act on it, sometimes not.  Whichever way is <br/>\nokay.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust passing along some thoughts that have helped me over the hump a few <br/>\ntimes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCarron</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12370,"nextTopicId":12377}}
