far from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe main reason people do not try to nurture innocence within themselves<br/>\nis that the whole enterprise seems unrealistic.   for innocence means a<br/>\ncondition unscared by pain and suffering and everyone has suffered -<br/>\nthat is simply a reality.   therefore to ignore your own suffering, to<br/>\npretend that it very existed, or to paper it over with &#39;positivity&#39;, are<br/>\nlittle more than escape mechanisms.   banished from this world of harsh<br/>\nrealities, innocence has been relegated to the realm of fantasy - peter<br/>\npan&#39;s never-never land, where children can remain children forever.<br/>\nbut in doing that we have also banished the wonder of children - the<br/>\never present freshness of life and a fearless curiosity about the<br/>\nunknown.   these are realities too, but of a different kind than pain.<br/>\nso by depriving existence of wonder and freshness, we&#39;ve been looking at<br/>\nlife extremely unrealistically.   people do not really know what<br/>\ninnocence is.   they simply accept certain beliefs about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n...innocence has a practical value.   it&#39;s not just nicer to be<br/>\ninnocent, if you can regain the level of your intelligence that knows<br/>\nhow to handle life automatically, without the burden of false belief<br/>\nsystems, you have achieved innocence.   a new way of seeing will open<br/>\nup.  at present our way of seeing is fixated on problems.<br/>\n...<br/>\nwhat happens on the other hand if fear and denial are taken away - then<br/>\na new truths dawn.   solving problems should be a joy, a welcome<br/>\nchallenge to our creativity.   this truth is just as valid as the<br/>\nassumption that all problems are headaches.   cleaning up a river does<br/>\nnot have to be a headache.   the headache comes from not wanting to<br/>\nsolve the problem.   preferring to see it as hopelessly complex rather<br/>\nthan as a welcome challenge.   ... only creativity can see past problems<br/>\nto find solutions and this holds true for every area of life.  the most<br/>\noverwhelming disaster is an opportunity if viewed from a different<br/>\nangle.<br/>\n...<br/>\nfor whomever we understand we love.   ...because we feel what the other<br/>\nperson is experiencing, we naturally want to help.   to relieve his<br/>\ndiscomfort is to relieve our own, to give him a gift is to give our self<br/>\na gift... love is the only solution to problems.  it takes love to<br/>\ndissolve separation, to bring people together, to join all life into one<br/>\nharmonious whole.<br/>\n<br/>\n... love is a way of being, not something you give.  ... it expresses<br/>\nitself as rock solid comfort and self acceptance.   children are born<br/>\nhaving this love.    unless we take it out of them, it is part of their<br/>\ninnocence.   mothers also contain this same unshakable love, unless they<br/>\nhave lost it along the way growing up.<br/>\n<br/>\n... the possibility of living without that boundary had to precede it&#39;s<br/>\nphysical removal.  anytime a boundary crumbles an act of healing has<br/>\ntaken place and innocence has been partially restored.  .innocence is<br/>\nthe normal state of life because it is the one closest to our being.<br/>\n... success in live is not determined by what you do but who you are.<br/>\n<br/>\ninnocence radiates love without boundaries.   and this is not the same<br/>\nas indiscriminately gushing to everyone you meet.   ... instead of<br/>\nfeeling weak and isolated your sense of being &#39;i am&#39; will be strong<br/>\nenough to build the world on because you will share the same &#39;i am&#39; that<br/>\nlife itself feels.   on that basis you won&#39;t need to change things one<br/>\nway or the other.   everything will deserve its place under the sun.<br/>\nsuch a state of innocence cannot be imposed.   there is nothing you can<br/>\ndo to get closer to it and yet as you grow in being, innocence flowers<br/>\non its own.   the love that accepts everything is one day found in your<br/>\nown heart.<br/>\n<br/>\ntranscribed from the audio cassettes: the higher self by deepak chopra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5541,"nextTopicId":5526}}
