Now that she has learned to read she often<br/>\nremarks about how smart she is.  Now the paradox - I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t teach her to read other than giving her some<br/>\nvery basic phonics skills.  She taught herself by<br/>\nasking what words were or asking me to show her a word<br/>\nthat I had just read to her and practicing all on her<br/>\nown unbeknowst to me.  Maybe that is my answer - to<br/>\nwrite with her.  Some people on this list have<br/>\nsuggested having her dictate while I do the actual<br/>\nwriting.  Does that lead to independent writing the<br/>\nway reading to a child leads to an interest in reading<br/>\nindependently?

She makes little books.  <br/>\nSomeone else writes what she dictates and then she copies and illustrates it, <br/>\nand reads it back (over and over and over).<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty (12) designs games.

He didn&#39;t know the <br/>\nterm, but he wants me to edit it into a neutral voice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKirby (14) writes in character in RPG games, real-time fast, in chatrooms and <br/>\ninstant messages.  He&#39;s doing a pretty good pseudo-medieval formal  voice.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen a couple of reports he&#39;s written--short, actually-necessary things. <br/>\n One summary to work about what they had in stock for Pokemon league and what <br/>\nwas needed, and another report on the status of the players in his area of <br/>\nresponsibility in the RPG.  They were real writing, for a real purpose, and a <br/>\nspecific recipient.  There are adults who &quot;got A&#39;s&quot; in writing who have never <br/>\nwritten one thing that wasn&#39;t just practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool might not count any or much of that, but I taught composition and I <br/>\ntaught &quot;language arts,&quot; and I&#39;m not one bit worried.  I talk to these kids <br/>\nall the time, and they have language, ideas, and organizational skills.

We<br/>\nunschool in the sense of trusting that our children<br/>\nwill know when they are ready to take on tasks and<br/>\nfollowing their lead for what they want to learn and<br/>\nhow they want to learn it.  My daughter is nine this<br/>\nmonth and took off on reading about 6 months ago.  She<br/>\nspends a fair amount of time reading both fiction and<br/>\nnon-fiction, but also still loves to spend time with<br/>\nher various critters and engage in make-believe play<br/>\nwith her sibling and other children.  She loves to<br/>\ndraw, but she HATESs to write.  If she wants to leave<br/>\nherself a note, for example, to bring her tortoise in<br/>\nfor the night instead of writing out the words she<br/>\nwill draw a picture of the tortoise grazing and post<br/>\nthat where it reminds her.  I have been fine with this<br/>\napproach and have trusted that when she is at a point<br/>\nin her life where she wants to truly express her<br/>\nfeelings she will feel compelled to write.  I have<br/>\nkind of expected this will happen in adolescence. <br/>\nRecently an event happened that is causing me to<br/>\nquestion my judgement.  Has anyone else out there left<br/>\nit up to divine providence that their children will<br/>\nindeed want to, and then proceed to, learn to write<br/>\nwhen they are ready?   Has anyone any regrets about<br/>\nnot being more proactive with their child in teaching<br/>\nwriting?  Thanks in advance for any input.<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
