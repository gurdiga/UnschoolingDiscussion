A parent has to <br/>\nlet go of the obvious markers and be willing to wait years for results to <br/>\nemerge--kind of like the threads on reading or chores.  A child may not <br/>\nread at 6, 9, 12, whenever, but we can hope that by not forcing them to <br/>\nhate reading that they may discover a love of literature when they&#39;re 30. <br/>\nThen again, they may not. Same thing with a &quot;work ethic&quot;: may not happen at <br/>\n10, 15 or even 20, but we can hope that when our children grow into <br/>\nthemselves and have families or responsibilities of their own that the <br/>\nmodeling we have done will serve them well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was not referring to this as a TCS board, but was merely making a <br/>\nconnection between two different, but overlapping philosophies as I spoke <br/>\nabout my own situation. You certainly don&#39;t have to do one to do the other, <br/>\nbut they are very compatible. They have in common an inherent respect for a <br/>\nchild&#39;s autonomy and the trust that a child will discover her/ his own path <br/>\nwhen given the freedom to do so. They both require a parent to let go of <br/>\ntraditional models of parenting that are inherently authoritarian and to <br/>\nleave behind traditional markers of growth and well-being as defined by <br/>\nschools, churches, doctors, whatever form of authority it may be. Not an <br/>\neasy thing to do on its own, never mind once you add the expectations of <br/>\nextended family members, well-meaning neighbors or congregationalists, <br/>\noverly-intrusive school reviewers for those of us who have to deal with <br/>\nthem, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone is interested in reading more about TCS, you may find the <br/>\nfollowing website useful: www.takingchildrenseriously.com  Like <br/>\nunschooling, it can take a bit of getting used to, a bit of mulling over <br/>\nbefore it begins to make sense. Yet another similarity: people are often <br/>\nskeptical and unconvinced (if not downright threatened) by both unschooling <br/>\nand TCS when they first hear about it, reacting with disbelief that either <br/>\ncould ever &quot;really&quot; work.<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":125789604,"authorName":"Onesnotenough@aol.com","from":"Onesnotenough@...","profile":"justlikemama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion]Sandra--- Hello, New and confused.......","postDate":"1069009960","msgId":84898,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3ZC4yMzM5MjZkNy4yY2U5MjYyOEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":84903,"prevInTime":84897,"nextInTime":84899,"topicId":84898,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was not looking for a TCS list, that was a response comment from someone else on the list.
