By and large, he avoids Red Cross materials in favor <br/>\nof the American Heart Association and Nation Safety Council&#39;s course <br/>\nmaterials. He is familiar with and has used the American Red Cross <br/>\nmaterials for CPR, First Aid and Emergency Preparedness. He feels the <br/>\nmaterials are valid and sound educationally, but the whole <br/>\nbureaucracy and $$$ issue comes up again. The ARC is extremely rigid <br/>\nin how courses are to be conducted, making it hard to flex the class <br/>\nto meet the needs and constraints of various industries. <br/>\nAdditionally, each class conducted by a training center must remit a <br/>\nper student payment to ARC. This is not something done by the AHA or <br/>\nNSC. And its not like they need to pay for research as 95% of their <br/>\nfactual info comes from research conducted by the AHA. Red Cross <br/>\nbooks are also more expensive. The reach for $$$ is evident.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor myself, I found it infuriating that scouting is very invested in <br/>\nthe Red Cross and refused, at first, to accept my AHA certifications <br/>\nin first aid and CPR even though the Red Cross courses are based on <br/>\nAHA standards. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am glad to hear from someone who knows the percentage of money<br/>\n&gt; that goes to actual people in need....I have similar reasons for<br/>\n&gt; being anti-United Way.....actually I have MORE reasons for being<br/>\n&gt; anti-Untioed Way :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m with you on this one!

The Red Cross is king of paperwork and &quot;assessment of need&quot;<br/>\n&gt; (read: prove you need this) rather than real and direct help in times<br/>\n&gt; of need. When there&#39;s been a fire or a tornado or other disaster, we<br/>\n&gt; typically refer people to the Salvation Army. If the city cop or<br/>\n&gt; firefighters says this family needs this, that&#39;s all the SA needs to<br/>\n&gt; provide ON THE SPOT help. Conversely, the Red Cross takes hours,<br/>\n&gt; sometimes days, two to three people asking the same questions, and<br/>\n&gt; enough paperwork to choke a horse. Their overhead is tremendous and<br/>\n&gt; their staff is way too fat to get my money. Additionally, money does<br/>\n&gt; not stay locally and cannot be designated to a specific need. Many<br/>\n&gt; folks across the nation believe that they are giving to help folks in<br/>\n&gt; NY with recent Red Cross fund drives. That is not true. They are<br/>\n&gt; giving to a general fund that funds ALL of the Red Cross. Yes, that<br/>\n&gt; certainly helps NY, but that is not what all those $$ have been<br/>\n&gt; pouring in for. Check out their overhead - the portion of each dollar<br/>\n&gt; that actually goes to those in need. It was an eye opener for me a<br/>\n&gt; few years back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s it in a nutshell. My husband wouldn&#39;t give you a dime for the<br/>\n&gt; whole organization.
