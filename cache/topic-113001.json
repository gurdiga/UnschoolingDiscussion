My husbands thoughts on the matter are as follows.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe surest way of alienating your children in regards to dating is to<br/>\nput strict limits on it.  Creating feelings of shame or to expect you<br/>\nto be disappointed with them can create an unbridgeable gap with<br/>\nregards to sex or sexual activity.  The most important thing is to<br/>\nensure they have a strong sense of self worth.  They wont strike out<br/>\nto find it in others through sex or other social means like drugs and<br/>\nalcohol -or at least will be less likely to for those reasons. <br/>\nParticipating in potentially risky behavior can be a choice and not a<br/>\nreaction, but is less likely in children with a strong self worth. <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have had many friends who totally went wild as teens and young<br/>\nadults.  Some ended up in downward spirals of self destruction others<br/>\nare happily walking their paths through life.  The major differences<br/>\nwere the relationships with one or more of their parents or mentors,<br/>\ntheir friends, and their education on the subject (whether through<br/>\nself education or from others).   <br/>\n<br/>\nI was mostly self educated and read a lot on the subject of sex and<br/>\nsexuality, mostly because the miss information I was getting from<br/>\npeers drove me nuts.  Besides not finding the right guy until I was<br/>\nolder than all but one of my close friends I knew I wasn&#39;t ready to<br/>\ndeal with the consequences yet.  It turned out to be rather fortunate<br/>\nas I am rather easy to get pregnant.  One burst condom,  and sex two<br/>\ndays before I missed a pill and had to wait for a week to get them<br/>\nreplaced are proof. (if not the fact we could only squeeze two &#39;tries&#39;<br/>\nin on the week we chose to &#39;try&#39; for baby number four).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso my &#39;right guy&#39; wasn&#39;t &#39;right&#39; because of our fabulous, close,<br/>\nloving relationship, but the way he viewed sex and women.  He loved<br/>\nwomen, different shapes and sizes blondes, brunets, and red heads.  He<br/>\nrespected them and had a good grasp of female sexuality.  He loved sex<br/>\nin a spiritual way and took great pains to find out how his partners<br/>\nwould respond to him and how not to cross comfort zones.  Long story<br/>\nshort he was good at and serious about sex.  It wasn&#39;t just another<br/>\nnotch in the bed post for him but a challenge and life enriching<br/>\nexperience for him.  We were friends for years after but have since<br/>\nlost touch.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t want &#39;my first&#39; to be the crappy experience most of my<br/>\nfriends had.  Cheap and dirty and quick, usually resulting in a loss<br/>\nof friendship(s) if not self respect.  I wanted it to be something to<br/>\nlook back at fondly when I got older.  It is.  Though I can&#39;t remember<br/>\n&#39;The first time&#39; it&#39;s kind of all mashed together as this really<br/>\nfabulous six or eight months of great sex.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I hadn&#39;t felt free to explore sex as a topic of conversation as<br/>\nwell as all the verying sexual situations I tried out before actually<br/>\nhaving sex I wouldn&#39;t have had the crappy experiences and the not so<br/>\ncrappy experiences that led to my choice.  Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t<br/>\nalways so thoughtful with future relationships sexual or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really is an individual choice I think it&#39;s best to arm our kids<br/>\nwith the knowledge to make the choices -best for them- at the time. <br/>\nIt is also important to make sure as best we can as parents that our<br/>\nkids will feel safe coming to us if they need too.  In grade 8 my<br/>\nthirteen yearold friend went through a drug enduced abortion alone<br/>\nwith her not so nice 24 yearold boyfriend who had provided her with<br/>\nthe drugs.  She was never quite the same afterwards and we few who<br/>\nknew about it agonized about what to do or not do as she had sworn<br/>\neach of us to secrecy as her mother would have pitched her from the<br/>\nhouse.  Her twenty something sister had been tossed out at 17 for<br/>\ngetting pregnant and then lost the pregnancy while living on the street.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe huge problem I think that will be avoided buy most unschoolers are<br/>\nthe incidence of polite sex.  Many of my friends had sex even as<br/>\nadults because of their inability to say no to someone.  They had been<br/>\nwell trained to listen to authority and/or not hurt others feelings<br/>\ngrowing up.  So just let the sex happen and then many times just<br/>\nremoved themselves from the relationship afterwards.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast point some people are less outgoing then others or like to keep<br/>\ntheir private life private.  Sandra&#39;s -at least I remember it as being<br/>\nyou if it wasn&#39;t correct me please- suggestion of keeping handy items<br/>\nlike condoms that your kids know they or their friends can use is a<br/>\nway to provide a small safety net for our children.  I know friends<br/>\nthat didn&#39;t have sex because they didn&#39;t have that safety net and are<br/>\nglad of it as removed from the moment they were able to make a better<br/>\nchoice.  But I know far more that didn&#39;t have it and became pregnant<br/>\nor received a new health complication as a result.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe movie American Pie has some good lessons for parents and kids<br/>\nabout how different people react to and experience sex.  It&#39;s not for<br/>\na younger audience I don&#39;t think but, I have only seen the extended<br/>\nand not theatrical release of the movie.  It&#39;s possible the theater<br/>\nreleases would be more suited to perhaps some ten yearolds maybe.  I<br/>\nwould think my son at 11 is&#39;t ready for it yet but that is our family.<br/>\n I know a grown woman who felt it was too much for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould go on but little number four needs some snuggles.<br/>\nTeresa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":252551372,"authorName":"Su Penn","from":"Su Penn &lt;supenn@...&gt;","profile":"marie101365","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Dating","postDate":"1143420433","msgId":113062,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY5RUM5MkFFLTA0MUItNERBQy05NEU1LUVBMTk1NjRCQzJFMEBkaWVyYXVlci5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ0MjcxQUYwLjYwMjA5MDFAc2lvLm1pZGNvLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwMzI2MTgwNTE1LjU4ODM2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxNDE1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPiA8ODExQTNEQkQtQkQxRS00RjA5LUEwOTYtNkQxRjFBOTFEQUJBQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8NDQyNzFBRjAuNjAyMDkwMUBzaW8ubWlkY28ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":113059,"nextInTopic":113067,"prevInTime":113061,"nextInTime":113063,"topicId":113001,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I have felt responsible for it. <br/>\nBut I really listened to what everyone has said on<br/>\nthis post. (when I read a post, you&#39;ll have different<br/>\nvoices in my head) lol   Also, when I posted this on<br/>\nhere, I asked my brother (VERY close relationship)<br/>\nwhat his thoughts were. And we talked about &#39;our talk&#39;<br/>\non sex, relationships, dating, etc... He was 12, then.<br/>\nAnd he told me I gave him the best advice, and that is<br/>\nthe reason he won&#39;t have sex with just anyone. And<br/>\nbecause I&#39;ve been right ( I warned him about his first<br/>\ng/f, she was manipulative and tried unsuccessfuly to<br/>\nget in his pants, all to get pregnant) He trusts my<br/>\nopinion and advice.<br/>\nSo, I am taking his advice so to speak, I am letting<br/>\ngo of my fears. My child (one day children) will be<br/>\njust fine when it comes to dating, sex, relationships.<br/>\nIf I can say one thing on behave of something I shared<br/>\nwith my brother, I showed him (again at age 12) what<br/>\nSTDs looked like. And he said that alone made him want<br/>\nto keep his penis in his pants. Also, I think his<br/>\ngirlfriend helped too. After all she did everything to<br/>\npressure him, and he wouldn&#39;t budge. I&#39;m proud that he<br/>\nmakes decisions based on what I showed him. Because<br/>\nsome people in life can be very scary. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes to the little girl who wants a daddy.<br/>\nShe might crave that for the rest of her life and one<br/>\nday, she might just let it go. As her aunt maybe you<br/>\ncan show her that even without her biological dad, she<br/>\nis still loved and valued. Because that&#39;s really what<br/>\nshe&#39;s looking for. I&#39;ve been down this road. I never<br/>\ngot that until  I was married. That&#39;s one reason it<br/>\nwas so easy for me to be prey. That&#39;s why I never<br/>\nturned in those jerks for all the abuse they put me<br/>\nthrew. I&#39;m all for protecting our kids. But I have<br/>\nseen (which is why, I think I posted, because my heart<br/>\nwas telling me strict rules would only be WRONG) what<br/>\ncan happen if we are strict. As a teenager, I knew a<br/>\ngirl who got pregnant, and the only time she ever had<br/>\nsex, or time to be alone to have sex, was while at<br/>\nchurch. They did it in the baptismal. Lovely, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I said a lot, thanks for hearing me out. <br/>\ndanie<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

I agree with most everything you said and<br/>\nSandra&#39;s comments are great too. Thank you. I don&#39;t<br/>\nagree that &#39;many people do have sex outside of<br/>\nmarriage with no short or long term harm&#39;. Firstly,<br/>\nthere is just no way of really knowing/measuring this.<br/>\nI think that the younger people are, the trickier it<br/>\ncan be to have emotionally healthy sex. I agree that<br/>\nwith lots of trust and dialog between parents and<br/>\nteens, the risks of (emotional) harm are way lower. I<br/>\nrealize also that most all of what people see as<br/>\nexamples of how these things play out are of &#39;schooled<br/>\nand ruled&#39; teens. <br/>\nThe other point I want to add is about single parents.<br/>\nI think it is selfish to have a child as a single<br/>\nparent and not do everything in ones power to provide<br/>\na 2 parent home for a child. Adoption is a solution<br/>\nhere.  What does this say to the fathers of our<br/>\nchildren to not mention the value of a father? We<br/>\ncould go on and on about the value of a father for a<br/>\nchild, for the wife too to have that love and support<br/>\netc. My sister made a concious decision to have her<br/>\ndaughter without a husband. The childs father left and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want any part of it. Much earlier in her<br/>\ndaughter&#39;s life than my sister expected (age 4, I&#39;m<br/>\nguessing) her little girl started expressing the<br/>\ndesire for a father. Of course she was starting to<br/>\nnotice she was different in this way from many kids<br/>\nshe knew. This has been an ongoing emotional issue<br/>\never since. Its always bubbling under the surface. Her<br/>\ndaughter is 10 now. It was heartbreaking then and<br/>\nstill is. And the ups and downs of dating possible<br/>\nfuture fathers, getting attached then having to let<br/>\ngo.......for a child this is.......I don&#39;t know what<br/>\nword to use. Its just so sad to me. And it is<br/>\navoidable. Not to say we (who have a 2 parent home for<br/>\nour kids) have no emotional stress etc. but it just<br/>\nseems like such a more stable base from which to<br/>\nstart. These are (some of) the discussions I&#39;m working<br/>\non with my kids, 14 and 10, how to create and start<br/>\nout with the most healthy and stable marriage, that<br/>\nyou can then bring a baby into. I really think, like<br/>\nSandra spoke to, that if our home life is really<br/>\nenjoyable, it will take a really great person to draw<br/>\nthem away......that they will be more likely to choose<br/>\na great partner. And of course, all the other aspects<br/>\nmentioned, lots of dialog, trust etc.<br/>\nThanks for the dicsussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think a young child could comprehend the idea<br/>\nof abstinence, so <br/>\nI <br/>\ndon&#39;t see how you could teach it from a young age. <br/>\nYou can, however, <br/>\nbe <br/>\nopen and honest with your children from the time they<br/>\nbegan asking <br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can share *your* ideas about the value of<br/>\nabstinence all you want, <br/>\nbut <br/>\nin the end, your child will be the one to make<br/>\ndecisions regarding sex.  <br/>\nIf <br/>\nyour child thinks your biggest concern is abstinence,<br/>\nthey may not be <br/>\nlikely <br/>\nto come to you for help or advice if they make a<br/>\ndifferent choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is very important to differentiate between<br/>\nyour values and <br/>\nfacts <br/>\nregarding sex.  Many people DO have sex outside of<br/>\nmarriage with no <br/>\nshort or <br/>\nlong term harm.  Yes there are risks, but it is not<br/>\ntrue that all sex <br/>\noutside of marriage is harmful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe teen years span from 13 to 19 and the needs and<br/>\ndesires will vary <br/>\ngreatly throughout those years.  There is nothing<br/>\nwrong with <br/>\nencouraging <br/>\nyour teen to do things in groups, rather than one on<br/>\none (and I think <br/>\nmost <br/>\nteens prefer this when they are younger), but at some<br/>\npoint your child <br/>\nwill <br/>\nbe alone with someone of the opposite sex.<br/>\n<br/>\nA neighbor once asked me if I have had &quot;the talk&quot; with<br/>\nmy kids.  My <br/>\nreply <br/>\nincluded that there isn&#39;t &quot;the&quot; talk - there are lots<br/>\nof small moments <br/>\nwhen <br/>\nwe can share facts and our thoughts/beliefs/values/<br/>\nwith our children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had an experience about a week ago.  A friend<br/>\nstopped by my house.  <br/>\nShe is <br/>\ngetting divorced and had planned to unschool her<br/>\nchildren, but now they <br/>\nare <br/>\nin school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter she left, I drove Lisa (13) to an activity in<br/>\ntown.  It seemed <br/>\nlike a <br/>\ngood opportunity to talk about one very real risk of<br/>\npregnancy out of <br/>\nwedlock or with the wrong person - that you will end<br/>\nup as a single <br/>\nparent. <br/>\n(Plus we were side by side in the car &lt;g&gt;)  I said<br/>\nthat it is not a bad <br/>\nthing to be a single parent, but that it is very<br/>\ndifficult.  Not only        <br/>\nis <br/>\nmoney likely to be in short supply (something my dd is<br/>\nfamiliar with), <br/>\nbut <br/>\nthe one parent may not be able to figure out a way to<br/>\nstay home with <br/>\nthe<br/>\nchild/ren.  I mentioned the problem of what to do when<br/>\nthe child is <br/>\nsick - <br/>\nthat the parent may not have sick leave and staying<br/>\nhome could mean <br/>\nless $$ <br/>\nin the family budget.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was a personal example that she could understand.<br/>\n I did not say <br/>\nthat <br/>\nshe *should not* have sex before marriage, I simply<br/>\ntold her about a <br/>\nreal <br/>\nlife situation for someone she knows.

Pregnancy? Disease? Or are you <br/>\ntalking about morals? It will help you to sort this out if you get <br/>\nclear on what you&#39;re actually concerned about. For the first three, <br/>\nthere are lots of alternatives to a big dating prohibition that will <br/>\nhelp you keep your kids safe *and* calm your fears. If you think <br/>\nunschooling will somehow contribute to your child having &quot;loose&quot; <br/>\nmorals, well, we have other things to talk about than dating. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do in fact have fears of sex itself, then I would hope that you <br/>\ndon&#39;t intend to pass them on to your children! Whatever caused your <br/>\nfears is not part of *their* lives. Give them the chance to have <br/>\nhealthy, joyous sex lives by sharing with them that healthy, joyous <br/>\nsex lives are possible and desirable.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughters are 12 and 13. For their whole lives, they have seen <br/>\ntheir dad and me hugging, kissing, snuggling. As they&#39;ve gotten older, <br/>\nwithout any real plan to do so, it has become natural and comfortable <br/>\nfor dh and me to engage in some rated-G sexual playfulness in front of <br/>\nthem. We (meaning the kids and the parents) also have casual talks <br/>\nabout whatever sex-related subjects that come up during life. We don&#39;t <br/>\napproach sex as a big, scary subject; it&#39;s just another unschooling <br/>\ntopic of conversation, you know?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result is that the kids take things in stride. They often respond <br/>\nto our playfulness with their own playful eye-rolling and &quot;Oh, <br/>\nbrother&quot; type comments. And one day, when one of them walked in on dh <br/>\nand me at a private moment, she simply turned around again and walked <br/>\nout, mostly unphased. Dh later asked her if her eyes were all right. :-<br/>\n)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year, both girls are headed off to situations where they will <br/>\nhave virtually their first chance to be alone with boys. We have <br/>\ntalked about some good-sense safety precautions, and I related a story <br/>\nfrom my college days about a vulnerable situation I got myself into <br/>\nthat I look back and know I was lucky to get out of safely. I&#39;ve also <br/>\ntalked frankly about how good sex feels, and how easy it is to get <br/>\ncarried away when it&#39;s all new to you. We didn&#39;t need to go into much <br/>\ndetail about STDs and pregnancy because, well, those topics are kind <br/>\nof old news by now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the point is, sex and its pleasures and dangers and <br/>\nconsequences are all out on the table. When my daughters become <br/>\ninterested in dating, there won&#39;t be rules about it. No curfews, no <br/>\ngroup requirements (not sure how this would help, given the number of <br/>\ncars that contain multiple necking couples), no chaperones. Instead, <br/>\nthere will be talks about comfort levels and safety, self-respect, <br/>\nlove, birth control, and courtesy, and there will be, I hope, a mother-<br/>\ndaughter relationship that allows for questions and sharing and the <br/>\noccasional tidbit of advice.<br/>\n<br/>\ndf</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Dating","postDate":"1143236869","msgId":113012,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjYwMWM2NGY4YyQ5YTZlMTg0MCQ2NTAxYThjMEBob21lPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwMzI0MjAzNjA3LjkwNzMyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyOTEzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":113009,"nextInTopic":113013,"prevInTime":113011,"nextInTime":113013,"topicId":113001,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==-=-=-=-=-=-=I feel teenagers shouldn t date one on one, or be alone because of my fears about sex.

And then I wouldn&#39;t have to worry about my <br/>\n&#39;rules&#39; about dating. =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think a young child could comprehend the idea of abstinence, so I <br/>\ndon&#39;t see how you could teach it from a young age.  You can, however, be <br/>\nopen and honest with your children from the time they began asking <br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can share *your* ideas about the value of abstinence all you want, but <br/>\nin the end, your child will be the one to make decisions regarding sex.  If <br/>\nyour child thinks your biggest concern is abstinence, they may not be likely <br/>\nto come to you for help or advice if they make a different choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is very important to differentiate between your values and facts <br/>\nregarding sex.  Many people DO have sex outside of marriage with no short or <br/>\nlong term harm.  Yes there are risks, but it is not true that all sex <br/>\noutside of marriage is harmful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe teen years span from 13 to 19 and the needs and desires will vary <br/>\ngreatly throughout those years.  There is nothing wrong with encouraging <br/>\nyour teen to do things in groups, rather than one on one (and I think most <br/>\nteens prefer this when they are younger), but at some point your child will <br/>\nbe alone with someone of the opposite sex.<br/>\n<br/>\nA neighbor once asked me if I have had &quot;the talk&quot; with my kids.  My reply <br/>\nincluded that there isn&#39;t &quot;the&quot; talk - there are lots of small moments when <br/>\nwe can share facts and our thoughts/beliefs/values/ with our children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had an experience about a week ago.  A friend stopped by my house.  She is <br/>\ngetting divorced and had planned to unschool her children, but now they are <br/>\nin school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter she left, I drove Lisa (13) to an activity in town.  It seemed like a <br/>\ngood opportunity to talk about one very real risk of pregnancy out of <br/>\nwedlock or with the wrong person - that you will end up as a single parent. <br/>\n(Plus we were side by side in the car &lt;g&gt;)  I said that it is not a bad <br/>\nthing to be a single parent, but that it is very difficult.  Not only is <br/>\nmoney likely to be in short supply (something my dd is familiar with), but <br/>\nthe one parent may not be able to figure out a way to stay home with the<br/>\nchild/ren.  I mentioned the problem of what to do when the child is sick - <br/>\nthat the parent may not have sick leave and staying home could mean less $$ <br/>\nin the family budget.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was a personal example that she could understand.  I did not say that <br/>\nshe *should not* have sex before marriage, I simply told her about a real <br/>\nlife situation for someone she knows.  It gives her one more thing to <br/>\nconsider when she is making choices in her life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":174410770,"authorName":"D Smith","from":"D Smith &lt;sandshuse@...&gt;","profile":"sandshuse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Dating","postDate":"1143232567","msgId":113009,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwMzI0MjAzNjA3LjkwNzMyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyOTEzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEExOTg4QkIyLTI4MTItNEY1RS04QjZELTg0NjEwNUQzMkJBOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":113007,"nextInTopic":113012,"prevInTime":113008,"nextInTime":113010,"topicId":113001,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Forgive me, I am still new, when it comes to unschooling.

We&#39;re in a new house and I can hear them  easier at night now when <br/>\nI&#39;ve gone to bed.  They stay up later than I do  watching TV or playing games or <br/>\njust hanging out together. Many nights I wake up  not because the TV is too <br/>\nloud but because of the sound of their laughter. It&#39;s  a comforting happy sound <br/>\nand a nice way to go to sleep.<br/>\n <br/>\nLogan planned his 13th birthday party last week and the first person on his  <br/>\nguest list was Brenna.  I didn&#39;t expect them to be such good friends when  <br/>\nthey were teens.  It&#39;s very cool.<br/>\n <br/>\nGail<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nGail<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Kids getting along","postDate":"1143213645","msgId":113001,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERBRDgyREM1LUNDOUEtNEI2Ny1CRENELTRGNTA0QUQ4QUNGN0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":113002,"prevInTime":113000,"nextInTime":113002,"topicId":113001,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is this the list where we were discussion kids getting along?

If  <br/>\nnot, I&#39;m starting a new topic. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember how school drove a big wedge between me and my sister.  I  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t even allowed to communicate with her at school.  She was in  <br/>\nfirst grade when I was in fourth.  Our recesses and lunches were at  <br/>\ndifferent times.  But the teachers and the other kids kept people  <br/>\nfrom mixing with kids much younger or older than they were.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom contributed too, by shaming me and &quot;making me&quot; take her places  <br/>\nwith me or share with her, so that I never wanted to choose to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur relationship was not good and is still strained because of some  <br/>\nof those things.  She&#39;s still very frustrated and self conscious if I  <br/>\ndo something more easily than she does, or have something better, and  <br/>\nshe tends to laugh and do the happy dance if she bests me.  If my  <br/>\nkids do better than hers at something, she goes into a funk or pout.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was looking at MySpace.  Holly does some cool html stuff.  And I&#39;m  <br/>\nnot at all surprised Holly has her brothers on her &quot;top eight&quot;  <br/>\nfriends section.   I thought it worth pointing out for the record  <br/>\nthough, that Kirby, at 19, with 58 friends (other sites that are  <br/>\nreciprocal with his), has Marty 3rd and Holly 4th.   The first is  <br/>\nanother unschooler he&#39;s known since they were 7 and 8.  Second is a  <br/>\nhomeschooler he knew from the SCA, who is in the military now.  Of  <br/>\nthe remaining four, one&#39;s a homeschooler and three he knows from a  <br/>\ngaming shop.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty, 17, has 63 friends and he has Holly in first position and  <br/>\nKirby in 2nd.  Then  there are three locals he met through  <br/>\nhomeschooling or La Leche League (lifelong friend, Julie), then one  <br/>\nhe met at a Live and Learn conference, and the next two I&#39;m not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly was the least sibling friendly.  Marty is #5 and Kirby is #6.    <br/>\nStill, top eight. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re friendly other ways too, of course.  Marty is playing  <br/>\nOblivion in Kirby&#39;s room.  Holly and Kirby play Guitar Hero in  <br/>\nMarty&#39;s room (and Kirby&#39;s working on Final Fantasy X-2 sometimes, in  <br/>\nMarty&#39;s room).  Kirby has gone to housesit, and took the laptop that  <br/>\nbelongs to the family but is &quot;Holly&#39;s computer,&quot; and she&#39;s using his  <br/>\nwhile he&#39;s gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s very little &quot;no&quot; or &quot;get out&quot; and I think it&#39;s because they  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t hear that much from me or their dad.  They&#39;re generous because  <br/>\nthat&#39;s what they&#39;re used to.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":113077,"nextTopicId":113111}}
