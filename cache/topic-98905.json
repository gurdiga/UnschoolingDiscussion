I wish I had never been pushed to &quot;interact&quot; as a child.  It bred a lot of confusion for me and created a deep anxiety that to this very day I fight and struggle with.  I just had my own way of approaching opportunities, and wish that I had been allowed to do so as a child.  Instead, I was always &quot;wrong&quot; in whatever I did.  Today, I know that I was just different and it&#39;s okay.  Let him develop as he needs.  He just may need a little extra time with those things that are familiar and comforting.  As others have suggested, offer him opportunities but let him decide when/if he is ready.  He walked when he was ready, right?   This will be the same thing.  Trust your gut - he&#39;s YOUR child.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as participating in activites with him, talk to the teachers of classes.  Surprisingly, many will allow an adult to participate with their child.  Some don&#39;t, but I guess that&#39;s their perogative and you may choose not to go to that class.  However, make sure your child wants to participate in the class, not that he&#39;s doing it to please you on some level.  It won&#39;t be his activity or fun otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nWin 1 of 4,000 free domain names from Yahoo!
