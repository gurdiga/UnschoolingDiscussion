The dance<br/>\nteacher, whose goal is &quot;fostering children&#39;s creativity and love of movement<br/>\nin a non-judgmental environment&quot; was completely understanding of this<br/>\nbreaking of her usual procedure. Over the first year I moved from being in<br/>\nthe room, to on the stairs, then in the second year down to the living room<br/>\nbelow (another rule broken), and now finally Jayn runs off into the house<br/>\nwith no concerns at all and I chat with the other parents outside.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;i have tried getting a kids yoga video, but it was loud and had too <br/>\nmany bright colors and the &#39;actors&#39; seemed embarassed to be doing <br/>\nyoga, and tried to pretend it was really all about hip hop and <br/>\njumping around. can any of you recommend good yoga or other exercise-<br/>\ntype videos?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn and I have a couple of Yoga Zone videos, very much gentle moving and<br/>\ntwisting, and our absolute favorite is Rodney Yee and his associates - &quot;Yoga<br/>\nfor Beginners&quot; - &quot;AM/Stress Relief/PM&quot; very serene and gentle. The DVD<br/>\nversion includes all three sessions, and a section on how to use the tools<br/>\nwhich is very helpful. Jayn will usually encourage us to do a good hour of<br/>\nit. If it is jumping about it is a different kind of Yoga - some of the<br/>\ntraditions are very active and athletic.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn dances to the music in her ordinary dvd&#39;s, especially the credits of<br/>\nsome of them. It is the music that is important to her, rather than the<br/>\nviduals.

Frankly,<br/>\nI don&#39;t think the structure of gymnastics really applies until the kids can<br/>\npay attention to the techniques, and that&#39;s maybe 6 or 7... but that&#39;s just<br/>\nmy casual observation of the classes we used to attend with my own dd.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was 3 she happened to see a class, and wanted to join.  It was<br/>\ndesigned for young toddlers, and wasn&#39;t even called gymnastics - it was<br/>\ncalled tumbling.  The teacher put out all of the same equipment at<br/>\ndifferent stations, and each Mom casually and naturally manned the station<br/>\nto help out.  There were no lines, no hassles with the kids, no techniques<br/>\nrequired.  The kids were able to move about however they wanted, from<br/>\nstation to station - or over and over in the same place.  This is probably<br/>\nwhat people are calling &#39;open gym&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe teacher that offered this class ran her classes pretty much like this<br/>\nuntil the kids got more serious themselves (and also until they had been in<br/>\nschool and were used to the &quot;routine&quot;.)  But, but the class wasn&#39;t designed<br/>\nfor serious competition gymnastics.  She wanted it to be fun for the kids.<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t offer the youngster class at the moment because she has 2 young<br/>\nkids of her own now and can&#39;t afford the time away... otherwise my dd would<br/>\nstill be there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to encourage you to not care what the teacher thinks.  It&#39;s<br/>\nmuch more important what your dd thinks, you want to support her not the<br/>\nteacher.  We&#39;re so ingrained to &quot;respect&quot; teachers as the authorities, but<br/>\nunfortunately they can often stifle the natural interest and learning<br/>\ntalents of our kids.  If a teacher doesn&#39;t want your child in their class,<br/>\nthink of it as a blessing and know that the truth is probably that you<br/>\ndon&#39;t want the teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMahalo,<br/>\nBarbara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nps.

There are different gyms with different attitudes and <br/>\ndifferent types of classes. We first went to a local cheap class when <br/>\nds was 2 and the teachers were idiots. Then we went to Gymboree--far <br/>\naway and expensive--and the teachers actually knew how to interact <br/>\nwith different types of kids and it was great (and they don&#39;t force <br/>\nkids to join in the activities). If you have one anywhere near you, <br/>\ncheck it out! You don&#39;t have to join at the beginning of one of their <br/>\nsessions--if they have room in a class, you can join half way through <br/>\nand pay a pro-rated amount. They also have open gym-type classes <br/>\nweekly. And you get to try a class for free. Can you tell I miss it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe local MOMS Club arranged something recently at a local gym where <br/>\nthere were things for babies/toddlers to do with moms and at the same <br/>\ntime, the older kids could go off to the other end of the gym for a <br/>\nclass. It was wonderful for me, because usually there&#39;s a class for <br/>\none kid while the other kid is supposed to be waiting! Anyway, my <br/>\npoint was going to be that if there&#39;s not currently an opportunity <br/>\nfor 3 year olds to have an open gym weekly, talk to people, see if <br/>\nyou can round up a demand for it and then ask the gym if they have <br/>\ntime for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nno teachers want her in <br/>\n&gt; their class! i tried showing her some of the stretches and such at <br/>\n&gt; home, but she just does not want to do it the way i show her, and i <br/>\n&gt; can see how this would frustrate a teacher! i feel like crying. i <br/>\n&gt; KNOW she could be so good at this, and really enjoy it, and finally <br/>\n&gt; make friends, but no teacher would want her if she keeps acting <br/>\nlike <br/>\n&gt; this. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like this is really important to you for this to happen, <br/>\nbut she&#39;s pretty clearly saying this is not what she wants right now. <br/>\nShe has many years to learn gymnastics. She doesn&#39;t need to feel like <br/>\na failure at age three! Her activities should be easy for her and <br/>\nfun, not forced. When she&#39;s ready, it will be clear. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we went to this MOMS Club class recently, I was really not sure <br/>\nif ds would go off with the teacher or if he&#39;d prefer to stay with <br/>\nme. Okay, I assumed he&#39;d stay with me, honestly, based on other <br/>\nexperiences! I was filling out paperwork when the teacher came over <br/>\nlooking for any more 4 year olds. He went off with her and never <br/>\nglanced back once in 45 minutes. The room was huge and most of the <br/>\ntime I could barely see him.

In our town there are community  centers you <br/>\ncan walk right into on any given day, get out the tumbling mats and  tumble <br/>\ntil your heart&#39;s content.

You want friends because you like them  and they&#39;re <br/>\nfun and they like you.  Find a playgroup in your area, or an  unschooling group. <br/>\n Don&#39;t make a deadline to have friends by her birthday  party.  Just make <br/>\nfriends, with no goal in mind. <br/>\n <br/>\nShe is ONLY 3.  That is soooo young.

Then try group classes when she understands more <br/>\nabout  class rules.
