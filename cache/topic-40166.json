I found this.....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Birth of Isreal<br/>\n&gt; The state of Israel was proclaimed by the Jewish leader, David Ben Gurion, <br/>\n&gt; on May 14, 1948, and officially came into being on the 15th, after British <br/>\n&gt; Mandatory rule ended at midnight. In many minds, the birth of Israel is <br/>\n&gt; closely identified with the Nazi terror in Europe and the Holocaust, but in <br/>\n&gt; fact the conception of and planning for a Jewish state had begun some 60 <br/>\n&gt; years earlier. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; The Messianic idea of returning the Jews to their &quot;promised land&quot; had been a <br/>\n&gt; Puritan religious belief since the 16th Century. In the mid-19th Century, <br/>\n&gt; British politicians saw another value: that of having in place in the <br/>\n&gt; Middle East a Jewish entity sympathetic to the British Empire. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Two phenomena made real these and the Jews&#39; own previously vague <br/>\n&gt; aspirations of &quot;return&quot;: the burgeoning European nationalism of the time, <br/>\n&gt; from which the Jews felt excluded; and the massacres, or pogroms, carried <br/>\n&gt; out by Tsarist Russia against its six million Jews, the largest single <br/>\n&gt; Jewish population in Europe, which spread into the Ukraine and Poland. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; By the 1880s, groups of desperate Russian and other Eastern European Jews <br/>\n&gt; were settling in Palestine, which was under the somewhat tenuous authority <br/>\n&gt; of the Turkish Ottoman Empire.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The visionary Austrian-Jewish journalist, Theodore Herzl, clarified and <br/>\n&gt; gave political weight to the concept of Jewish nationalism - or Zionism - <br/>\n&gt; and a national home for the Jews in Palestine at the first Zionist Congress <br/>\n&gt; at Basle, in Switzerland, in 1897. He won wide Jewish backing for it, and <br/>\n&gt; tried, at first unsuccessfully, to encourage the British Government to <br/>\n&gt; support it. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It was not until World War I, when British forces were at the gates of <br/>\n&gt; Jerusalem, in November, 1917, that the British Foreign Secretary, Arthur <br/>\n&gt; Balfour, anxious for Jewish support in the war, issued his epic yet <br/>\n&gt; ambiguous Declaration. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This said the Government viewed &quot;with favour the establishment in Palestine <br/>\n&gt; of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best <br/>\n&gt; endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly <br/>\n&gt; understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and <br/>\n&gt; religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine...&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Turks defeated, the British ruled Palestine as a military authority <br/>\n&gt; from 1917 until 1922. Then the League of Nations awarded Britain the <br/>\n&gt; Mandate to govern Palestine and prepare its citizens for self-government. <br/>\n&gt; From that moment, Jewish immigration from Europe increased phenomenally, <br/>\n&gt; with the British Cabinet pledged rigorously to honour Balfour&#39;s promise of <br/>\n&gt; a Jewish homeland, as it was interpreted by the Zionists. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Already during the 1930s, the displacement of the Arab population began The <br/>\n&gt; Arabs of Palestine, not even referred to by name in Balfour&#39;s document, <br/>\n&gt; were increasingly angry at what they feared would be their eventual <br/>\n&gt; replacement and domination by an alien, inspired and technologically <br/>\n&gt; superior people of different religion. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bloody inter-communal rioting broke out during the 1920s, the most <br/>\n&gt; notorious example perhaps being the massacres of some 60 religious Jews in <br/>\n&gt; the town of Hebron, about 20 miles south west of Jerusalem. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The situation intensified in the 1930s as Nazism spread across Europe, <br/>\n&gt; bringing more persecution and more and even more sophisticated and <br/>\n&gt; determined Jews to Palestine. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Arabs were incensed. In 1936, they rose in armed revolt, mainly against <br/>\n&gt; the British rulers they saw as authors of their plight. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But they were disorganised, factional and poorly equipped. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; British soldiers searching Arabs during the revolt in the late 1930s By <br/>\n&gt; 1939, the British had crushed the uprising, ending for good effective Arab <br/>\n&gt; resistance to the Mandatory Power and the Zionist planners, and leaving <br/>\n&gt; behind a fractured Palestinian-Arab society. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Arab resentment, however, did force the British, first, to abandon a <br/>\n&gt; plan to partition Palestine into Arab and Jewish sectors; and seriously to <br/>\n&gt; restrict Jewish immigration at that very crucial moment, in 1939-40, when <br/>\n&gt; Hitler was at his most dangerous, conquering Europe and launching his <br/>\n&gt; mission to exterminate the Jewish people. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The British idea was that the Arabs would rule Palestine, inside which <br/>\n&gt; would be established a finite Jewish entity. It was the Zionists&#39; turn to <br/>\n&gt; be outraged and to work, successfully, to explode this stratagem.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In 1948, the Jews in Palestine managed to establish their own state, <br/>\n&gt; Israel. The price to pay were decades of war and violence. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The contrast between the growing Jewish society in Palestine - the Yishuv - <br/>\n&gt; and the indigenous, mainly Muslim Arab population could not have been <br/>\n&gt; greater.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In 1917, two-thirds of the roughly 600,000 Arab population, were rural and <br/>\n&gt; village-based, with local, clannish loyalties and little connection with <br/>\n&gt; the towns. What passed for &quot;national&quot; Arab leadership was based in the <br/>\n&gt; towns, though there was little national identity. Two or three established, <br/>\n&gt; rival families dominated Palestinian politics. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The majority of the Jews arriving in Palestine were well organised, <br/>\n&gt; motivated and skilled. In the early 1920s, they set up an underground army, <br/>\n&gt; the Haganah, or Defence. A Jewish shadow government was set up, with <br/>\n&gt; departments which looked after every aspect of society: education, trades <br/>\n&gt; unions, farmers, the &quot;kibbutzim&quot; settlements that spread across Palestine, <br/>\n&gt; the law, and political parties. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; During World War II, Haganah fighters joined the British Army, acquiring <br/>\n&gt; military skills and experience. Not so the Arabs. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At the same time, extremist groups such as the Irgun Zwei Leumi and the <br/>\n&gt; Lehi, or Stern Group, began a brutal campaign of assassinations, bombings, <br/>\n&gt; kidnappings, intimidations, disruptions and sabotage. Their actions were <br/>\n&gt; directed against Briton, Arab and even Jews. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; During the World War, the Zionist movement clearly defined its objective as <br/>\n&gt; a dominant Jewish state in Palestine. Deep plans were laid.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After 1945, as the facts and consequences of Hitler&#39;s death camps became <br/>\n&gt; evident, the Jewish underground intensified the terror campaign to oust the <br/>\n&gt; British, whom they accused of Arab sympathies. Jewish organisations tried <br/>\n&gt; to restart unlimited immigration. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enormous emotional and political support for the Zionists came from the <br/>\n&gt; United States. The enfeebled postwar British Government no longer had the <br/>\n&gt; strength or the stomach to control Palestine or try to find a middle way <br/>\n&gt; that would suit both Jews and Arabs. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Arabs rioted followed the UN vote <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Britain handed the problem to the United Nations. On November 29, 1947, the <br/>\n&gt; UN General Assembly voted to partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab <br/>\n&gt; sectors. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There was violent and total Arab opposition, but wild Jewish acclaim. <br/>\n&gt; Fighting started almost immediately. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Even before the mandate ended, in April and May, Jewish fighters moved to <br/>\n&gt; protect, consolidate and widen the territory for the new Jewish state. <br/>\n&gt; Often they attacked areas designated for Arabs, and tried to depopulate <br/>\n&gt; Arab areas in the planned Jewish sector. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On April 9, Jewish fighters massacred more than 200 Palestinian villagers, <br/>\n&gt; including old people, women and children, in the West Jerusalem village of <br/>\n&gt; Deir Yassin, causing widespread panic and greatly augmenting the flight of <br/>\n&gt; Palestinians from their homes across the country. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As the Jewish authorities had predicted, Arab armies from Egypt, Jordan, <br/>\n&gt; Syria, Iraq and Lebanon tried to invade Palestine as soon as the British <br/>\n&gt; forces actually left. But the Arab campaign was a generally badly <br/>\n&gt; organised, uncoordinated affair with untrained units who were no match for <br/>\n&gt; the Haganah and, later, the Israeli Defence Force. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Palestinian militias and other Arab irregulars were also easily <br/>\n&gt; crushed. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There was one exception: the British-trained and British-officered Arab <br/>\n&gt; Legion, under the command of King Abdullah of Jordan. But it was <br/>\n&gt; constrained financially and politically by the British-dominated King, who <br/>\n&gt; had already colluded with the Jewish leaders on territorial matters and who <br/>\n&gt; had ambitions in Palestine. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Arab Legion, therefore, was restricted to defending territory in and <br/>\n&gt; around East Jerusalem and the Old City and on the West Bank of the Jordan, <br/>\n&gt; which it did successfully. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; By the middle of 1949 up to 700,000 of about 900,000 Palestinian Arabs had <br/>\n&gt; left the affected region, forced out by a combination of Jewish/Israeli <br/>\n&gt; terror tactics, the frightening thrust of war, the contagious panic of <br/>\n&gt; local residents, fractious and incompetent Arab leadership, the flight of <br/>\n&gt; some richer and therefore influential families and the actual sale of Arab <br/>\n&gt; land to the Jews without coercion, often by absentee Arab landlords. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; These Palestinians had fled from their homes for ever, though they did not <br/>\n&gt; know it at the time. They ended up in the refugee camps of Lebanon, Syria, <br/>\n&gt; Jordan and Egyptian-run Gaza and in the Palestinian territory of the West <br/>\n&gt; Bank, which was ruled by the Jordanian King Abdullah, as was Arab East <br/>\n&gt; Jerusalem. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Those Palestinian refugees and their descendants in the region now number <br/>\n&gt; more than three million. Israel has since refused to allow the refugees to <br/>\n&gt; return as long as Arab states remain pledged to its destruction, often <br/>\n&gt; claiming that there was no room for them anyway. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Peace treaties and agreements with Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian <br/>\n&gt; movement have not altered this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In 1917, there had been 50,000 or so Jews in Palestine. By 1948, they had <br/>\n&gt; become 650,000 Israelis. At the same time, the majority of Palestinian <br/>\n&gt; Arabs had left Israel; only 200,000 or so withstood the war and other <br/>\n&gt; depradations and remained in Israel. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Israel became a state on May 15, 1948, and was recognised by the United <br/>\n&gt; States and the Soviet Union that same day. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Israel&#39;s Arab neighbours , however, united their forces to drive the Jews <br/>\n&gt; out of Palestine. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BY: Tim Llewellyn. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lawsociety.org/Intifada2000/articles/apartheid.htm&quot;\">http://www.lawsociety.org/Intifada2000/articles/apartheid.htm&quot;</a>&gt;Israel - Land of Apartheid&lt;/A&gt; By Professor Tanya Reinhart, September 2000<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40203,"nextTopicId":40185}}
