My daughter will love trying this- <br/>\n<br/>\nShe had a slimy science kit that made something like this( and lots of other neat stuff). It then turned into a trip to the plastics museum in Leominster, MA. I wasn&#39;t very pro - plastics - but the museum was really cool. They had a whole program for homeschoolers with all kinds of stuff to do. They  made a sort of silly putty and a &quot;rubber&quot; ball to take home. She also explained how latex is used to make parachutes and they made their own &quot;strings&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was funny -the lady said they make the school kids leave their concoctions because they tend to get all over the bus - and balls bouncing off the bus drivers heads etc. but since our kids were homeschooled - they could take them home.(minus the parachute thing - I guess it could be toxic -)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - if anyone is near Leominster, MA it was a fun excursion. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Heidi <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, May 09, 2003 10:10 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Gooey Gunk: A Recipe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is FUN! From the book &quot;The Ultimate Book of Kid Concoctions&quot; <br/>\n  which we have out from the library (but may just have to buy)<br/>\n<br/>\n  It makes a slick, shiny, malleable stuff, like Slime(tm) without the <br/>\n  stickiness. I thought we&#39;d have  probs with the color staining <br/>\n  things, but nope. It&#39;s just gloppy and stretchy and gooey. <br/>\n<br/>\n  WHAT YOU WILL NEED:<br/>\n  Solution A<br/>\n  1 c. water<br/>\n  1 c. white glue<br/>\n  2 TBSP. liquid tempera paint or 7-10 drops food coloring<br/>\n<br/>\n  Solution B<br/>\n  1 1/3 c. warm water<br/>\n  4 tsp borax laundry booster<br/>\n<br/>\n  HOW TO CONCOCT IT:<br/>\n  1. Mix ingredients in solution A together in a medium bowl<br/>\n  2. In a second medium bowl, mix the ingredients in solution B <br/>\n  together until the borax is completely dissovled.<br/>\n  3.

Store Gunk in an airtight container or plastic zip bag.<br/>\n<br/>\n  when Robby lifted the stuff out of Solution B(step 5), it dripped <br/>\n  between his fingers in big globules, and was sort of sticky, but as <br/>\n  he kneaded it, it transformed into a sort of quivery, gooshy stuff. <br/>\n  He did black, but we thought a brownish red would be good.
