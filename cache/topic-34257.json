That isn&#39;t UNschooling,<br/>\nit might be eclectic but &quot;sounds&quot; more like school at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mention &quot;teaching learning&quot; as a goal.  UNschoolers have a goal of<br/>\nraising a happy, healthy child who acquires the knowledge they want and need<br/>\nwithout anyone having to &quot;teach&quot; them UNLESS they ask for help and then most<br/>\nof us would &quot;help,&quot; not sit down and &quot;teach.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you &quot;blend, using direction, guidance, maturity and my role as her parent<br/>\nto turn her on to things that she is excited about,&quot; then you are using the<br/>\neclectic/relaxed homeschooling method.  And if that works for you and your<br/>\nfamily is happy with it, then that is great.  However, it isn&#39;t unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt tells me that you haven&#39;t reached the point where you can &quot;let go&quot; and,<br/>\nas son #3 puts it, &quot;go with the flow.&quot;  And it isn&#39;t to say that as<br/>\nunschoolers we don&#39;t provide any stimulous to encourage exploring new or<br/>\ndifferent avenues, it simply means that we don&#39;t decide that we know what is<br/>\nbest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m continually off doing things that are new and different and the kidlets<br/>\nmay follow along or they may not.  We have a house full of &quot;stuff&quot; and they<br/>\nmay or maynot explore those varous avenues.  Their choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think maybe the difference could be that I say, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m going to<br/>\nArtie&#39;s, ya wanna come along,&quot; and eclectic/relaxed homeschoolers would say,<br/>\n&quot;Let&#39;s go to Arties.
