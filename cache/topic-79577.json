Nobody else wants to share the responsibility, and I don&#39;t want <br/>\nto do it, so why not just forget it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s how my son feels, and if you walk in his room right now, you <br/>\nwill see an unmade bed, piles of dirty clothes, dirty dishes, empty <br/>\nglasses, food trash and empty food containers, and ants following a <br/>\nlittle trail to his room because they know that&#39;s where the food <br/>\ncrumbs are.  You will walk by him and his hair stinks because he <br/>\nrefuses to take a shower and wash it.  Eventually this is going to <br/>\nget to be a health hazard, but that&#39;s ok because we don&#39;t have to do <br/>\nanything we don&#39;t WANT to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhere do we draw the line here?<br/>\n<br/>\nJudie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2856611,"authorName":"Judie C.
