The feeling permeates the air---and US!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nI am relatively new to this list -- I joined after attending the Live and Learn conference. I have to say that this conference was really altering to me and my family. We have always felt uncomfortable in our local homeschooling groups, and truthfully didn&#39;t quite understand why. I must say that after a day at the conference we all just started feeling like we had found home. My daughter felt totally comfortable, and commented that everyone she met was different, and it was okay! They were not necessarily different like her, but different like themselves. So after trying to figure out what type of learners we are, we have learned that we are much more in tune with unschoolers. Why has it taken us so long? I am learning so much from this list, and I am questioning so much about myself as a parent. And I agree with needing to be around people who inspire me.

BUT... (ain&#39;t there  <br/>\nalways? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s so easy to see how Frank Smith&#39;s idea plays out. This was an inclusive  <br/>\ngroup---anyone can attend. It seems that most are unschoolers (several  <br/>\nradicals) and relaxed homeschoolers: they seem to be the only  ones who are willing <br/>\nto spend a weekend with their kids! &lt;G&gt; But it was  NOT a solely radical <br/>\nunschoolers group----and you could feel the  difference.<br/>\n <br/>\nI NEED to be around unschoolers. I know that. Just having a few curriculm  <br/>\nusers there made it &quot;acceptable&quot; to use a curriculum! Made it OK to discuss  <br/>\nSaxon Math. Made it OK to yell at kids (not a lot; just a couple). It just  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t the same. <br/>\n <br/>\nI think when your options are homeschoolers OR schoolers, then  homeschoolers <br/>\nare more like-mided. But if you have an option of unschoolers OR  an <br/>\ninclusive homeschool group----it&#39;s just not like-minded at all and.....well,  it&#39;s <br/>\nHARD to be around the c-word. <br/>\n <br/>\nI guess I&#39;m just not very inclusive! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nIn the first hour of the L&L conference, a few of us heard a mom being  very <br/>\nshort-tempered and snapping at her kids. One mom whispered to me, &quot;I  didn&#39;t <br/>\nthink I&#39;d hear *that* an this conference.&quot; I responded that this was the  first <br/>\nhour---that she must be new, and that she won&#39;t be acting like that by  <br/>\nSunday! I was right. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nBeing surrounded by radical unschoolers makes it so much easier to BE a  <br/>\nradical unschooler. The feeling permeates the air---and US!<br/>\n <br/>\nIt was also easier to see how controlling your children is easier when  <br/>\nsurrounded by controlling parents with controlled kids. Moms whose kids are  <br/>\ngetting &quot;out-of-hand&quot; are immediately made to feel that they NEED  to do  something <br/>\nabout it. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe really had a good time, but we recognized *our* need to be around  <br/>\nunschooling families---around like minds.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99889,"nextTopicId":99859}}
