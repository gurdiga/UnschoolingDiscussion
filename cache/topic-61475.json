My name is Elizabeth.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Welcome!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;...wanting to play the guitar (which we intend to<br/>\n&gt; begin if we can ever <br/>\n&gt; &gt;find affordable lessons for her).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Elizabeth<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know you&#39;ve already gotten a lot of great<br/>\n&gt; responses on this, but I do <br/>\n&gt; want to reiterate, being a guitarist and being the<br/>\n&gt; wife of a private guitar <br/>\n&gt; teacher: Don&#39;t wait for being able to afford<br/>\n&gt; lessons.  Your daughter does <br/>\n&gt; not need them, and they can take all the fun out of<br/>\n&gt; playing, especially if <br/>\n&gt; you get the &quot;wrong&quot; teacher.  I&#39;ve seen it happen<br/>\n&gt; loads of times; lessons <br/>\n&gt; can strip all the fun, joy and passion right out of<br/>\n&gt; guitar playing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Teaching oneself to play the guitar can be one of<br/>\n&gt; the great joys in life; <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s REALLY easy to do, and it can give a person the<br/>\n&gt; feeling of success <br/>\n&gt; that&#39;ll make them want to continue with it. <br/>\n&gt; Lessons*can* (not *will,* by <br/>\n&gt; any means) do just the opposite.  Because guitar is<br/>\n&gt; such an incredibly easy <br/>\n&gt; instrument to teach yourself and play as a beginner,<br/>\n&gt; it can be tremendously <br/>\n&gt; fun from early on.  If a person is really driven to<br/>\n&gt; keep improving past the <br/>\n&gt; point of just competency on the instrument, I<br/>\n&gt; believe that would be a good <br/>\n&gt; time to seek out a teacher to take a guitar player<br/>\n&gt; to the next level.  But, <br/>\n&gt; there are a lot of cool musical/math things to be<br/>\n&gt; gained from playing the <br/>\n&gt; guitar, even at a beginner&#39;s level.  And, they can<br/>\n&gt; be gained without a <br/>\n&gt; person ever being aware that they are gaining them. <br/>\n&gt; Of course, one of the <br/>\n&gt; big benefits is the notion that, &quot;If I can teach<br/>\n&gt; myself to play the guitar, <br/>\n&gt; I can probably teach myself anything I really want<br/>\n&gt; or need to know.&quot;  Well, <br/>\n&gt; at least it has worked out that way in my life.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The best way for your daughter to get started on the<br/>\n&gt; guitar is to find out <br/>\n&gt; what songs your daughter likes to listen to/sing<br/>\n&gt; along with the <br/>\n&gt; most.  Then, get the easiest songbook with those<br/>\n&gt; songs in it, and make sure <br/>\n&gt; the book has those little guitar chord diagram boxes<br/>\n&gt; in it.  Then, give her <br/>\n&gt; the book and the guitar and get out of the way,<br/>\n&gt; unless she asks for help <br/>\n&gt; figuring out the little diagrams.  Because she&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; already know the songs, <br/>\n&gt; her ear will help her self-correct. The diagrams are<br/>\n&gt; really <br/>\n&gt; self-explanatory; in fact, that&#39;s exactly how I<br/>\n&gt; taught myself to play at <br/>\n&gt; that age.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The suggestion that was made of having her be with<br/>\n&gt; other kids who are <br/>\n&gt; playing guitar is a great, great suggestion. Just<br/>\n&gt; playing with and watching <br/>\n&gt; other kids play the guitar will show your daughter<br/>\n&gt; lots of things that no <br/>\n&gt; one will even have to explain to her.  That&#39;s how I<br/>\n&gt; learned three-finger <br/>\n&gt; (Travis) picking, a technique I love and use to this<br/>\n&gt; very day!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband is a classical/jazz guitarist and<br/>\n&gt; composer.  He didn&#39;t take any <br/>\n&gt; lessons until he was 22 years old.  He was a great<br/>\n&gt; guitarist at that point, <br/>\n&gt; but he felt that he needed something more formal to<br/>\n&gt; master jazz theory and <br/>\n&gt; application and classical technique.  He still will<br/>\n&gt; take a lesson or two <br/>\n&gt; from time to time, even though he really is a<br/>\n&gt; world-class player.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, my time limit is running out. ;-)  Have fun!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Warm wishes,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Marji <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Your daughter does <br/>\nnot need them, and they can take all the fun out of playing, especially if <br/>\nyou get the &quot;wrong&quot; teacher.  I&#39;ve seen it happen loads of times; lessons <br/>\ncan strip all the fun, joy and passion right out of guitar playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeaching oneself to play the guitar can be one of the great joys in life; <br/>\nit&#39;s REALLY easy to do, and it can give a person the feeling of success <br/>\nthat&#39;ll make them want to continue with it.  Lessons*can* (not *will,* by <br/>\nany means) do just the opposite.  Because guitar is such an incredibly easy <br/>\ninstrument to teach yourself and play as a beginner, it can be tremendously <br/>\nfun from early on.  If a person is really driven to keep improving past the <br/>\npoint of just competency on the instrument, I believe that would be a good <br/>\ntime to seek out a teacher to take a guitar player to the next level.  But, <br/>\nthere are a lot of cool musical/math things to be gained from playing the <br/>\nguitar, even at a beginner&#39;s level.  And, they can be gained without a <br/>\nperson ever being aware that they are gaining them.  Of course, one of the <br/>\nbig benefits is the notion that, &quot;If I can teach myself to play the guitar, <br/>\nI can probably teach myself anything I really want or need to know.&quot;  Well, <br/>\nat least it has worked out that way in my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way for your daughter to get started on the guitar is to find out <br/>\nwhat songs your daughter likes to listen to/sing along with the <br/>\nmost.  Then, get the easiest songbook with those songs in it, and make sure <br/>\nthe book has those little guitar chord diagram boxes in it.  Then, give her <br/>\nthe book and the guitar and get out of the way, unless she asks for help <br/>\nfiguring out the little diagrams.  Because she&#39;ll already know the songs, <br/>\nher ear will help her self-correct. The diagrams are really <br/>\nself-explanatory; in fact, that&#39;s exactly how I taught myself to play at <br/>\nthat age.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe suggestion that was made of having her be with other kids who are <br/>\nplaying guitar is a great, great suggestion. Just playing with and watching <br/>\nother kids play the guitar will show your daughter lots of things that no <br/>\none will even have to explain to her.  That&#39;s how I learned three-finger <br/>\n(Travis) picking, a technique I love and use to this very day!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is a classical/jazz guitarist and composer.  He didn&#39;t take any <br/>\nlessons until he was 22 years old.  He was a great guitarist at that point, <br/>\nbut he felt that he needed something more formal to master jazz theory and <br/>\napplication and classical technique.  He still will take a lesson or two <br/>\nfrom time to time, even though he really is a world-class player.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, my time limit is running out. ;-)  Have fun!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWarm wishes,<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10722572,"authorName":"Nora or Devereaux Cannon","from":"&quot;Nora or Devereaux Cannon&quot; &lt;dcannon@...&gt;","profile":"thatincase","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Hi!

We re using the Sonlight curriculum, and enjoying it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-911397151\">Hello, I&#39;m new to this group! My name is Elizabeth. Right now I&#39;m <br/>\njust HSing my oldest, who just turned 7. We&#39;re using the Sonlight <br/>\ncurriculum, and enjoying it alot, but I&#39;d eventually like to move <br/>\naway from the curriculum being the core of their learning. By the <br/>\ntime she is a teen I&#39;d like her to be in charge of most of her <br/>\neducation although I will encourage specific skills I think that <br/>\npeople need such as home economics and personal financial management. <br/>\nOur other children are 3; 19 months, and a Baby due in August.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion is...right now she is not interested in much of anything. <br/>\nHow can I help her to find interests? About the only things she had <br/>\nany sort of sustained interest in has been butterflies and wanting to <br/>\nplay the guitar (which we intend to begin if we can ever find <br/>\naffordable lessons for her). <br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61458,"nextTopicId":61515}}
