My 10yo has a paper route, and he knows<br/>\nenough people on the route that if he gets too cold,<br/>\nhe has a place to warm up, if older kids throw<br/>\nsnowballs at him, he has places to visit until they go<br/>\naway. He&#39;s made great friends with a 94 yo man. Yes, I<br/>\ncould get paranoid about the 94 yo man, but then I<br/>\nwould be depriving ds of a wonderful friendship. I<br/>\nalso let the kids (ds is 8) go without to the library<br/>\n2 blocks away. Not alone but with each other.
