It is very awful, lots of people and grown-ups too died!&quot; ~ Quentin, 5, Wheat Ridge, Colorado<br/>\n<br/>\nTo her father, a Port Authority Policeman in New York City, as he headed back out to help at &quot;ground zero&quot;: &quot;Daddy, just stay out of buildings with planes in them.&quot; ~ Sara, 6, New Jersey<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the &quot;bad guys&quot;: &quot;Police should put on parachutes and go up to get the planes down and put them in jail.&quot; ~ Brandon, 6, Raleigh, North Carolina<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Mommy, I know something bad happened today. I&#39;m not sure what. But the emperor is OK.&quot; ~ Patrick, 4, St. Louis, Missouri<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Didn�t the bad people know they were going to die too?&quot; ~ Sean, 6, Wyoming<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They meant to do that?!?&quot; ~ Patty, 9, Quebec, Canada<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It must have just been an accident. Nobody would want to really run into a building.&quot; ~ Trudy,5, Quebec, Canada <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Are you sure this is not a movie, Mom?&quot; ~ Devon, 7, New South Wales, Australia<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Can we adopt some of the kids who lost their mommies and daddies in those buildings?&quot; ~ Quentin, 5, New Zealand<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Dad, I am afraid of the hate I am feeling inside. How do I make that stop?&quot; ~ Sanisha, 14, Toronto, Canada<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Didn�t the bad guys care that all those people on the planes were loved by someone?&quot; ~ Hayden, 7, Great Britain<br/>\n<br/>\nIn an email from a college student who should be excited about the new semester to her Mom:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So you know how you tell me when things are bad to look for something positive to look forward to? Well, what is it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Will the people still get to have birthdays in Heaven?&quot; ~ Culley, 9, Oregon<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The only good thing that comes out of this is how our nation really unifies and comes together as a kind of family when a tragedy like this occurs. There is nothing more unifying than a common enemy. I also pray for the terrorists involved and organizing this kind of attack. I wish they could realize the true horror in what they have done.&quot; ~ Nyssa, 16, North Carolina<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When our government goes after the terrorists, how can they keep from killing more innocent people in another country? They can�t, can they, Mom?&quot; ~ Steffi, 10, New Brunswick<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My heart is hurting and I am afraid to go to sleep.&quot; ~ Dwayne, 8, New York City<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the &quot;bad guys&quot;: &quot;He must be a silly man. Which decent person would fly right into the building with so many people on it and inside the building? Was there something wrong with him? Can he not see that he will die too? If he wants to die at least he should let the others get away from danger.&quot; ~ Shoba Laxmi, 6, Singapore<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Will we be safe in our basement, Mommy?&quot; ~ Nicki, 3, Idaho<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Don�t cry Mommy, they are with God, they are happy with God.&quot; ~ John, 7, Texas<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Will I get drafted if we go to war?... I wish time would just stop now.&quot; ~ Kevin, 18, Kansas<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I wish I could hug all those crying people in the United States.&quot; ~ Toki, 11, Japan<br/>\n<br/>\nThese sentiments consistently echo through our children, from the smallest to the tallest. In their innocence, they care, they cry, they want so badly to reach out and comfort the stricken. As we jaded adults confront our feelings of anger, rage, hate and revenge, perhaps we can all learn from the words of one of our youngest, Tanya, 5, of Anchorage, &quot;Love can make this better, Mommy, I just know it. If we just keep the gas tanks in our hearts filled with love, the world can get better.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a child shall lead them...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25940,"nextTopicId":25830}}
