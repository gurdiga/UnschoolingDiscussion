He was very into voices--voice acting, ventriloquism, <br/>\nsinging.  He said &quot;Julie Andrews&quot; and I typed that and all around the others <br/>\nin the chat were posting &quot;Amy Grant&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Amy Grant&quot;<br/>\nand Kirby said<br/>\n&quot;and Michael Jackson&quot;<br/>\nand the rest went <br/>\n&quot;Amy Grant&quot;<br/>\nand<br/>\n&quot;Amy Grant.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby had no idea who Amy Grant was, but he wondered why they all named the <br/>\nsame person.  When I told him it might be the only one their parents were <br/>\nletting them listen to he was so surprised!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here he was thinking it was an honest question about singing ability and <br/>\nexpression, and it was just girlie chit-chat about &quot;who do you think is <br/>\ncool,&quot; and he wasn&#39;t much interested in those chats after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41313,"nextTopicId":41545}}
