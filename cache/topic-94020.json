I am <br/>\nfirmly convinced, based on many years of experience and interest in how <br/>\nchildren learn, that early phonics is a serious risk to a child&#39;s <br/>\nlong-term reading and learning ability. I wouldn&#39;t take the risk. It <br/>\npushes one particular way of learning on a kid that may be in conflict <br/>\nwith that child&#39;s own individual learning style and that can really be <br/>\nharmful to do to a young child. Look at what the schools are turning <br/>\nout with all their early emphasis on phonics/reading. It isn&#39;t <br/>\nnecessary - let your child learn when she&#39;s good and ready to do it her <br/>\nown way. In the meantime, surround her with a print-rich environment <br/>\nand lots and lots of opportunity to play with pencils and paper and <br/>\ncrayons and markers and paint and stickers and stamps and post-it notes <br/>\nand tape and staplers and paper of all kinds and maybe restaurant pads <br/>\nand little tiny pads of paper and big giant sheets of paper and <br/>\nscissors of all kinds and on and on with whatever interests her.  And <br/>\nread aloud all the absolutely wonderful picture books there are out <br/>\nthere - don&#39;t be in a hurry to move past those - and play stories and <br/>\nmusic on cd&#39;s/tapes including storytellers and musicals and include <br/>\nbooks with lots of repetition like Patty Wolcott&#39;s &quot;The Marvelous Mud <br/>\nWashing Machine&quot; and &quot;The Cake Story.&quot; Put your energy into high <br/>\nquality books - every dollar spent on a very very special picture book <br/>\ninstead of some phonics program is a dollar VERY well spent. Please <br/>\ndon&#39;t hurry her.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor math - spend your money, instead, on puzzles and building materials <br/>\nlike lego and Kapla blocks and pattern blocks and geoboards and games, <br/>\nespecially games using dice and cards and strategy games like Othello <br/>\nand Pente and visual games like SET.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m serious - I do like looking at what other homeschoolers are doing <br/>\nas far as curriculum, but it is an interest of mine, I&#39;m curious.

I have been researching <br/>\nhomeschooling and have been very interested in/drawn to/comfortable <br/>\nwith unschooling as a way of life for my family.  I feel I understand <br/>\nthe philospophy, but I still feel a little fear about completely <br/>\nletting go and doing it (or NOT doing what everyone else is doing, <br/>\nexpects, etc.).  I have an open-minded husband, and a few <br/>\nhomeschooling friends (traditional parenting, curriculum-users) but <br/>\nlittle support otherwise.  I joined this list and have been re-<br/>\nvisiting Unschooling.com for some reassurance, as I am somewhat <br/>\nnervous about taking the first &#39;official step&#39; into hs, by not <br/>\nsending dd to kindergarten.  I also have been needing some help with <br/>\ncommunication & mindful parenting (thanks for the referral to <br/>\nNoMoreSpanking -- great people).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Here&#39;s what I am afraid of with the preschool idea. <br/>\n&gt;What I&#39;m worried &gt;about is that Scotty will love it so much (all the <br/>\n&gt;toys, art supplies, playground equipment) that when he gets too old <br/>\n&gt;for it he will still want to go to &quot;school&quot; like all his friends <br/>\n&gt;(and all of their parents are calling preschool &quot;school&quot;, I guess to <br/>\n&gt;get them used to the idea), even though kindergarten is much more <br/>\n&gt;structured. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We sent Orion to preschool when she was 3yo, because it was what <br/>\neveryone recommended and what everyone was doing, as well as to give <br/>\nourselves a break as we adjusted to life with younger dd.  The <br/>\nprogram was quality (if you agree with acadmeics at young ages), the <br/>\nteachers were nice, and Orion loved it, but we chose not to send her <br/>\nback for the second year for the same concerns as above.  As we <br/>\nstrengthened our resolve to pursue hs, we did not want her <br/>\nbrainwashed into what &#39;school&#39; is, and confused when she did not go <br/>\nto that wonderful place when her friends do...  We got a lot of crap <br/>\n(and still are) from family but we really feel we made the right <br/>\ndecision.  I have always seen learning, and my dh is coming to <br/>\nunderstand the concept of learning from life.  For &#39;preschool at <br/>\nhome&#39; we are providing dds many opportunities and fostering their <br/>\ninterests as we see them develop. We tried being more structured, but <br/>\nolder dd is very independant, and we soon saw that she learns best on <br/>\nher own terms.  So, our (dh & I) private catch-phrase after getting <br/>\nquestioned or harrassed as to how preschool at home is going, or when <br/>\nwe see dds doing/saying something impressive is &quot;guess the <br/>\nhomeschooling is going well&quot;! <br/>\n<br/>\nI will admit that while I feel unschooling is the way for our family, <br/>\nI have been exploring different materials (ie for phonics/math), and <br/>\nmethods like Charlotte Mason, mostly out of fear.  We don&#39;t even have <br/>\nto notify in Ohio until age 6 but the kindergarten thing is freaking <br/>\nme out a little...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the inspiration this group provides.<br/>\nMelissa Z.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94116,"nextTopicId":94133}}
