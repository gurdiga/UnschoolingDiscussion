One <br/>\ndinner included garlic bread and the other did not. The researchers then stayed <br/>\nto observe and record the family interactions during the evening.<br/>\n<br/>\n       The Garlic Bread Effect cannot be overstated!<br/>\n<br/>\n       When garlic bread was present, they recorded 8 percent more positive <br/>\nfamily interactions and 22 percent fewer negative interactions. Astonishing! <br/>\nHow have the PTA and the NEA missed this connection?! <br/>\n<br/>\n       (Maybe Paul Vallas -- formerly Chicago superintendent so he OUGHT to <br/>\nknow about the Foundation&#39;s scientific findings, one might argue -- should <br/>\nstart sending out parent report cards grading the home use of garlic bread to <br/>\nsupport the school curriculum.)<br/>\n<br/>\n       I first tumbled to this research in a piece by New York Daily News <br/>\ncolumnist Lenore Skenaz. Then I found the Foundation&#39;s website at <br/>\nwww.smellandtaste.org where I read that the irresistible smells of daily life, like warm <br/>\nchocolate, spicy peppermint and fresh bread baking, can make our brains and <br/>\nmemories work measurably better! Dr. Hirsch apparently has written a book about <br/>\nthis, titled &quot;Life&#39;s a Smelling Success!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n       p.s. the site offers a &quot;snack food personality study&quot; too, if you want <br/>\nto have some fun with your family -- after all the garlic bread is gone <br/>\ntonight. :)  JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89079,"nextTopicId":89057}}
