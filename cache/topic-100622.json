He doesn&#39;t sound like he needs a curriculum to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m hoping that my son finds a great business to run as well, so much better than flipping burgers (no offense to burger flippers, but that&#39;s hard work for little pay).  He&#39;s five and already talking about what businesses he is going to own and what he can sell.  I own two small businesses myself, so that will probably open the door for him sooner.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember as a kid, I wanted to sell sno cones to the kids in my neighborhood.  My mom didn&#39;t want me taking real money from the kids, so she made me set a jar of pennies on the table next to my stand and the kids could take money from there to pay me.  Even then I knew that was so bogus.  I&#39;ve always wanted to own my own business.  I think some have that drive or need, and some don&#39;t.  My business partner is not entrepreneurial at all and struggles with so many things about running our business.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like your creating a great environment in your home.<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100544,"nextTopicId":100620}}
