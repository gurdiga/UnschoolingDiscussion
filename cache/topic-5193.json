Fall and Winter are the seasons we spend almost no time in the house during, and Summer is when we find ourselves cocooning and digging into our books more deeply. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn South Florida, where I live, it&#39;s a particularly perfect unschooling environment, because the museums and malls and parks have always got something going to attract touristsy attention...as though tourists are the only one&#39;s seeking culture and history. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our case, we&#39;re right on the edge of the Everglades National Park, and we&#39;re about 30 minutes from anything and everything else we might want to do or see. <br/>\nAlso, the libraries often put on shows of their own. It&#39;s easy to break up the monotony (often self-inflicted) when we need to. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have lived in Florida for most of my life, and I didn&#39;t fall in love with the place until we began unschooling. I felt too rushed around to notice the subtle season changes, or the incredible range of plant life. Our family needed a shift in perspective to be able to actively appreciate what had been around us all the time. Unschooling has certainly done that.<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nSteph</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5205,"nextTopicId":5180}}
