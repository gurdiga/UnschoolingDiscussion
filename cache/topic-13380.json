First of all, as you can tell, it<br/>\n&gt; starts really early in my house. We begin with subtle things like listening<br/>\n&gt; to carols, watching videos, and reading books. As the season progresses we<br/>\n&gt; do things like put up decorations, do some wrapping of gifts and start<br/>\n&gt; planning meals and visits. By the time Thanksgiving has passed we&#39;re in full<br/>\n&gt; swing. Trees, wreathes. lights, fires, cocoa and carols every night.<br/>\n&gt; Christmas Eve is even more special to me than Christmas Day. It&#39;s usually a<br/>\n&gt; family day spent doing a lot of last minute bustling. Then it&#39;s off to<br/>\n&gt; church for a candle light service that after 22 years in the same church<br/>\n&gt; still brings tears to my eays. The kids sing and at the end everyone has a<br/>\n&gt; lit candle and when those lights go out and Silent Night is sung it knocks<br/>\n&gt; your socks off. Then it&#39;s home to celebrate with friends and try to get<br/>\n&gt; little ones to bed (yeah right ). Christmas morning we open gifts. Then<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re off to my mom&#39;s for more gifts and breakfast. Then it&#39;s off to my in<br/>\n&gt; laws for yet more gifts, dinner, and enough dessert to last all year. Then<br/>\n&gt; we crash!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Amy<br/>\n&gt; Mom to Samantha, Dana, and Casey<br/>\n&gt; The World Is Our Classroom<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13442,"nextTopicId":13455}}
