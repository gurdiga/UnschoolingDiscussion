I ran across him while on  Amazon a <br/>\nweek or so back, when I was looking up the book, &quot;The Way Life Works&quot;  (kinda a <br/>\ncool, illustrated biology &quot;reading&quot; book) and his books popped up as  being <br/>\nbought by other people who bought &quot;The Way Life Works.&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nI ended up actually buying 2 of his books on Ebay...&quot;Why We Run&quot; and  &quot;Winter <br/>\nWorld.&quot;  Both have beautiful illustrations, and my son (who hates  to read) <br/>\nhas been glued to &quot;Why We Run.&quot;  Has anyone read any of his  stuff?<br/>\n <br/>\nAny other suggestions of cool, fun to read biology type books?  I&#39;m a  big <br/>\nfan of &quot;The Cartoon Guides&quot; but the biology one didnt have good  reviews.  I did <br/>\nget &quot;The Cartoon Guide to Genetics&quot; though...haven&#39;t been  able to look at it <br/>\nyet.  <br/>\n <br/>\nNancy B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100703,"nextTopicId":100693}}
