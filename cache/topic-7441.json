Five families send their kids<br/>\nto five homes, a different one each day of the week. It is child led, and<br/>\nparent facilitated for the most part. Some kids stay home some days of the<br/>\nweek. I like the model for parents who want to/have to work. I am wondering<br/>\nwhether I want to create the same thing in my neighborhood. Yet in my work<br/>\nwith having a playgroup, with a couple kids, I realize that I can&#39;t read a<br/>\nbook as long as I could with my child only. I have the concern that<br/>\nteaching/learnoning would be more superficial the more kids there. It does<br/>\nseem freer than regular school, and these kids live in a neighborhood of<br/>\nBoston, so public schools are not so great. The kids vary in age from4-8,<br/>\nand this is the second year they have done hs together. They know how to<br/>\nwrite (little ones)and read(older kids) with very little instruction in that<br/>\narea.<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a quick question--  Has anyone been asked to homeschool other people&#39;s<br/>\nchildren?</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"HPaulson5@aol.com","from":"HPaulson5@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"0W9UBUMzed8brDkzwDm_XSWXc1H3_7VBgEIcW1njPyKNLWWYPKq-jw5-Iyfg3-IXCFC8isMp_60","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Unschooling kids that are not yours","postDate":"954371075","msgId":7441,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5LjMwMTA3ZGQuMjYxM2U2MDNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7450,"prevInTime":7440,"nextInTime":7442,"topicId":7441,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just a quick question--  Has anyone been asked to homeschool other people s children?
