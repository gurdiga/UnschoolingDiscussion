So I composed<br/>\na short story on the spot to sum up the fears that the curfew laws had<br/>\nsummoned in me.  When Kim wrote to say that the story was &quot;true&quot; I believe<br/>\nshe meant in the sense that there were existing curfew laws that she had<br/>\ndiscovered, not that this particular scenario was the personal history of<br/>\nreal children.  I picked the names out of thin air, my kids are named<br/>\nAlexander and Thomas, and are far too young to even go in the yard by<br/>\nthemselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also wasn&#39;t thinking of kids on a big city street.  More along the lines<br/>\nof a town the size of ours, with kids maybe walking to the park or corner<br/>\nstore a few blocks from their house (we have both) on quiet residential<br/>\nstreets.  However, when I WAS a ps kid growing up in the city, I would walk<br/>\nto the corner store; two blocks to the beach; take the public bus to and<br/>\nfrom school with my brother starting when we were 6 and 7; and in general<br/>\nrun around with my friends.  Maybe people who let the ps system raise their<br/>\nkids let them do more on their own, because they get into the mentality<br/>\nthat their children don&#39;t need them.

Little Susie fingered the<br/>\n&gt;bright laminated yellow badge that hung around her neck, with a Scarlet<br/>\n&gt;Letter H stamped on the middle and her picture and identification number<br/>\n&gt;below.  Mommy had given it to her after she lost her identification card<br/>\n&gt;and could not leave the house for two weeks until the county issued her a<br/>\n&gt;new one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Timothy reached into his wallet to retrieve his yellow ID card with the<br/>\n&gt;same red H on the front, next to his picture and number.

What&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt;matter with you?  Got bugs down your pants?&quot; he said to Billy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Billy was patting himself down, checking and rechecking pockets, fearfully<br/>\n&gt;glancing at the TPOs as emotion clenched tightly in his throat and tears<br/>\n&gt;began welling in his eyes.  &#39;Please, please, please.....I HAS to be in this<br/>\n&gt;jacket!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Everyone had heard the stories about the Assesment Center where they take<br/>\n&gt;kids who are caught outside during school hours without ID.  Cheryl Smith<br/>\n&gt;had told Billy that she knew a kid who had been picked up by the TPOs, and<br/>\n&gt;she had gone into gory detail about the battery of tests the children must<br/>\n&gt;submit to, and the tests that parents must take, and fines they must pay,<br/>\n&gt;before their children will be released to them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;By this time the TPO in the passenger seat of the patrol car had gotten out<br/>\n&gt;and was making his way around the front of the car toward the children.<br/>\n&gt;&quot;OK, Kids, you know the drill.&quot; he said.<br/>\n&gt;Timothy took Susie&#39;s hand as he walked toward the front end of the car,<br/>\n&gt;glancing worriedly at Billy, who followed still searching his clothes with<br/>\n&gt;a growing look of desperation on his face.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The TPO met them at the front of the car and said &quot;Spread em.&quot;  Timothy let<br/>\n&gt;go of Susie&#39;s hand and they both leaned forward and placed their hands,<br/>\n&gt;wide apart and palms down, on the front of the car and spread their feet<br/>\n&gt;about shoulder width apart.  Susie had to put her hands on the front<br/>\n&gt;bumper, as that was as far as she could reach and the TPO had to stoop to<br/>\n&gt;one knee to check her for weapons or illegal substances.  These two are<br/>\n&gt;clean.&quot; he said to his parter, now standing next to him.  &quot;No weapons, gum,<br/>\n&gt;caffienated substances or other illegals.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When it came Billy&#39;s turn, he was shaking and crying in fear as the TPO<br/>\n&gt;patted him down.  &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; he said when he felt something in Billy&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;back pocket.  He pulled out Billy&#39;s yellow ID card as Billy ventured a<br/>\n&gt;nervous glance at him.  &quot;It was in my pocket!?&quot; Billy shouted, forgetting<br/>\n&gt;himself.  The TPO scowled and Billy fell silent, as waves of relief washed<br/>\n&gt;over him and he closed his eyes to say an incoherent silent prayer of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>thanks.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Well, finish your business outside, and stay off the streets until after 3<br/>\n&gt;PM.&quot; the TPO driving the patrol car called to them gruffly as they drove<br/>\n&gt;off a few minutes later.  Timothy looked at Susie, who&#39;s face was blank and<br/>\n&gt;unreadable as she watched them drive out of sight.  The he ventured a look<br/>\n&gt;in Billy&#39;s direction as he collapsed against the curb, his legs folding<br/>\n&gt;under him.  He laughed nervously as he repeated &quot;In my pocket the whole<br/>\n&gt;time.
