They <br/>\nhad had some success, killing and scalping an Indian man and taking a boy <br/>\nprisoner in December, 1724. On February 20, 1725, they came across an <br/>\nencampment, and hid in the woods until 2 AM. Once they were sure that the <br/>\nenemy was asleep, they fired volleys into the camp, killing 9 Indians and <br/>\nwounding one more. He tried to flee, but was chased down by a dog and killed. <br/>\nThe dead were scalped, and in early March, &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.imaginemaine.com/directories/Archives/Lovewell.html&quot;\">http://www.imaginemaine.com/directories/Archives/Lovewell.html&quot;</a>&gt;Lovewell marched into Boston&lt;/A&gt;, <br/>\nwearing a wig constructed from several scalps, and carrying the plunder from <br/>\nthe raid—blankets, moccasins, snowshoes and rifles.Lovewell’s raids were the <br/>\nfirst recorded instances of Europeans scalping Native Americans. The practice <br/>\nis traditionally associated with North American Indian tribes. Episodes such <br/>\nas this one, however, have led some people to believe that the Europeans <br/>\nactually introduced scalping to America. In 1820, &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thecowshed.tripod.com/native/cutting.htm&quot;\">http://thecowshed.tripod.com/native/cutting.htm&quot;</a>&gt;an Allegheny Seneca <br/>\nchieftain named Cornplanter&lt;/A&gt; claimed that the Indians were peaceful until <br/>\nEuropeans came. There is also some evidence that if they did not invent <br/>\nscalping, European settlers did help to spread the practice &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/research/renotes/rn-09txt.htm&quot;\">http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/research/renotes/rn-09txt.htm&quot;</a>&gt;westward&lt;/A&gt; as they <br/>\nemigrated across the continent. &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.frontpagemag.com/guestcolumnists/garlinghouse/2001/gh05-16-01.htm&quot;\">http://www.frontpagemag.com/guestcolumnists/garlinghouse/2001/gh05-16-01.htm&quot;</a>&gt;The archeological evidence&lt;/A&gt;, however, suggests <br/>\nthat scalping did in fact originate in the Americas, and that it was <br/>\nwidespread long before European contact. Skulls bearing evidence of scalping <br/>\nhave been found throughout the Americas, many of them dating to hundreds of <br/>\nyears before European contact. What the Europeans did introduce was the <br/>\npractice of paying bounties for scalps. These bounties led to an increase in <br/>\nscalpings by white settlers, male and female; &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/divinerights/NativeTruthII.html&quot;\">http://www.geocities.com/divinerights/NativeTruthII.html&quot;</a>&gt;a woman named Hanna Duston&lt;/A&gt; was <br/>\nactually known as &quot;The Hatchet Lady&quot; for her scalping activities. It seems <br/>\nlikely that as scalping by whites became more common, Native Americans may <br/>\nalso have begun taking more scalps, and that tribes which had not previously <br/>\npracticed scalping may have begun to do so in revenge for the scalpings <br/>\ncarried out against their people. If this is the case, then Native Americans <br/>\nand European settlers may actually have taught each other to scalp.<br/>\n<br/>\nSources:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://historychannel.com/tdih/index.html&quot;\">http://historychannel.com/tdih/index.html&quot;</a>&gt;The History Channel&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.imaginemaine.com/directories/Archives/Lovewell.html&quot;\">http://www.imaginemaine.com/directories/Archives/Lovewell.html&quot;</a>&gt;Imagine Maine: Lovewell’s Fight&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thecowshed.tripod.com/native/cutting.htm&quot;\">http://thecowshed.tripod.com/native/cutting.htm&quot;</a>&gt;Cutting to the Chase of a Long-time Debate&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/research/renotes/rn-09txt.htm&quot;\">http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/research/renotes/rn-09txt.htm&quot;</a>&gt;The Earliest Scalping Victim in America&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.frontpagemag.com/guestcolumnists/garlinghouse/2001/gh05-16-01.htm&quot;\">http://www.frontpagemag.com/guestcolumnists/garlinghouse/2001/gh05-16-01.htm&quot;</a>&gt;Scalping: Myth and Reality&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/divinerights/NativeTruthII.html&quot;\">http://www.geocities.com/divinerights/NativeTruthII.html&quot;</a>&gt;Native Truth II&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41211,"nextTopicId":41213}}
