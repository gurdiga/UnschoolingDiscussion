She seems to have the mentality (all my fault) that if she helps mom, she is good, and if she doesn&#39;t she is not good.  How do I wash away this way misguided thought I put into her?  I guess maybe just de-compress as long as it takes?  Now that I&#39;m typing it out.it looks like I want to push her into trust.  I guess I need some de-parenting, huh?  My 8 yo is somewhat this way also but not as intense.  My others are 5 and 2 and demand to be their own person..
