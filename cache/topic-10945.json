Then one <br/>\nday I said &quot;No&quot; to something...I don&#39;t remember what...and she started her <br/>\ntantrum.   She was only wearing a diaper and she THREW her body down onto <br/>\nthe ground with her little face all twisted up and screeching while banging <br/>\nher head, hands and feet on the floor.   I couldn&#39;t help but laugh at her.  <br/>\nShe looked so funny thats all I could do.   Well, she looked up at me like <br/>\n&quot;Thats not the right response&quot;  and tried it again which just made me laugh <br/>\nharder.   She got herself right up off the floor and just stared at me.   <br/>\nShe couldn&#39;t figure out what was wrong with Mommie.  It was great.  After <br/>\nthat every time she would start her tantrums I just blew it off and laughed. <br/>\n   She only had one or two more tantrums before she quit all together.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly<br/>\n(sorry about my grammar -- Its late here =)  )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Annette Naake&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:naake1999@...\">naake1999@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] outwitting those wily  toddlers<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sat, 08 Jul 2000 01:12:00 CDT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I know this sounds strange, but when my 3yo objects to something, what <br/>\n&gt;often<br/>\n&gt;works is to sympathize (&quot;I know it&#39;s really rotten that we have to leave<br/>\n&gt;now, I wish we could stay...&quot; &quot;I would love to get some French fries! I <br/>\n&gt;wish<br/>\n&gt;I had some now!&quot;). It seems to make him feel better than if I try to change<br/>\n&gt;his mind about being unhappy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When he objects to something in a very loud and whiny way, I tell him right<br/>\n&gt;away that he can cry as hard as he wants and it&#39;s not going to change my<br/>\n&gt;mind. (Screaming for candy in the store is one example.) I actually urge<br/>\n&gt;him, very sincerely, to scream and howl as loudly as he can. (Louder!<br/>\n&gt;Louder!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That really seems to take the wind out of his sails for tantrums. It works<br/>\n&gt;for my little guy ... maybe it will help someone else too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As far as not behaving civilly at home...I think we&#39;re pretty tolerant, but<br/>\n&gt;if he completely disrupts dinner, or Tony and I can&#39;t read a book because<br/>\n&gt;Nicky is yelling that he wants to read something else, I take him by the<br/>\n&gt;hand and lead him to his room. I tell him he can rejoin us when he can be<br/>\n&gt;quiet or stop spitting or stop throwing food or whatever (aren&#39;t toddlers<br/>\n&gt;delightful? Well, yes, they can be....). That seems to leave the decision <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;return in his control.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Annette<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Missing old school friends?
