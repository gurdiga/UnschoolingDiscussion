I imagine she&#39;ll fade away pretty quick, although she has called to see how the babies are since they&#39;re so sick..I&#39;ve chatted a couple minutes then said I needed to go even though I didn&#39;t really. But it was nice that she has called all week to check on them, even though she thinks they&#39;re &quot;undiscplined brats!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI stood up for myself this morning with best friend..that was hard...she hung up on me, and hasn&#39;t called even to see how the babies are doing or if I might need to run to store or anything...so...sigh...the final straw with her was actually more than one thing. For nearly two years now we&#39;ve had an agreement where she&#39;d come pick up Sarah and take her to Scouts when Paul is on duty. She called me this morning at 0815. I don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve asked her not to call that early unless it&#39;s really necessary. She just wanted to know if I was awake and would have Sarah ready. Sarah didn&#39;t need to be ready until 1030. I had the alarm set for 0930 in case we all slept, although Gracie usually is awake by then. <br/>\n<br/>\nEspecially with the kids being sick I&#39;m really needing every precious moment of sleep I can get!! <br/>\n<br/>\nSo then after Scouts, she calls and asks what I&#39;m doing...I said I was just about to vacuum Sarah&#39;s room now that I&#39;d cleaned it for her. She said &quot;Why? That&#39;s HER job.&quot; and I just said &quot;You know, I&#39;m allowed to do nice things for my kids every now and again&quot;...she hung up on me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just can&#39;t take the criticism anymore...especially from someone who doesn&#39;t have her OWN life together! I could easily say alot right now, but I think it best I keep my mouth shut. I KNOW I&#39;m not perfect, so who am I to cast stones?! <br/>\n<br/>\nSuffice it to say that while I can&#39;t say that friend and I will never talk again, I&#39;m not going to hold back any more. She tried to say the other day that what I &quot;need&quot; to do right now is put Sarah back in school and Logan into Head Start because of all the stress I&#39;m under and I just said that I&#39;m not about to do that. So she started in on how I&#39;m not doing any &quot;school work&quot; with Sarah anymore and I just stopped her and said that I know what I&#39;m doing, why and how; and I&#39;m not going to argue about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe and I just don&#39;t agree on much of anything, so what&#39;s the point?! <br/>\n<br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Dragging, spinning, twirling, or pushing them until the floor is nice and shiny.  (Just be careful because it can get really slick too, lol.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor carpeted floors, try sticking big loops of duct tape to the kids butts, and having them crawl around &#39;crab style&#39; and try to pick up the dirt!  We have pets, so it turns into a contest of who has the hairiest butt when we&#39;re done.  lol.  It&#39;s not as effecient as a vaccuum, but it&#39;s loads of fun!
