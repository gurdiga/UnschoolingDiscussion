Use them to help yourself learn to be <br/>\nable to come up with fun little games on your own, on the spot, when <br/>\nsomething arises or when you have some waiting time to fill.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuy them used or get them at the library, by the way, they&#39;ve been <br/>\naround a long time and are available all over.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say do not buy miquon or math-u-see. They are both formal math <br/>\nprograms. Kids I know who have had to use math-u-see have ended up just <br/>\nlike most schooled kids with ability to do computations if the problem <br/>\nis presented in the form that they learned it in their &quot;math class&quot; - <br/>\nbut little ability to know when to use a computational skill and little <br/>\nunderstanding of the underlying concepts and therefore relatively quick <br/>\nloss of skill to use it at all. This program has an approach that <br/>\nreally emphasis &quot;how to do&quot; rather than &quot;when or why to do&quot; math and <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t at all promote understanding. Miquon is a bit different because <br/>\nit uses cuisineairre rods and so has that hands-on attribute going for <br/>\nit - BUT there is nothing in the Miquon workbooks - NOTHING - that <br/>\nwould not come up in regular life in a more natural way. My youngest <br/>\ndaughter liked workbooks and I thought the Miquon ones would be good <br/>\nfor her but I discovered one BIG flaw in them - a kid can&#39;t do them <br/>\nalone, there are no directions to the kid - the directions are in the <br/>\nseparate teacher&#39;s guide. And the workbook pages are not at all <br/>\nself-explanatory - there is no way for the kid to know what they&#39;re <br/>\nsupposed to do on a page. The hidden lesson (not very hidden) in this <br/>\nis that you can&#39;t learn without instruction from a parent/teacher. It <br/>\nis the opposite of &quot;empowering the learner.&quot; Bugs me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jul 20, 2004, at 7:06 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -=-Also, are the series of books &quot;Games for..(reading, writing, math)&quot; <br/>\n&gt; a good<br/>\n&gt; resource?-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; About reading and writing, I say NO, no no.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are some games you can pick up without buying a course or a <br/>\n&gt; workbook.<br/>\n&gt; There are games you can just invent, playing with words and sounds and <br/>\n&gt; such.<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] new and intro","postDate":"1090337203","msgId":96558,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjMy4xYmRmOGM1MS4yZTJlOTNiM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":96556,"nextInTopic":96568,"prevInTime":96557,"nextInTime":96559,"topicId":96511,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/20/2004 10:37:09 AM Eastern Daylight Time, jnjstau@gvtc.com writes: Breed  animals and figure out when they are  due.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-399454664\">In a message dated 7/20/2004 10:37:09 AM Eastern Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jnjstau@...\">jnjstau@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nBreed  animals and figure out when they are  due.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nOr VIRTUALLY breed animals and figure out when they&#39;re due.

I have always known I&#39;d<br/>\nhomeschool since my oldest was small and we&#39;ve spend the last 7 year just<br/>\nliving (and adding to our family :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, it seems I&#39;m having a bit of an anxiety attack, and realized I needed<br/>\nto find some like minded support. Unschooling and parenting in a non<br/>\ncoercive way have been our lives, and we will be continuing in this way.<br/>\nBut....with the sudden onslaught from family of &quot;well, she&#39;s 7, NOW WHAT ARE<br/>\nYOU GOING TO DO????&quot; has left me a little rattled and I&#39;m frustrated that I<br/>\nallowed them to rattle me!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However, I feel that in reality what these recent disagreements and<br/>\nconversations have done is pushed me to clarify and strengthen my own<br/>\nbeliefs about the way we &quot;educate&quot; our children. I am happy to have found<br/>\nthis group and look forward to learning from all of you wise people!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My question is I&#39;d like to order some resources now, but wanting some<br/>\nopinions on which books people like best. My daughter has been asking for<br/>\n&quot;number challenges&quot; lately (she came up with this, basically like real life<br/>\nword problems). So, I wondered if she should have access to some of these<br/>\ncool math programs I&#39;ve seen. I showed her (on the interned) and talked to<br/>\nher about Miquon and MathUSee and she says she wants me to get one for her<br/>\nto &quot;play with&quot;. She actually asked for &quot;that number game&quot; for her birthday.<br/>\nSo, I have no problem getting one...do you all have any experiences with<br/>\neither on of these? I&#39;d love to hear opinions on either.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, are the series of books &quot;Games for..(reading, writing, math)&quot; a good<br/>\nresource? How about Family Math? I was attracted to this one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lastly, I know it&#39;s obviously going to depend on his/her interests, but my<br/>\ndaughter doesn&#39;t have any burning interests right now, she just has a<br/>\nbeautiful life playing all day with her brothers and sister.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for a bit of hand holding here. I feel I&#39;m at a point where I&#39;m<br/>\nstruggling a bit now, but truly feel I am going to come through this time<br/>\nmuch more confident and secure in our lifestyle choices.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, if they&#39;d just leave me the hell alone about our upcoming unassisted<br/>\nbirth.......:)<br/>\n&gt; Kristina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

I have always known I&#39;d homeschool since my oldest was small and we&#39;ve spend the last 7 year just living (and adding to our family :)<br/>\n <br/>\nNow, it seems I&#39;m having a bit of an anxiety attack, and realized I needed to find some like minded support. Unschooling and parenting in a non coercive way have been our lives, and we will be continuing in this way. But....with the sudden onslaught from family of &quot;well, she&#39;s 7, NOW WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO????&quot; has left me a little rattled and I&#39;m frustrated that I allowed them to rattle me!! <br/>\n <br/>\nHowever, I feel that in reality what these recent disagreements and conversations have done is pushed me to clarify and strengthen my own beliefs about the way we &quot;educate&quot; our children. I am happy to have found this group and look forward to learning from all of you wise people!<br/>\n <br/>\nMy question is I&#39;d like to order some resources now, but wanting some opinions on which books people like best. My daughter has been asking for &quot;number challenges&quot; lately (she came up with this, basically like real life word problems). So, I wondered if she should have access to some of these cool math programs I&#39;ve seen. I showed her (on the interned) and talked to her about Miquon and MathUSee and she says she wants me to get one for her to &quot;play with&quot;. She actually asked for &quot;that number game&quot; for her birthday. So, I have no problem getting one...do you all have any experiences with either on of these? I&#39;d love to hear opinions on either.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, are the series of books &quot;Games for..(reading, writing, math)&quot; a good resource? How about Family Math? I was attracted to this one.<br/>\n <br/>\nLastly, I just need some validation as to some common things I might want to have around the house for a 7 yo to have access to. I know it&#39;s obviously going to depend on his/her interests, but my daughter doesn&#39;t have any burning interests right now, she just has a beautiful life playing all day with her brothers and sister. <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks for a bit of hand holding here. I feel I&#39;m at a point where I&#39;m struggling a bit now, but truly feel I am going to come through this time much more confident and secure in our lifestyle choices. <br/>\n <br/>\nNow, if they&#39;d just leave me the hell alone about our upcoming unassisted birth.......:) <br/>\nKristina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9543528,"authorName":"Dana Matt","from":"Dana Matt &lt;hoffmanwilson@...&gt;","profile":"hoffmanwilson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] chewing","postDate":"1090277352","msgId":96527,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzE5MjI0OTEyLjk4MzM3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwNDEyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJEMjE5RERBLjUxNUIlaGVhdGhlcmV0dGVAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":96520,"nextInTopic":96553,"prevInTime":96526,"nextInTime":96528,"topicId":96511,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I actually crunch ice because it s 105 degrees here and it s really cooling and nice.
