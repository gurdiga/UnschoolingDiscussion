I will even transport her out to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe call her Nana.  She is about a year old and showed up on our front porch<br/>\nabout 4 months ago and simply never left.  I guilted dh into letting her<br/>\nstay and I took her to the vet to get her fixed.  Of course, she was already<br/>\npregnant and we now have a couple of really cute puppies, bringing our total<br/>\nto 5 medium to large dogs.  Nana is actually the dog I have always wanted.<br/>\nShe stays in the front yard or in the house (One of our psycho dalmations is<br/>\nvery aggressive to her so she can&#39;t be in the back) and never leaves.  She<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t chase cars or people, isn&#39;t a barker, is extremely affectionate with<br/>\nme and the kids, avoids dh entirely.  She has probably been beaten in the<br/>\npast because she is initially very, very submissive.  She is housebroken and<br/>\nvery trainable.  We have lots of animals (cats, rabbits and goats) and other<br/>\nthan herding the cat is no problem whatsoever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am only willing to part with her because I love her so much and I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink living on the front porch of a home is the best for her.  Her pups are<br/>\nbeing trained to hopefully enter a service dog program in a few months.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44982,"nextTopicId":44969}}
