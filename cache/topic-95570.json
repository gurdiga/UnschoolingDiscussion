A child cannot go home whenever<br/>\nhe or she wants. Even when my nephew was having asthama and wanted the<br/>\nschool to call his mom, the school &#39;assessed the situation and decided the<br/>\ncall was unwarranted.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen your children are in public school (2 of my kids have been), the parent<br/>\nlooses the ability to parent the child while the child is on the school<br/>\npremises.  Sometimes depending on the teacher there is collaboration, but<br/>\nmost often the rules, attendance requirements (a tardy officer from the<br/>\nstate may visit your home), discipline (you missed the work while you were<br/>\nout yesterday, so no recess for you) are in motion whether you as a parent<br/>\nare aware of it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy view is that if you are uncoiling, then do it.  That encompasses a<br/>\ncertain &quot;lifestyle&quot; in which you support your children in perusing their<br/>\ngoals.   If your children are in public school, as a parent you must do the<br/>\nsame; make sure they are there on time, have money or a sack lunch ready,<br/>\nhelp them have a place for homework (20 min. per grade, excluding spelling<br/>\npractice and extra projects) and give them the support to finish projects on<br/>\ntime, etc...  The child will suffer at public school if the parent is not<br/>\ninvolved.  For unschooling families, the involvement may be too intrusive.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids do NOT want to go back to public school.  They experienced it.  I do<br/>\nagree with you that for children who want to experience school, the parent<br/>\nshould support the child&#39;s decision.  But be aware: the decision has &#39;rules&#39;<br/>\nattached to it that may affect the parent&#39;s role.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRebeca Z. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":172750465,"authorName":"b229d655@cs.com","from":"b229d655@...","profile":"robeyboyz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: talking to kids about school","postDate":"1086802378","msgId":95581,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ1LmRmNTUzODUuMmRmOGEzY2FAY3MuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":95579,"nextInTopic":95606,"prevInTime":95580,"nextInTime":95582,"topicId":95570,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/9/2004 1:15:04 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

He&#39;s gone to school off and on for the<br/>\nlast few years, some his choice and some mine for a<br/>\nvariety of reasons I may or may not be up to<br/>\ndiscussing later. I was a radical (rabid?) unschooler<br/>\nbefore he went to school. This list has been<br/>\nfantastically helpful to me in both helping me come<br/>\nback to my &quot;roots,&quot; so to speak, and also helping me<br/>\nunderstand and live unschooling in a much deeper, more<br/>\nmeaningful way than I ever could before even when I<br/>\nwas writing articles about unschooling and haranguing<br/>\npeople on a regular basis about how great unschooling<br/>\nis. I&#39;d like to thank you all for your thoughtfulness<br/>\nand mindfulness, and willingness to share it with<br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristi&#39;s post about talking honestly with your kids<br/>\nabout school really resonated with me. There&#39;s a woman<br/>\nin my area, a well known unschooler with grown kids<br/>\nwho&#39;s written books about unschooling. She constantly<br/>\ntells the story of how, when her daughter wanted to go<br/>\nto school, she would sit her down at the kitchen table<br/>\nand, as one poster described, not let her get up to go<br/>\nto the bathroom or get a drink, basically make school<br/>\nseem as miserable as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt always bothered me a lot, even when I was most<br/>\nopposed to kids going to school. The analogy I&#39;ve come<br/>\nup with is, what if your kid started asking if she<br/>\ncould go see a movie? Would you say, &quot;Oh, you think<br/>\nyou want to see a movie, huh? Well, just sit down<br/>\nthere and I&#39;ll show you what a movie is like.&quot; You<br/>\nstick her in a plush seat, turn off all the lights,<br/>\nmake her sit still and be quiet for two hours, and . .<br/>\n. DON&#39;T show her the movie. Then you say with<br/>\nsatisfaction . . . &quot;And she never asked to see a movie<br/>\nagain.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of really good reasons for kids not to<br/>\ngo to school. Resorting to an essentially dishonest<br/>\nargument, tricking kids into thinking that a minor<br/>\ninconvenience (which may or may not even be real -- in<br/>\nmy son&#39;s classroom you could go get a drink of water<br/>\nor go to the bathroom any time you wanted, or carry a<br/>\nwater bottle if you wanted) is the sum total of what<br/>\nschool is about, is really doing both you and your<br/>\nkids a disservice. It&#39;s just as dishonest to stress<br/>\nonly the negative parts of school as it is to be like<br/>\nBarney and make school seem like an earthly paradise. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not talk honestly with your kids about school?<br/>\nTalk about your own school days, what you liked, what<br/>\nyou didn&#39;t? Talk about why you think what you do at<br/>\nhome is a lot more interesting and valuable -- and at<br/>\nthe same time acknowledge that you understand what<br/>\nkids might feel like they&#39;re missing? Try to find out<br/>\nwhat it&#39;s really like at the school in your<br/>\nneighborhood -- the routine, the atmosphere -- and<br/>\ndiscuss what the pros and cons of going to school<br/>\nmight be, without any scare tactics?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if after a thorough, honest discussion your child<br/>\nstill feels she wants to go to school -- well, that<br/>\ntells you something, doesn&#39;t it, about your child and<br/>\nher needs and desires that you didn&#39;t know before. If<br/>\nyou really think it will be irremediably harmful to<br/>\nher, you could still choose not to let her go, and try<br/>\nto meet those needs in other ways. It would probably<br/>\nbe easier than before since with all your honest<br/>\ndiscussions about school you know your child better.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr you could let her try it out, and keep<br/>\ncommunicating honestly and unjudgmentally with her<br/>\nabout her experiences there, what she likes, what she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t. You could support her in her decision to let<br/>\nher learn how she wants, while letting her know that<br/>\nshe can come home any time she wants -- for a day, a<br/>\nweek or forever -- and you will be thrilled to have<br/>\nher. Keep home a really interesting, safe, loving<br/>\nplace. Take her side in any conflicts she has with the<br/>\nschool, while keeping in mind that she may have<br/>\nimportant relationships with adults there that she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want damaged. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool has a lot less power to hurt kids when parents<br/>\naren&#39;t on its side, when kids know they can leave<br/>\nanytime, they can pick and choose which parts of it<br/>\nthey want to do, they can have bad feelings about<br/>\nparts of it and no one will shame them for them. Then<br/>\nit becomes pretty much like just another<br/>\n&quot;extracurricular&quot; experience -- you stay around as<br/>\nlong as it&#39;s still valuable to you, as long as the<br/>\nbenefits outweigh the drawbacks, and leave when that&#39;s<br/>\nno longer true.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the goal is just to have kids say, &quot;You&#39;re right,<br/>\nMom, school is bad,&quot; then sure, go ahead and scare<br/>\nthem into it. If the goal is actually to find out<br/>\nsomething about your kids and what they want, I think<br/>\nyou have to be more honest.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynn<br/>\n<br/>\nkristi wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to sit her at the<br/>\n&gt; table and say &quot;This is what school is like ... oh<br/>\n&gt; you don&#39;t like it? <br/>\n&gt; OK&quot; in order to get her to say no seems like lying,<br/>\n&gt; because in truth,<br/>\n&gt; she might find the negative things coupled with the<br/>\n&gt; positives not to<br/>\n&gt; matter as much.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She might like school enough that waiting<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for the bathroom<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t so bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; if I&#39;m brainwashing<br/>\n&gt; and manipulating her, IMO, I&#39;m not doing her any<br/>\n&gt; better service than<br/>\n&gt; the schools I&#39;m keeping her from.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>another poster wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; When my third son wanted to go to school I told<br/>\n&gt; him we&#39;d &quot;do school&quot;<br/>\n&gt; at home <br/>\n&gt; &gt; first to see if it was what he really wanted.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I got out some workbooks and had him sit at the<br/>\n&gt; table.

I told<br/>\n&gt; him he <br/>\n&gt; &gt; would have to wait three more hours, until lunch.<br/>\n&gt; So he sat back<br/>\n&gt; down. Then he <br/>\n&gt; &gt; started to get up again and I asked what he was<br/>\n&gt; doing. He said he<br/>\n&gt; had to go to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the bathroom. I told him he&#39;d have to sit down and<br/>\n&gt; wait his turn,<br/>\n&gt; because there <br/>\n&gt; &gt; was already one child in the bathroom. This lasted<br/>\n&gt; about 15 min. and<br/>\n&gt; no one <br/>\n&gt; &gt; has ever asked to go to school again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.
