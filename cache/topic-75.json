Do those books belong to you? Cuz I&#39;ll buy &#39;em off you when you&#39;re<br/>\ndone with them! I am having a very difficult time trying to get his books<br/>\nthrough the library. All copies are ALWAYS checked out. I have my name on<br/>\nthe list for one, and I hope to get it in a few days. I checked Amazon.com,<br/>\nbut some are on backorder and might be shipped in 3-5 weeks.  Some aren&#39;t<br/>\neven being printed anymore! I was hoping I wouldn&#39;t have to buy them new.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has any of his books and would be willing to lend them to me, I<br/>\nwill pay for shipping to/from, and I will treat them as if my life depended<br/>\non it!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone? (sniff, sniff)<br/>\n<br/>\n- - - - - - - -<br/>\nRobin Stark</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73,"nextTopicId":63}}
