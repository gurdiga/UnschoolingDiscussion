My first son was an angel, <br/>\nthe most easy going child I have ever met.  I could NOT understand <br/>\nhow people did not want kids, espcially since at that time we wanted <br/>\n6 kids.  But then I had number two and the work increased and he is <br/>\nmuch fiestier, but also more full of life.  I also saw my sister, who <br/>\nwas never sure if she wanted kids have a daughter.  Her husband was <br/>\nnot interested in her and my sister as hard as she tried just does <br/>\nnot have the passion I have.  It is heart breaking to see her <br/>\ndaughter because although she is loved, she will always come after my <br/>\nsister.  In a way, she is an after thought.  I think if my sister <br/>\ncould go back and not have her she would, she may never admit it and <br/>\nI know she loves her now, but still...<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I personally love kids.  However, life would certainly be <br/>\n*easier* without them.  Especially if you are caught up in <br/>\nthe &quot;American Dream&quot; of having more.  Another possiblity, my <br/>\ngirlfriend has been waiting patiently for grandkids for years and <br/>\nfinally her daughther (who is a school teacher and loves kids) told <br/>\nher she was afraid.  Her and her dh were getting along so well, and <br/>\neverything was at such peace she thought it may ruin it.

She went on and on and was fairly demeaning about <br/>\nbeing &quot;just a mom&quot; (she was JUST a secretary who has wrecked at least three <br/>\nhomes by sleeping with her bosses).<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally said to her that her life must be so very empty and again told her <br/>\nhow sorry I was that she didn&#39;t know the joy of being a mother and walked <br/>\naway from her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anything more important than being the very best mother you can <br/>\npossibly be?  I think not.  Children are very special gifts and deserve to be <br/>\ntreated like it.  We are touching the future every day and I don&#39;t understand <br/>\nwhy some people in society don&#39;t see the value in this.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126884268,"authorName":"HMSL2@aol.com","from":"HMSL2@...","profile":"dobsiedoe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] perspective for Laura B.","postDate":"1052458715","msgId":68261,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFmMC44NzlkN2MxLjJiZWM5OGRiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":68212,"nextInTopic":68964,"prevInTime":68260,"nextInTime":68262,"topicId":68107,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Wow, This was an incredible response from Sandra.

Thing is I know im not a failure I have just herd it too many <br/>\ntimes. <br/>\n<br/>\n I have a little sister that this has happened to. She was Athlete, semi <br/>\npopular and pumped to go to college by my Mom. Way too pumped.<br/>\nWell, she graduated after being handed anything and everything Mom couldn&#39;t <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t give us. <br/>\nShe got engaged, ended up being kicked out moved in with me. I asked her to <br/>\nleave she had thousands but would not even buy her own food. She went back <br/>\nhome, almost died from alcohol poising, wedding never happened and boom a <br/>\nyear later same month she is back with me.  <br/>\nIn a financial mess and her with some 5hour a week (lived her 2 1/2 months <br/>\nbefore she landed a job at Victoria Sec) We told her too look for a new <br/>\nplace. That night 100 MPH car crash (she wasn&#39;t driving). I being sister/Mom <br/>\nagain sat at the hospital all night while she is in traction. <br/>\nBack to my house looses her job. Leaves here to live with my Aunt in Rhode <br/>\nIsland and left there on a bad note. Five months later no job and lives in an <br/>\napartment her and her BF can barley afford. <br/>\nNow she is getting a free family trip from his parents, a cosign on a loan <br/>\nand a car and well it may not get paid....<br/>\nI called her tonight and read Sandra&#39;s response she said hey that&#39;s me i said <br/>\nknow that&#39;s why i called, it does sound like the past two years of your life.&lt;<br/>\nsigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing the Top Jock is not worth all the hype in the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 5/8/2003 12:07:29 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 5/8/03 12:16:21 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LauraBourdo@...\">LauraBourdo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;I would never, in a gazillion years, breathe a word of this to either of <br/>\n&gt; my <br/>\n&gt; children, but it&#39;s there like a cancer, inside me.  I wanted a child like <br/>\n&gt; that.  I wanted my offspring to be a credit to me.  I wanted the applause <br/>\n&gt; for <br/>\n&gt; her accomplishments...for me!  And I knew, as I sat there, with an awful <br/>\n&gt; feeling of despair, that I&#39;ll never get that from either of my children <br/>\n&gt; now.  <br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s done, and her brother&#39;s at home -- never to even have a shot at that <br/>\n&gt; sort of acclaim.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Laura, I&#39;m writing without reading any other responses.  I see you have <br/>\n&gt; four <br/>\n&gt; others.  I hope I duplicate what someone has already said.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I want to remind you of some things you already know, in way of mental and <br/>\n&gt; emotional massage.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Step away from the school.  How big must a giant whale seem from the <br/>\n&gt; INSIDE!!!  360 degrees?  No, every direction, up down, squeezing in.  I <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; see a school from my house.  If I stand on TOP of my house I can&#39;t see a <br/>\n&gt; school.  You went and climbed inside one.  Even from the parking lot, a <br/>\n&gt; school is really big.  And you&#39;re looking back on 12 or 13 years of it, so <br/>\n&gt; it <br/>\n&gt; seems OLD and ancient and 3/4 of your daughter&#39;s life.  Breathe, turn your <br/>\n&gt; back, and look how much MORE of her life will be lived away and apart from <br/>\n&gt; school.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Early yesterday morning I was going through some boxes of my old stuff to <br/>\n&gt; consolidate and put away deeper.  Old letters from friends, college and <br/>\n&gt; high <br/>\n&gt; school stuff.  I found a 45 rpm record, still in its mailer, which Matthew <br/>\n&gt; Chacon made, and sent me.  He was the older brother of one of my <br/>\n&gt; boyfriends.  <br/>\n&gt; He was in the same rock&#39;n&#39;roll band as another boyfriend.  He was the <br/>\n&gt; oldest <br/>\n&gt; of five children of a state representative and the most prominent lawyer in <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; town.  Matthew was the student body president.  Matthew made a speech at <br/>\n&gt; graduation (not valedictorian, but president-thing).  Matthew was seen as <br/>\n&gt; having huge potential.   He became a lawyer.  He married someone smart, and <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; pretty.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Matthew&#39;s dead.  But first, he ruined one marriage, everyone was on HER <br/>\n&gt; side, <br/>\n&gt; and he married someone else, and everyone was on HER side, and he used too <br/>\n&gt; many drugs, and he got involved in unscrupulous legal practices, and none <br/>\n&gt; of <br/>\n&gt; our other friends who became lawyers could say &quot;Matthew Chacon&quot; without <br/>\n&gt; shaking their heads in embarrassment.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I liked him, but my sister reminds me it was because I hadn&#39;t seen him for <br/>\n&gt; several years.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So Matthew made a RECORD!  A song he wrote and recorded.  I still have a <br/>\n&gt; copy.  I&#39;d give it to one of his kids, but he didn&#39;t have any.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Was Matthew a success in life?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Not hardly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Todd Petty was a total dweeb in school.  He did model rockets in the back <br/>\n&gt; field, he licked his lip and was awkward and never comfortable and had a <br/>\n&gt; dumb <br/>\n&gt; name (Tom Petty did okay, but &quot;Todd Petty&quot; didn&#39;t impress us.)  BUT, I <br/>\n&gt; never <br/>\n&gt; saw poor Todd lose his temper in the face of lesser beings taunting him and <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; telling him he was an electronics-loving dork.   I never saw him say a mean <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; word to anyone, nor did I ever see him cry or get emotional.  He was a <br/>\n&gt; calm, <br/>\n&gt; thoughtful, Spartan geek. When I asked, friends said he had become a <br/>\n&gt; military <br/>\n&gt; officer (air force or navy, I forget) and was an electronics specialist, <br/>\n&gt; had <br/>\n&gt; grown up strong and buff and ended up making over $80,000 a year before he <br/>\n&gt; was 30 or so.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was popular in school.  I got lots of awards in Jr. High.  I got fewer in <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; high school because I was blackballed by one teacher or more (but it only <br/>\n&gt; took one) from honor society for smoking dope (I heard from one of the <br/>\n&gt; teachers who liked me).  I graduated early and graduated from college at <br/>\n&gt; 20.  <br/>\n&gt;  Now, from the point of view of success-counting, I&#39;m nothing.  My kids are <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; still relatively little while others I went to school with have grown kids <br/>\n&gt; with cool careers they can take credit for (fair or not, they do).  I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; have a job.  With all my potential I never even finished a master&#39;s degree, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; dropped out three times.  So I&#39;m an unemployed dropout without ANY cool job <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; to show, and I got fat.  And I live in Albuquerque (a kind of shame all in <br/>\n&gt; itself, in New Mexico &lt;bwg&gt;).  I wear jeans and I apparently can&#39;t afford <br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; go to a beauty parlor to have my hair done.  (I went to a class reunion <br/>\n&gt; year <br/>\n&gt; before last, and scoped the really nice clothes and hairdos on people who <br/>\n&gt; were non-descript kids in school, while I was all sparkly and <br/>\n&gt; attention-getting.  I went wearing a sweatshirt and jeans, and was one of <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; nominations for the person most changed.  Maybe I won.  I don&#39;t remember.  <br/>\n&gt; Probably not.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And is it all over now?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No.  There will be other comparisons later on.  Maybe I&#39;ll be a published <br/>\n&gt; author with kids who did something impressive next time there&#39;s a reunion, <br/>\n&gt; and some of those who were at the top of the wheel of fortune will be <br/>\n&gt; bankrupt or have suffered strokes or wrecked their nice cars.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Things aren&#39;t stable.  The moment of high school graduation is a <br/>\n&gt; significant <br/>\n&gt; moment for someone who has been promised that release for their whole <br/>\n&gt; remembered lives.  But in retrospect it&#39;s just a moment. The next moment is <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; more real.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t get attached to how she is now.  Don&#39;t get attached to how she is on <br/>\n&gt; August 3 of this year.  She might sleep all day and have the flu, and watch <br/>\n&gt; a <br/>\n&gt; movie you think is stupid.  Don&#39;t get attached to how she is on her wedding <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; day.  Don&#39;t get attached to the vision of her on the day you see her the <br/>\n&gt; most <br/>\n&gt; happy she has ever been.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; None of those moments is permanent and they are all just a passing glimpse <br/>\n&gt; of <br/>\n&gt; who she is.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some of those poor kids who got awards are just moving in to the phase <br/>\n&gt; where <br/>\n&gt; they will be pressured to do more of the same, get college awards, become <br/>\n&gt; professional basketball players (or whatever), coach winning teams.  What?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You didn&#39;t?  You failure.  You wasted your potential.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some high school success is just the future-failure switch being screwed in <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; place for life.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95003301,"authorName":"Tammy in MS","from":"&quot;Tammy in MS&quot; &lt;qpwithcheese@...&gt;","profile":"tammyof4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] perspective for Laura B.","postDate":"1052441444","msgId":68212,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFQkFGQjY0LjAwMDAwNC4wMzY0MEByb3NpZT4=","referencesHeader":"PDNFQkFGOTk5LkNFQzRGNkE1QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":68211,"nextInTopic":68261,"prevInTime":68211,"nextInTime":68213,"topicId":68107,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"lol.. yeah.. hey, who knows...maybe one day???

How big must a giant whale seem from the \r<br/>\nINSIDE!!! 360 degrees? No, every direction, up down, squeezing in. I can&#39;t \r<br/>\nsee a school from my house. If I stand on TOP of my house I can&#39;t see a \r<br/>\nschool. You went and climbed inside one. Even from the parking lot, a \r<br/>\nschool is really big. And you&#39;re looking back on 12 or 13 years of it, so it<br/>\n\r<br/>\nseems OLD and ancient and 3/4 of your daughter&#39;s life. Breathe, turn your \r<br/>\nback, and look how much MORE of her life will be lived away and apart from \r<br/>\nschool.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nEarly yesterday morning I was going through some boxes of my old stuff to \r<br/>\nconsolidate and put away deeper. Old letters from friends, college and high \r<br/>\nschool stuff. I found a 45 rpm record, still in its mailer, which Matthew \r<br/>\nChacon made, and sent me. He was the older brother of one of my boyfriends. \r<br/>\nHe was in the same rock&#39;n&#39;roll band as another boyfriend. He was the oldest \r<br/>\nof five children of a state representative and the most prominent lawyer in \r<br/>\ntown. Matthew was the student body president. Matthew made a speech at \r<br/>\ngraduation (not valedictorian, but president-thing). Matthew was seen as \r<br/>\nhaving huge potential. He became a lawyer. He married someone smart, and \r<br/>\npretty.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nMatthew&#39;s dead. But first, he ruined one marriage, everyone was on HER side,<br/>\n\r<br/>\nand he married someone else, and everyone was on HER side, and he used too \r<br/>\nmany drugs, and he got involved in unscrupulous legal practices, and none of<br/>\n\r<br/>\nour other friends who became lawyers could say &quot;Matthew Chacon&quot; without \r<br/>\nshaking their heads in embarrassment.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI liked him, but my sister reminds me it was because I hadn&#39;t seen him for \r<br/>\nseveral years.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nSo Matthew made a RECORD! A song he wrote and recorded. I still have a \r<br/>\ncopy. I&#39;d give it to one of his kids, but he didn&#39;t have any.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nWas Matthew a success in life?\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nNot hardly.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nTodd Petty was a total dweeb in school. He did model rockets in the back \r<br/>\nfield, he licked his lip and was awkward and never comfortable and had a<br/>\ndumb \r<br/>\nname (Tom Petty did okay, but &quot;Todd Petty&quot; didn&#39;t impress us.) BUT, I never \r<br/>\nsaw poor Todd lose his temper in the face of lesser beings taunting him and \r<br/>\ntelling him he was an electronics-loving dork. I never saw him say a mean \r<br/>\nword to anyone, nor did I ever see him cry or get emotional. He was a calm, \r<br/>\nthoughtful, Spartan geek. When I asked, friends said he had become a<br/>\nmilitary \r<br/>\nofficer (air force or navy, I forget) and was an electronics specialist, had<br/>\n\r<br/>\ngrown up strong and buff and ended up making over $80,000 a year before he \r<br/>\nwas 30 or so.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI was popular in school. I got lots of awards in Jr. High. I got fewer in \r<br/>\nhigh school because I was blackballed by one teacher or more (but it only \r<br/>\ntook one) from honor society for smoking dope (I heard from one of the \r<br/>\nteachers who liked me). I graduated early and graduated from college at 20. \r<br/>\nNow, from the point of view of success-counting, I&#39;m nothing. My kids are \r<br/>\nstill relatively little while others I went to school with have grown kids \r<br/>\nwith cool careers they can take credit for (fair or not, they do). I don&#39;t \r<br/>\nhave a job. With all my potential I never even finished a master&#39;s degree, \r<br/>\ndropped out three times. So I&#39;m an unemployed dropout without ANY cool job \r<br/>\nto show, and I got fat. And I live in Albuquerque (a kind of shame all in \r<br/>\nitself, in New Mexico &lt;bwg&gt;). I wear jeans and I apparently can&#39;t afford to \r<br/>\ngo to a beauty parlor to have my hair done. (I went to a class reunion year \r<br/>\nbefore last, and scoped the really nice clothes and hairdos on people who \r<br/>\nwere non-descript kids in school, while I was all sparkly and \r<br/>\nattention-getting. I went wearing a sweatshirt and jeans, and was one of the<br/>\n\r<br/>\nnominations for the person most changed. Maybe I won. I don&#39;t remember. \r<br/>\nProbably not. \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nAnd is it all over now? \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nNo. There will be other comparisons later on. Maybe I&#39;ll be a published \r<br/>\nauthor with kids who did something impressive next time there&#39;s a reunion, \r<br/>\nand some of those who were at the top of the wheel of fortune will be \r<br/>\nbankrupt or have suffered strokes or wrecked their nice cars. \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nThings aren&#39;t stable. The moment of high school graduation is a significant \r<br/>\nmoment for someone who has been promised that release for their whole \r<br/>\nremembered lives. But in retrospect it&#39;s just a moment. The next moment is \r<br/>\nmore real.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nDon&#39;t get attached to how she is now. Don&#39;t get attached to how she is on \r<br/>\nAugust 3 of this year. She might sleep all day and have the flu, and watch a<br/>\n\r<br/>\nmovie you think is stupid. Don&#39;t get attached to how she is on her wedding \r<br/>\nday. Don&#39;t get attached to the vision of her on the day you see her the most<br/>\n\r<br/>\nhappy she has ever been.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nNone of those moments is permanent and they are all just a passing glimpse<br/>\nof \r<br/>\nwho she is. \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nSome of those poor kids who got awards are just moving in to the phase where<br/>\n\r<br/>\nthey will be pressured to do more of the same, get college awards, become \r<br/>\nprofessional basketball players (or whatever), coach winning teams. What? \r<br/>\nYou didn&#39;t? You failure.

It&#39;s <br/>\nhumbling to realize that, despite my commitment to unschooling values, I can <br/>\nstill get sucked into judging success based on those warped standards.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s even more humbling is the realization that what I experienced last <br/>\nnight was really more about me than it was about her.  I was jealous of those <br/>\nparents whose kids took home all the honors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unschooling way of looking at things -- that it&#39;s all about being present <br/>\nto your child exactly where they&#39;re at at any given moment, and not where you <br/>\nimagine they *should* be -- is an amazing paradigm shift for me.  Part of <br/>\nwhat I think I experienced last night was a letting go of those expectations <br/>\nfor my son -- since we&#39;re committed to the unschooling path for him.  And <br/>\nthere was some grief there, even if it isn&#39;t rational.    What I hadn&#39;t <br/>\nrealized, though, was that there are aspects of the schooled way of looking <br/>\nat life that I was still having a terribly hard time letting go of.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was uncomfortable, but good for me, I think -- both in terms of the way I <br/>\ncontinue to support my dd in the future and in the unschooling of my ds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your sharing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] perspective for Laura B.","postDate":"1052414461","msgId":68128,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZWEwMWMzMTU4NyQyNmFmNTk2MCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDE3Mi4xYTBkZDlhMy4yYmViZGExMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68107,"nextInTopic":68152,"prevInTime":68127,"nextInTime":68129,"topicId":68107,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Great perspective post snipped. ... in ...

Old letters from friends, college and high <br/>\nschool stuff.  I found a 45 rpm record, still in its mailer, which Matthew <br/>\nChacon made, and sent me.  He was the older brother of one of my boyfriends.  <br/>\nHe was in the same rock&#39;n&#39;roll band as another boyfriend.  He was the oldest <br/>\nof five children of a state representative and the most prominent lawyer in <br/>\ntown.  Matthew was the student body president.  Matthew made a speech at <br/>\ngraduation (not valedictorian, but president-thing).  Matthew was seen as <br/>\nhaving huge potential.    He became a lawyer.  He married someone smart, and <br/>\npretty.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatthew&#39;s dead.  But first, he ruined one marriage, everyone was on HER side, <br/>\nand he married someone else, and everyone was on HER side, and he used too <br/>\nmany drugs, and he got involved in unscrupulous legal practices, and none of <br/>\nour other friends who became lawyers could say &quot;Matthew Chacon&quot; without <br/>\nshaking their heads in embarrassment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked him, but my sister reminds me it was because I hadn&#39;t seen him for <br/>\nseveral years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Matthew made a RECORD!  A song he wrote and recorded.  I still have a <br/>\ncopy.  I&#39;d give it to one of his kids, but he didn&#39;t have any.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas Matthew a success in life?<br/>\n<br/>\nNot hardly.<br/>\n<br/>\nTodd Petty was a total dweeb in school.  He did model rockets in the back <br/>\nfield, he licked his lip and was awkward and never comfortable and had a dumb <br/>\nname (Tom Petty did okay, but &quot;Todd Petty&quot; didn&#39;t impress us.)  BUT, I never <br/>\nsaw poor Todd lose his temper in the face of lesser beings taunting him and <br/>\ntelling him he was an electronics-loving dork.   I never saw him say a mean <br/>\nword to anyone, nor did I ever see him cry or get emotional.  He was a calm, <br/>\nthoughtful, Spartan geek. When I asked, friends said he had become a military <br/>\nofficer (air force or navy, I forget) and was an electronics specialist, had <br/>\ngrown up strong and buff and ended up making over $80,000 a year before he <br/>\nwas 30 or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was popular in school.  I got lots of awards in Jr. High.  I got fewer in <br/>\nhigh school because I was blackballed by one teacher or more (but it only <br/>\ntook one) from honor society for smoking dope (I heard from one of the <br/>\nteachers who liked me).  I graduated early and graduated from college at 20.  <br/>\n  Now, from the point of view of success-counting, I&#39;m nothing.  My kids are <br/>\nstill relatively little while others I went to school with have grown kids <br/>\nwith cool careers they can take credit for (fair or not, they do).  I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave a job.  With all my potential I never even finished a master&#39;s degree, <br/>\ndropped out three times.  So I&#39;m an unemployed dropout without ANY cool job <br/>\nto show, and I got fat.  And I live in Albuquerque (a kind of shame all in <br/>\nitself, in New Mexico &lt;bwg&gt;).  I wear jeans and I apparently can&#39;t afford to <br/>\ngo to a beauty parlor to have my hair done.  (I went to a class reunion year <br/>\nbefore last, and scoped the really nice clothes and hairdos on people who <br/>\nwere non-descript kids in school, while I was all sparkly and <br/>\nattention-getting.  I went wearing a sweatshirt and jeans, and was one of the <br/>\nnominations for the person most changed.  Maybe I won.  I don&#39;t remember.  <br/>\nProbably not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd is it all over now?  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo.  There will be other comparisons later on.  Maybe I&#39;ll be a published <br/>\nauthor with kids who did something impressive next time there&#39;s a reunion, <br/>\nand some of those who were at the top of the wheel of fortune will be <br/>\nbankrupt or have suffered strokes or wrecked their nice cars.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThings aren&#39;t stable.  The moment of high school graduation is a significant <br/>\nmoment for someone who has been promised that release for their whole <br/>\nremembered lives.  But in retrospect it&#39;s just a moment. The next moment is <br/>\nmore real.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t get attached to how she is now.  Don&#39;t get attached to how she is on <br/>\nAugust 3 of this year.  She might sleep all day and have the flu, and watch a <br/>\nmovie you think is stupid.  Don&#39;t get attached to how she is on her wedding <br/>\nday.  Don&#39;t get attached to the vision of her on the day you see her the most <br/>\nhappy she has ever been.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of those moments is permanent and they are all just a passing glimpse of <br/>\nwho she is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of those poor kids who got awards are just moving in to the phase where <br/>\nthey will be pressured to do more of the same, get college awards, become <br/>\nprofessional basketball players (or whatever), coach winning teams.
