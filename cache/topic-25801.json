It would be tremendously helpful if anyone is willing to <br/>\n&gt;share why they believe unschooling is the best way to go.  Why not <br/>\n&gt;the Charlotte Mason approach?  Or the Moore Formula?  Why do you <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;believe what you believe?  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;Sheila<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I personally believe this:  Nobody&#39;s &#39;approach&#39;  is right for my family<br/>\nexcept ours.  We run pretty much as a democracy with a few exceptions. <br/>\nThis description is all general and subject to fluidity on any given day.<br/>\n My personal input into the family is as organizer.  I keep us all on<br/>\ntrack and moving.  The kids each have different jobs.  Rachel is in<br/>\ncharge of outside stuff for the most part although some of the gardens<br/>\nare mine.  Jenni is in charge of books (becasue she has read them all)<br/>\nand a lot of inside stuff.  Wyndham is in charge of making Wyndham grow<br/>\nup.  When the girls were his age they went through similar albeit less<br/>\ntroublesome phases.  We have a job list and some basic guidelines for<br/>\ngetting the housework done fairly.  But none of that has anything to do<br/>\nwith &#39;education&#39;.  As for learning and schoolwork, our lifestyle is a<br/>\nlittle less easy to explain.  I do require that my girls be doing<br/>\nsomething.  I have some basic suggestions loosely attached to the<br/>\njobslist but they can and often do fly out the window.  Rachel has a<br/>\nviolin she is learning to play and if she is doing that, I&#39;m happy with<br/>\nit.  If she were vegging out and not doing ANYTHING for a prolonged<br/>\nperiod of time, I would worry and check into her allergy and depression<br/>\nlevels.  So the list and the requirement for &#39;something&#39; is more a<br/>\nmedical watch thing than it is about school work.  <br/>\nBut then the dynamics here are a bit odd too.  Rachel and Wyndham (oldest<br/>\nand youngest) have most of the medical problems and are most physically<br/>\nactive.  The middle one, Jenni, often ends up holding things together and<br/>\nhelping me the most but for anyone looking in from the outside it appears<br/>\nshe is not doing much.  <br/>\nThe so called basic school stuff, math, history, english, etc. are so<br/>\nmeshed into our lives that I can&#39;t even say this is what we do to teach<br/>\nthat.  I just know that my uncle was astounded at Rachel&#39;s knowledge of<br/>\nhistory and politics a week or so ago.  I didn&#39;t &#39;teach&#39; her that.  She<br/>\njust &#39;is&#39; that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my best advice is to figure out what works for you.  Don&#39;t try to<br/>\nassign names to it (because someone somewhere will try to tell you that<br/>\nthat isn&#39;t what you are doing) and just do it and don&#39;t look back.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~   F u cn rd ths u cnt spl wrth a dm! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nIf electricity comes from electrons . . .<br/>\n . . . does that mean that morality comes from morons?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25799,"nextTopicId":25806}}
