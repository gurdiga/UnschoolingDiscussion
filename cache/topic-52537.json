Maybe south of Beverley.  But if it&#39;s at one <br/>\nSafeway, it might be at most).   On packaging, if it says &quot;chile verde&quot; it&#39;s <br/>\nprobably a green chile sauce for cooking.  If it says &quot;green chile&quot; it&#39;s <br/>\nprobably the ingredient itself, just canned.   Just like England brought <br/>\nNorman words in and let the Anglo-Saxon word mean one thing and the Norman <br/>\nFrench word mean something slightly different, New Mexico does that with <br/>\nSpanish and English sometimes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne VERY common thing to do with it here is to put it on cheeseburgers.   The <br/>\nlocal hamburger chains will ask if you want green chile, very often (it&#39;s ten <br/>\nor fifteen cents exta sometimes, or free) and even the national chains might <br/>\nhave it sometimes.   At a restaurant you might be asked simply &quot;red or <br/>\ngreen?&quot; meaning what kind of sauce you want on a plate meal.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you get it in England, it would be good mixed with eggs with that <br/>\nREALLY good bacon you have there.  We have nothing like that here.  A <br/>\nteaspoonful of chile&#39;s a good single-dose for eggs or a sandwich.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn an enchilada plate, it will have about half a cup of sauce or more.  Lots. <br/>\n It&#39;s okay to leave lots of it there if you need to. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8037645,"authorName":"elaine greenwood-hyde","from":"&quot;elaine greenwood-hyde&quot; &lt;elainegh8@...&gt;","profile":"elainegh8","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Green chili + Ren ( or lack of )","postDate":"1040372437","msgId":52537,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYzNlhmeVkwUVVVQlBjWmk3MW0wMDAwZTkxM0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":52554,"prevInTime":52536,"nextInTime":52538,"topicId":52537,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I m sure you must be able to get some.
