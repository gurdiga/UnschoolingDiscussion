Someday he&#39;ll move out (Will did just 10 wks after his 18th), and having him gone will be a really new thing!  I found it felt surreal not having Will around the house -- he was gone several months before we cleared out his room to move Dan in there.  The closet is still full of his stuff -- I went thru it just last week to find some clothes for Andy.<br/>\n <br/>\nEven weirder is talking to him when he calls -- he&#39;s busy, what with work, friends, days on a shared boat on the lake.  I find that I spend days literally feeling his childhood -- I can smell it, even see him as a little guy.  It all went by way too fast for me, tho as he&#39;s pointed out it went by slowly for him!<br/>\n <br/>\nAh well, gotta go -- the ones still at home are calling out that they&#39;re hungry.  Dan said the reason he&#39;s hungry is &#39;because I didn&#39;t get a bowling shirt&#39; (Andy just dug out one from last summer).  Poor guy!<br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n <br/>\n***********<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nThere are no new barriers for him to cross, really, so it seems kind of sad to penalize him for having a birthday, by NOT giving him the annual allowance increase, but cutting it off altogether.

Now that I type<br/>\nthat, it was also true when they were babies and toddlers . . . things that<br/>\nI was SO sure I would not do or my children would not do (remember I was 34<br/>\nwhen Sky was born and had seen many parents and children around me) or that<br/>\nI would do or my children would do . . . it all came around to be put in<br/>\nfront of me - and I had to made consistently conscious choices in that<br/>\nmoment.. . . based on nothing that I had seen or experienced, just<br/>\nfollowing my heart and my instincts. Sometimes it was easy, sometimes it<br/>\ninvolved me eating my words or my thoughts.

To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of Coca-Cola <br/>\nover the terminals to bubble away the corrosion.  <br/>\nWe actually have a rusty old dead car battery in the garage. Tried it. <br/>\nThought it’d be cool. It didn’t work. But then I tried it with some Reynold’s wrap <br/>\n(no Coke) and it came off beautifully. Maybe we should be worried about the <br/>\nReynold’s wrap here. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nanother quote from that one:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Tried the laundry one. It didn’t work. Except the road haze one kinda did. <br/>\nBut it left my windshield all sticky. Next time I used Windex, and that REALLY <br/>\nworked (who knew?). A lot better than sticky brown pop. Who are all these <br/>\npeople trying this stuff on their windows and batteries and stuff? Or are they <br/>\njust claiming they’ve tried it in the hopes that some doofus like me will copy <br/>\nthem?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n------<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve rejected two pending posts that recommended pouring coke on a corroded  <br/>\ncar battery.  If you&#39;re out in the mountains and your battery is so corroded <br/>\nyour car won&#39;t start, pour any liquid you have on it.  But if you have plain <br/>\nwater, that&#39;s best.   Or rub the corrosion off with pine needles, but if any <br/>\ngets on your hands RINSE THEM A LOT.   The white battery acid leakage buildup is <br/>\nacidic.  It needs BASE to clean it off, not more acid.  The coke is less <br/>\nacidic than the corrosion, which is why it will work better than nothing.  But it&#39;s <br/>\nfar from being a useful/necessary/efficient treatment.   Water and baking s<br/>\noda have been used cheaply, commonly, by lots of garage mechanics who are where <br/>\nthey have lots of options (at home, at work, not stuck out in the country).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s from the Jaguar site:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-1.  Make sure the terminals are clean. Batteries typically produce a white <br/>\nfluffy  corrosion, and this corrosion acts as an insulator, preventing full <br/>\nbattery power from  reaching the starter. This makes the car act like the <br/>\nbattery is weak. Unbolt the  terminals and clean them with a mixture of water and <br/>\nbaking soda. WEAR EYE PROTECTION AND  RUBBER GLOVES.  Wash down the battery <br/>\ncase with more water and baking soda. You can buy a  corrosion inhibitor at your <br/>\nlocal parts store. spray it on when you reattach the battery  cables.   -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nChampion Auto&#39;s site:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Clean battery terminals are necessary to deliver your battery&#39;s full p<br/>\nand keep it fully charged. Battery terminals may be cleaned by use<br/>\nbattery terminal cleaner, or washing with a solution of baking soda<br/>\nwater and brushed clean.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy pour something sticky in or on ANY part of an engine?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if anyone here still thinks pouring something sugary and thick on a <br/>\nbattery is a great idea, please discuss it somewhere else, as it doesn&#39;t help <br/>\nanyone unschool. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96879,"nextTopicId":96928}}
