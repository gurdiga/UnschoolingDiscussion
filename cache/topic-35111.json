This functioned really well though the <br/>\nwinter.  They take turns with some jobs and it was good way to keep <br/>\ntrack of whose turn it was.  A lot of the reason it worked so well was <br/>\nbecause one glance at the list showed who was or wasn&#39;t helping out.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, now that it is spring, I think things are going to have to <br/>\nchange.

But are forced chores the only<br/>\nroute to that?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs a goal of everyone pitching in with an amount of work that feels<br/>\nsufficient to the adults the same as an atmosphere of teamwork?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if, to fulfill a dream he&#39;d never discussed with you, your husband<br/>\nbought a new house way out in the middle of no where that had no<br/>\nelectricity, no running water, no conveniences and decided you would live<br/>\nthere with him. Would it be then your responsibility to pitch in and help<br/>\nhim live the life he&#39;d chosen for the two of you? Or would it look like some<br/>\nbizarre power trip?<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t that kind of the deal that kids get? They didn&#39;t get to choose which<br/>\nfamilies to be born into. They didn&#39;t get to say &quot;I love a sense of order so<br/>\nI want that house where the toys are never to be left out past 5PM.&quot; ;-)<br/>\n*We* chose to bring them into the world, into the lifestyle and standards we<br/>\nchoose to keep. We may have chosen a big back yard for them but do they then<br/>\ninherit the responsibility for our gift to them? Isn&#39;t everything we provide<br/>\nour gift to them? We are providing a life that *we* want to give to them:<br/>\nthe size of the house, the number and type of meals, the separate bedrooms.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe *they&#39;d* prefer everyone slept in the same room so what kind of gift<br/>\nhave we really given? Why should we assume they even want what we are giving<br/>\nthem? Just because it&#39;s a gift *we* would like to be given, do they then<br/>\nbecome obligated to appreciate it just because we worked so hard to get it<br/>\nfor them? And why do we attach strings to our gifts?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could say, &quot;Tough, that&#39;s just how life is,&quot; but isn&#39;t that just one of<br/>\nthose things people say when they want to force someone else to do what they<br/>\nwant them to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich isn&#39;t a way of saying parents should become the servants of children.<br/>\nIt&#39;s just a way of viewing the situation from the kids&#39; point of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we say they have a responsibility, do they also have equal say in how the<br/>\nhouse is kept? If they don&#39;t like mowing the lawn, could they choose to turn<br/>\nit into a meadow? If they prefer to have their projects spread out in front<br/>\nof the TV is that preference treated equally with adult preference to have<br/>\nthem cleaned up?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean the kid preferences should supercede the adult<br/>\npreferences, but if two adults had different preferences would the way of<br/>\nresolving the conflict be for one adult to assert power and force over the<br/>\nother adult to make the second adult do what the first wanted? (Well, yeah,<br/>\nand we call it war! Or slavery.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBy insisting that the only right way is the adult way, and because I&#39;m right<br/>\nI then get to force you to do it my way, aren&#39;t we essentially saying<br/>\nthrough our actions -- since the more strongly we feel we&#39;re right the less<br/>\nlikely we are to find any other method of resolive the conflict -- that the<br/>\nbest way to solve differences of opinion is by being the bigger, stronger,<br/>\nmore forceful one? Aren&#39;t we robbing them of the opportunity to see real<br/>\nproblem solving in action, resolving conflicts over things we really care<br/>\nabout?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; While this seems like a reasonable theory to me it&#39;s nothing but a battle<br/>\n&gt; in reality.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And when you step back and look at it objectively as one side setting the<br/>\nstandards, setting how to meet those standards and enforcing them, should it<br/>\nbe any other way?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if the kids set the standards and insisted you should comply with their<br/>\nstandards and how to meet those standards?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if your husband decided he didn&#39;t like seeing the food processor that<br/>\nyou use everyday sitting out on the counter and insisted you needed to take<br/>\nit out and put it away for every use. And the only place it fit was on a<br/>\nhigh shelf you needed to get the step ladder for? What if he insisted the<br/>\ngarage floor needed scrubbed by hand once a week?<br/>\n<br/>\nThose sound ridiculous, and yet the standards we set are just as ridiculous<br/>\nfrom kid points of view. Kids don&#39;t care if the toilet is clean or the beds<br/>\nare made or they have to wade through a floor full of toys. From their point<br/>\nof view it&#39;s ridiculous to put away things that they&#39;re just going to take<br/>\nout tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Housework is not high on our list of favorite things to do<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You could put on lively music. You could put on show tunes and sing. You<br/>\ncould put a book on tape on. That won&#39;t *turn* it into fun. But we choose<br/>\nwhat attitudes we bring to whatever we&#39;re doing. We can choose to be less<br/>\ngrumpy about housework.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also see what can be done to simplify the tasks. Like rather than<br/>\nhaving one laundry basket, have one for each child. That way the clothes are<br/>\nalready sorted. Someone had their house set up so all the clothes were<br/>\nstored in the laundry room. Brainstorm wild ideas at home. Bring some here<br/>\nand brainstorm.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s real easy to say no, such and such won&#39;t work because it&#39;s real easy to<br/>\nget trapped by the boxes we live in without even realizing the boxes are<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but <br/>\n&gt; there are things in life that have to be done whether we like them or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is that really true? Can you name anything that you *have* to do whether you<br/>\nlike it or not? Give it a try :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t we *choose* to do those things because we prefer the onerous task to<br/>\nthe even more onerous consequences of not doing it?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople often equate the responsibility of kids going to school with adults<br/>\ngoing to work. But the *huge* difference is that the adults chose the type<br/>\nof work they would do, chose the place of business they&#39;d work at, could<br/>\nchoose at any time to go work somewhere else or even stop working and live<br/>\noff savings. Kids have *none* of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we get a shift in outlook when we realize that *everything* we do is<br/>\na choice. There is no have to except dying. Not even paying taxes is a have<br/>\nto. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If there is a way to make cleaning the toilet fun please let me know! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What I do is while I&#39;m waiting that minute for the water to heat up for my<br/>\nshower I grab the spray bottle of cleaner and a paper towel and clean one<br/>\n*small* portion of the bathroom, like just the spot between the seat and the<br/>\ntank, *or* the spot on the floor to the right of *or* left of *or* behind<br/>\nthe toilet, *or* just the rim, *or* just the track for the shower doors *or*<br/>\nwhatever else is a bit dirty.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wipe down a *small* portion of the shower afterwards with Soft Scrub,<br/>\nlet it dry and wipe it off later. (I have one of those shower hose<br/>\nattachments to make rinsing lots easier.) (The waiting part probably<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t work if there are lots of people in the house using the shower so<br/>\nI&#39;d just skip the drying and just wipe.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bathroom is never entirely clean but it also never gets to the state<br/>\nwhere I&#39;d suggest drop in guests might prefer to use the washroom at the gas<br/>\nstation down the street. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAdmittedly that doesn&#39;t take care of the inside of the toilet, but it makes<br/>\nit less onerous if it&#39;s not the toilet *and* everything else too. So the<br/>\nonly other toilet tip is to get one of those toilet brushes that stores in<br/>\nthe container that flips closed when you stand the brush up in it so you<br/>\nnever have to deal with the drippy disgusting thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If one <br/>\n&gt; of them is supposed to do the dishes so their dad can make dinner when he<br/>\n&gt; gets home then it would be considerate if they were done.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve noticed something I do that should have been obvious. I&#39;d like to be<br/>\nasleep by 9 (for various reasons). That doesn&#39;t have to be my daughter&#39;s<br/>\nbedtime but she wants to be read to at night in bed. So if she&#39;s jumping on<br/>\nthe bed and running around at 9 -- which if I read to her then doesn&#39;t to<br/>\nher qualify as reading in bed -- I&#39;m not going to have the light out at 9.<br/>\nSo I say essentially &quot;Please lay down. You say you want reading at night.<br/>\nYou said you&#39;d help me get to sleep by 9.&quot; But what I&#39;ve done  by saying<br/>\nthat is turn *her* into the problem. What I should say is &quot;Will you help me<br/>\nget to bed by 9?&quot; and she becomes part of the solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you could say &quot;Can we help dad get dinner ready by getting these dishes<br/>\nout of the way?&quot; Or you could talk to the kids and find ways other ways so<br/>\nthe dishes don&#39;t pile up and otherwise &quot;help dad get dinner read&quot;. Or<br/>\ncreative ways that the task could get done much quicker (like different bins<br/>\nfor different dishes -- glasses all in one -- so more kids could help). Or<br/>\nif you do it with them, it could be a special time one on one with a child<br/>\nto talk about things. Make them part of the solution instead of part of the<br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also helps if you appreciate what help they give rather than pointing out<br/>\nthat they didn&#39;t meet your standards of enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt won&#39;t happen instantaneously. If you ask for help, they will hear<br/>\ncommands because they&#39;ve always heard commands. And for a while they will<br/>\ntake the freedom to say no, to literally say no. But if they do feel like<br/>\nthey&#39;re equal partners in the endeavor, and the help they give is<br/>\nappreciated, they will come around.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":75245814,"authorName":"bugz","from":"bugz &lt;bugz@...&gt;","profile":"bugz42","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Chores","postDate":"1020387272","msgId":36686,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4wLjI1LjIuMjAwMjA1MDIxMjAxMjIuMDBiMDE4MDhAbWFpbC5yZWRyaXZlcm5ldC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEYzM1d4RFFRUkEwVk92cm9lOFYwMDAwOGQyNUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":36668,"nextInTopic":36721,"prevInTime":36685,"nextInTime":36687,"topicId":35111,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello everyone, I m new here and have been lurking for a short time.
