Sorry if this <br/>\nis a repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Debbie, we brought my two oldest children back home when <br/>\nthey where going into 5th and 3rd grades.  That was 12 years ago, my <br/>\ntwo younger children went to preschool for a couple of years before I <br/>\nknew better then to succumb to in-law pressure.  My children are <br/>\nJames - 22 and not living at home, Angie  20, Monique  16 and Tony <br/>\n 14 (who gave us a scare over reading, but taught me to trust my <br/>\ninstincts.)  My DH is a contract programmer and we have been married <br/>\n16 + years.  He is the love of my life and truly my other half.  We <br/>\nlive in Riverside Co., Ca. with two cats, a gecko, and some fish.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy family has been supportive of our homeschooling but our <br/>\nunschooling was a bit hard for them to understand at first.  My in-<br/>\nlaws have come around these last few years after coming to our HS <br/>\nsupport group activities.  I have had on-line support for years but <br/>\nit was only after our move 5 years ago that I was able to find a <br/>\nsupport group of like-minded HSers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am at a point in my life (45) that I feel like one of the sweet <br/>\nlittle old ladies who wants to tell young unsuspecting moms &quot;You know <br/>\ndear you should..&quot;LOL.  Geez, if I knew then what I THINK I know <br/>\nnow.  I guess that&#39;s why parents are such different creatures when <br/>\nthey become grandparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have gotten to this point thanks for &quot;listening&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24333,"nextTopicId":24390}}
