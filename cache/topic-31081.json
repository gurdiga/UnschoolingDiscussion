A","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-972500009\">Members of the Canadian Homeschooling list were discussing ways of helping <br/>\nAfghani women and children last fall and decided to make a quilt to <br/>\nraffle.  A number of our members made squares (including moi) and last <br/>\nweekend a bunch of us got together and quilted it.  Along the way, we&#39;ve <br/>\npicked up several more prizes (with more possible).  We now have a <br/>\nbeautiful pieced, embroidered wall-hanging, a pillow (made from a square <br/>\nthat didn&#39;t arrive in time), and a necklace, along with the quilt.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested in this project, go to <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.quilt4afghanistan.i8.com\">http://www.quilt4afghanistan.i8.com</a><br/>\nYou can see a picture of the whole quilt as well as the individual squares, <br/>\nthe wall-hanging, the pillow, and the necklace.  If you want to buy a <br/>\nticket, you can print them out from the web page.  The address to send <br/>\nmoney to is also there.  Be aware that we&#39;ve changed the draw date to <br/>\nFebruary 28.  If you have more questions, write me privately as I&#39;m having <br/>\ntrouble keeping up with my lists lately.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\nEleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31074,"nextTopicId":31093}}
