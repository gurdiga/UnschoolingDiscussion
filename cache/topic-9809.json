An Angel appeared and said, &quot;Why are you spending so much<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;time on this one?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;And the Lord answered and said, &quot;Have you seen the spec sheet on her?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;She has to be completely washable, but not plastic, have 200 movable<br/>\n&gt;parts,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;all replaceable, run on black coffee and leftovers, have a lap that can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;hold three children at one time and that disappears when she stands up,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;have a kiss that can cure anything from a scraped knee to a broken<br/>\n </span></blockquote>heart,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;have six pairs of hands.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The Angel was astounded at the requirements for this one. &quot;Six pairs<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;of hands!  No Way!&quot; said the Angel.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The Lord replied, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s not the hands that are the problem. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;the three pairs of eyes that mothers must have!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;And that&#39;s just on the standard model?&quot;, the Angel asked.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The Lord nodded in agreement, &quot;Yep, one pair of eyes are to see<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;through the closed door as she asks her children what they are doing<br/>\n </span></blockquote>even<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;though<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;she already knows.  Another pair in the back of her head, are to see<br/>\n </span></blockquote>what<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;she needs to know even though no one thinks she can. And the third pair<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;are here in the front of her head.  They are for looking at an errant<br/>\n&gt;child<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;and saying that she understands and loves him or her without even saying<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;single word.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The Angel tried to stop the Lord. &quot;This is too much work for one day.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Wait until tomorrow to finish.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;But I can&#39;t!&quot; The Lord protested, &quot;I am so close to finishing this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;creation that is so close to my own heart.  She already heals herself<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;when she is sick AND can feed a family of six on a pound of hamburger<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;she can get a nine year old to stand in the shower.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The Angel moved closer and touched the woman, &quot;But you have made her<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;so soft, Lord.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;She is soft,&quot; the Lord agreed, &quot;but I have also made her tough. You<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;have no idea what she can endure or accomplish.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;Will she be able to think?&quot;, asked the Angel.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The Lord replied, &quot;Not only will she be able to think, she will be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;able to reason, and negotiate.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The Angel then noticed something and reached out and touched the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;woman&#39;s cheek. &quot;Oops, it looks like you have a leak with this model.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;told<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;you that you were trying to put too much into this one.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s not a leak.&quot; The Lord objected. &quot;That&#39;s a tear!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s the tear for?&quot; the Angel asked.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The Lord said, &quot;The tear is her way of expressing her joy, her<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;sorrow, her disappointment, her pain, her loneliness, her grief, and her<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;pride.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The Angel was impressed. &quot;You are a genius, Lord. You thought of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;everything; for WOMEN are truly amazing!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Pass this to all-amazing women that you know<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9721,"nextTopicId":9812}}
