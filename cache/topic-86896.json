I had her pay the fine because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s nice to &quot;borrow&quot; something and never return it.. I say borrow- because when her brothers give her things, they do want it back.......... SOMETIME....... I guess it just irritates me because we&#39;ll buy toys and they just don&#39;t seem like they&#39;re getting played with.. to shove them in the closet in the box to be forgotten. Pretty lame of me, I guess..<br/>\n Anyways, I&#39;ve dropped it with them. I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;ll just treat it like most other disagreements they have--- When they come to me, telling me so and so did this or that to them... I say well, go tell that person how you feel! Tell him/her that, that hurt you or you didn&#39;t like that.. ect. That usually works good. Another thing, when they fight, sometimes I have them hold hands until THEY can work it out. I DO want them to know how to figure things out on their own, ya know? I&#39;m not trying to be lazy- I just think that that is a good skill to have. To be able to work out the wrong in a relationship- and to tell others how you feel, instead of telling everyone EXCEPT that person who caused those feelings. I don&#39;t want them to feel like they have to hold things in. As long as they say how they feel in a decent way- there&#39;s ways of telling someone they hurt you w/o hurting them back. It always ends up with them laughing and then they go off and play! :)<br/>\n <br/>\n~Pam<br/>\n<br/>\nWife2Vegman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wifetovegman2002@...\">wifetovegman2002@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n--- writeemee wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmmm....

It&#39;s hard to be the <br/>\nyoungest, <br/>\nmaybe she perceives they have all the good toys.
