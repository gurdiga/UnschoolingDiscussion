THE DECLARATION OF EDUCATIONAL INDEPENDENCE WHEN in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for Families to dissolve the ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1915014237\">Happy holiday...<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n-----------------------------------------<br/>\nTHE DECLARATION OF EDUCATIONAL INDEPENDENCE<br/>\n<br/>\nWHEN in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for Families to<br/>\ndissolve the<br/>\n         Educational Bands which have connected them to a faltering Society,<br/>\nand to assume among the<br/>\n         Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal Station to which the Laws<br/>\nof Nature and of Nature&#39;s God<br/>\n         entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires<br/>\nthat they should declare the causes<br/>\n         which impel them to the Separation.<br/>\n<br/>\n         WE hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created<br/>\nequal, that they are endowed by their<br/>\n         Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,<br/>\nLiberty, and the Pursuit of<br/>\n         Happiness?That to secure these Rights, Education is instituted among<br/>\nMen, deriving its just Powers<br/>\n         from the Consent of the Educated, that whenever any Form of Education<br/>\nbecomes destructive of these<br/>\n         Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to<br/>\ninstitute new Education, laying its<br/>\n         Foundation on such Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form,<br/>\nas to them shall seem most<br/>\n         likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will<br/>\ndictate that a Public Education<br/>\n         System long established should not be changed for light and transient<br/>\nCauses; and accordingly all<br/>\n         Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to suffer, while<br/>\nEvils are sufferable, than to<br/>\n         right themselves by Abolishing the Public Education System to which<br/>\nthey are accustomed. But when<br/>\n         a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same<br/>\nObject, evinces a Design to<br/>\n         reduce them under absolute Government Control, it is their Right, it<br/>\nis their Duty, to throw off such<br/>\n         Public Education System, and to provide new Guards for their future<br/>\nSecurity. Such has been the<br/>\n         patient Sufferance of these Families; and such is now the Necessity<br/>\nwhich constrains them to alter<br/>\n         their former Educational System. The History of the<br/>\nGovernment-Controlled, Public Education<br/>\n         System is a History of repeated Injuries and<br/>\n<br/>\n         Usurpations, all having in direct Object the Establishment of an<br/>\nabsolute Control over these Families.<br/>\n         To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid World.<br/>\n<br/>\n         THE GOVERNMENT has refused its Assent to Freedom in Education, the<br/>\nmost wholesome and<br/>\n         necessary for the public Good.<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT has forbidden its Children Freedom of immediate and pressing<br/>\nImportance...<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT has refused Freedom for the Accommodation of large Numbers of<br/>\nFamilies, unless those Families<br/>\n         would register with the State, a violation of freedom and privacy to<br/>\nthem, and formidable to Absolute<br/>\n         Control only.<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT has called together the Nation&#39;s Children at Places unusual,<br/>\nuncomfortable, and distant from the<br/>\n         warmth and nurturance of their Parents, for the sole Purpose of<br/>\nfatiguing them into Compliance with<br/>\n         its Measures.<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT has dissolved Alternatives repeatedly with its unceasing<br/>\nbureaucratic requirements, for opposing<br/>\n         with manly Firmness its Invasions on the Rights of the People.<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT has refused for a long Time, after such dissolutions, to cause<br/>\nother Alternatives to be carried out;<br/>\n         whereby the Educational Powers, incapable of Improvement, have<br/>\nreturned to the failing System at<br/>\n         large for their exercise; the Family remaining in the mean time<br/>\nexposed to all the Dangers of Invasion<br/>\n         from without, and Convulsions within.<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT has endeavored to prevent the True Education of the Population of<br/>\nthese States; for that Purpose<br/>\n         obstructing the Natural Process of Learning; refusing to pass others<br/>\nto encourage their Individual<br/>\n         Efforts...<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT has obstructed the Administration of True Education, by refusing to<br/>\nrecognize the Sovereignty of<br/>\n         Family.<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT has made Public School Employees dependent on its Will alone, for<br/>\nthe Tenure of their Offices,<br/>\n         and the Amount and Payment of their Salaries.<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT has erected a Multitude of new Laws, and sent hither Swarms of Its<br/>\nEmployees to harass our<br/>\n         People, and eat out their Substance.<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT has kept among us, often against the People&#39;s Will, Standing Armies<br/>\nof Social Workers.<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT has affected to render the Education Establishment independent of<br/>\nand superior to the Civil Power.<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT has...subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and<br/>\nunacknowledged by our Laws;<br/>\n         giving its Assent to...Acts of...Legislation:<br/>\n<br/>\n         FOR quartering large Bodies of Compelling Troops among us:<br/>\n<br/>\n         FOR protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any<br/>\nusurpation of Family Sovereignty<br/>\n         which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:<br/>\n<br/>\n         FOR cutting off our Connection with True Education:<br/>\n<br/>\n         FOR imposing Taxes on us used to Oppress us:<br/>\n<br/>\n         FOR depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of Family Time;<br/>\n<br/>\n         FOR transporting our Children for large blocks of their time;<br/>\n<br/>\n         FOR taking away our Family Autonomy, abolishing our most valuable<br/>\nFamily Connections, and<br/>\n         altering fundamentally the Forms of our Families:<br/>\n<br/>\n         FOR suspending our Parental Authority, and declaring itself invested<br/>\nwith Power to control for us in<br/>\n         all cases whatsoever.<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT has abdicated Control here, by failing us its Protection and waging<br/>\nEducational War against us.<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT has plundered our Pocketbooks, ravaged our Family Lives, burnt our<br/>\nTrust, and destroyed the<br/>\n         Lives of our People.<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT is, at this time, forging new Laws to compleat the Works of<br/>\nDespair, Desolation, and Tyranny,<br/>\n         already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and Perfidy, scarcely<br/>\nparalleled in the most barbarous<br/>\n         Ages, and totally unworthy the Government School System of a civilized<br/>\nNation.<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive in our Nation&#39;s<br/>\nClassrooms, to become the<br/>\n         Competitors of their Friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by<br/>\ntheir Hands.<br/>\n<br/>\n         IT has excited domestic Insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored<br/>\nto bring on the Inhabitants of<br/>\n         our Nation, the merciless Conditioning, whose known Rule of Warfare,<br/>\nis an undistinguished<br/>\n         Destruction, of all Ages, Sexes and Conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\n         IN every stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned for Redress in<br/>\nthe most humble Terms: Our<br/>\n         repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated Injury. A<br/>\nPublic Education System, whose<br/>\n         Character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is<br/>\nunfit to be the Educational<br/>\n         Controller of a free People.<br/>\n<br/>\n         NOR have we been wanting in Attentions to our Legislators. We have<br/>\nwarned them from time to time<br/>\n         of Attempts by their very Government to extend an unwarrantable<br/>\nEducational Jurisdiction over us.<br/>\n         We have reminded them of the Circumstances that brought us to this<br/>\npoint. We have appealed to their<br/>\n         native Justice and Magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the Ties<br/>\nof our common Kindred to<br/>\n         disavow these Usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our<br/>\nConnections and Correspondence.<br/>\n         They too have been deaf to the Voice of Justice and of Consanguinity.<br/>\nWe must, therefore, acquiesce<br/>\n         in the Necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we<br/>\nhold the rest of Mankind,<br/>\n         Enemies in War, in Peace, Friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n         WE, therefore, the Families of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in<br/>\nGENERAL AGREEMENT,<br/>\n         Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the<br/>\nRectitude of our Intentions, do, in<br/>\n         the Name, and by Authority of Sound, Sane Parental Consciousness,<br/>\nsolemnly Publish and Declare,<br/>\n         That these United People are, and of Right ought to be, FREE AND<br/>\nINDEPENDENT FAMILIES,<br/>\n         they have full Power to levy Choice in Family Education, consider the<br/>\nFamily&#39;s Values and Time<br/>\n         Needs to choose the extent of participation in and support of the<br/>\nPublic Education System, contract<br/>\n         Alliances, establish Family Priorities and Values, and to do all other<br/>\nActs and Things which<br/>\n         INDEPENDENT FAMILIES may of right do. And for the support of this<br/>\nDeclaration, with a firm<br/>\n         Reliance on the Protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to<br/>\neach other our Lives, our<br/>\n         Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10335,"nextTopicId":10361}}
