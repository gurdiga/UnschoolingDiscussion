I&#39;d  scoop up the  <br/>\nbaby <br/>\nand distract him for a little while, then, when no  one was using the TV,  <br/>\nI&#39;d <br/>\ntake him in there and let him press the  button as many times as he  wished.  <br/>\nI <br/>\nmight ask my 3 yo to ask  me to come get the baby instead of  holding his <br/>\nhand <br/>\nover the button,  though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the baby was so intent on pressing that button that he  screamed and  <br/>\ncried <br/>\nwhen I scooped him up, I&#39;d find him another TV or  other button to push  that <br/>\nhad similar  excitement.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren&gt;&gt;<br/>\n********************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nI typed a response to this but it got deleted when my 5 yr old signed onto  <br/>\nanother program.<br/>\nThe short and skinny of what i wrote was...<br/>\nI don&#39;t *expect my 3 yo to understand, he does understand. The tv clicking  <br/>\nwas a game he and the 16 mo have played for a couple weeks. Cameron (16 mo)  is <br/>\ngetting that Nicholas isn&#39;t laughing as much and he is getting that it isn&#39;t  <br/>\nas much fun..<br/>\n <br/>\nBeing that Cameron is #4 and that this is a growth step the last three  took, <br/>\nI know it will pass. Scooping him up (in this situation) would IMO be  <br/>\nputting more focus on the situation then need be. Nor would it be something  Cameron <br/>\nunderstood why mommy dealt with it in such a way. So i wouldn&#39;t  scoop in <br/>\nthis situation I would however distract and get in between the tv and  Cameron. <br/>\nCameron and Nicholas both know it was a game they  enjoyed and Cameron gets <br/>\nthat Nicholas isn&#39;t laughing so the situation has  dropped down to yesterday <br/>\nbeing a 30 second situation. So far this am it hasn&#39;t  been an issue. Had I <br/>\nscooped him yesterday it would be something he would be  doing today while grinning <br/>\nat me. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy (deleted) post contained more info regarding Cameron and walking which  is <br/>\npart of the family enjoyment of him growing because so many others expressed  <br/>\nconcern over him not walking since 1 yr- 15 mo. So to sum it all up between  <br/>\nNicholas and Cams tv game and Cameron&#39;s proud walk to the tv it&#39;s all  <br/>\ngood..really  <br/>\n <br/>\nI think consistently being a parent to 4 children each needs to grow,  <br/>\nexplore (I don&#39;t mean hurt each other)and realize that each one will go  through <br/>\ntheir stages. Not all react to situations the same. Therefor a  parent needs to <br/>\nknow the child enough to know the motive. For this  situation there was no ill <br/>\nintent simply two brothers learning about each others  personal boundaries. <br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107900,"nextTopicId":107947}}
