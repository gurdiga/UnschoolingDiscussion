I also live in Washington State, in Des Moines.  I<br/>\n&gt; found a fun group in Maple Valley.  They are not strictly<br/>\n&gt; unschooling, but definately unschool friendly.  What part of<br/>\n&gt; Washington are you in?  I have two children, boy 9 and girl 7.  We<br/>\n&gt; are also spiritual agnostics and the first group of homeschoolers we<br/>\n&gt; met were fundamental Christians.  I joined a Yahoo message board<br/>\n&gt; called Washingtonunschoolers and met some nice people there.  That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; how I heard about the Maple Valley group.  I look forward to talking<br/>\n&gt; to you some more.  Us unschoolers in Washington State need to plan a<br/>\n&gt; statewide event where we can get together:)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tammy<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Debbie, Tammy, et al:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are in Puyallup. Let&#39;s correspond privately and see what we can put<br/>\ntogether. Maybe we can even grow into our own &quot;conference/convention.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are talking about the WHO convention, I can share some of the thought<br/>\nprocess that went into selecting the workshops. As a side note, though,<br/>\nattendence (at the paid convention) was down by quite a bit this year. This<br/>\nwas also the case at another conference I attended recently as a vendor. My<br/>\nopinion: the great homeschooler roundup is underway, with alt ed/cover<br/>\nschools picking the independents off one by one. People are falling for the<br/>\nfinancial bribes and &quot;ease of use&quot; arguments.<br/>\n<br/>\nRicka Gerstmann</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38404,"nextTopicId":38407}}
