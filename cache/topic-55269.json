You are still the parent (kids need parents), but your approach to parenting is non coercive, non controlling. Kids can most certainly know the difference between *care* and  *control*. It is your approach that makes it clear to them whether you&#39;re trying to control or that you care for them (health, safety, hygiene, etc.). They love to b loved, but tey will resist control at all cost, and I think that is a natural and healthy response.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to talk to them, explain whys and hows, and keep the communication lines open at all times, as opposed to forcing them into what you think *should* be done. And accept that sometimes getting *no* from them is also ok. Negotiation and compromise are good skills for everyone involved...  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Lotus Therapeutics -<br/>\nAyurveda, Homeopathy, Yoga & Therapeutic Massage<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com\">http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDhyanyoga Center of NC -<br/>\nMeditation - Kundalini Maha Yoga<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dyc-nc.org\">http://www.dyc-nc.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************<br/>\nWhen nothing is done, nothing is left undone.
