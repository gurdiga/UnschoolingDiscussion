In theory, he totally agrees with it. I can understand though that he&#39;s still in the &quot;schooling&quot; mode of academics. He says that he wants more academics done (academics being traditional school type work) but then says he trusts me to keep things going so that she isn&#39;t &quot;behind&quot; or anything and that he knows I have it all under control. <br/>\n <br/>\nI think it could very well be that Sarah is needing more attention. She normally wakes up before anyone else in the morning. I asked her to start coming into my room to snuggle with me more in the mornings rather than heading straight to the living room for some televsion (she actually prefers educational shows like Between the Lions and Magic Schoolbus!). <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m going to take her out for icecream wednesday night, just us. Start looking to do that more. I used to take her twice a month on payday to a little icecream shop that overlooked King&#39;s Bay (Crystal River) but we lived in Florida and it was easier then! But I figured I can at least take her to a local Friendly&#39;s for a sundae even if it doesn&#39;t have half the view that little icecream shop had had! <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, thanks for the reminder to give her more attention. I do think that&#39;s more of what she is needing than academics - everytime we do anything schoolish it works for a couple of days and then we end up in fights about it. Particularly if it involves handwriting. I don&#39;t mean practicing, my mean writing by hand.  <br/>\n <br/>\nElizabeth in MA<br/>\n<br/>\nv_malott &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vmalott@...\">vmalott@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Elizabeth Roberts <br/>\n&lt;mamabethuscg@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ANYWAY I think I&#39;m rambling...things are not really going good here <br/>\n&gt; unschooling wise in that my husband wants us to return to more <br/>\n&gt; structured academics and actually so does Sarah. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with what others have said here regarding DH.

Thanks in advance.<br/>\nSandra, the crazed collector&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis thread is giving me an opening for some thoughts that I have been<br/>\nhaving since the conference. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI was sorry that the Rules vs Principles presentation was so short - it<br/>\nseemed like we only scratched the surface of this idea. It was one that I<br/>\nhad trouble coming to grips with. Not having rules is the easy part.<br/>\nArticulating principles seemed really difficult. I kept believing that I<br/>\nneeded to do in life, what we were doing as an exercise at the conference -<br/>\ntranslate every rule into the jargon of principles. I fear the exercise at<br/>\nthe conference may have led new or considering unschoolers to feel just as<br/>\nSandra&#39;s friend does - &quot;it&#39;s just rules expressed more gently&quot;. I know<br/>\nthere&#39;s a difference, but we didn&#39;t seem to have enough time to really get<br/>\ninto it that day. I hope we hear more from Ben at the next one.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI mentioned to Ben after the presentation that one idea about the difference<br/>\nwas that Rules often seem to be aimed at the children, whereas Principles<br/>\nwere for the benefit of the entire family.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the language of Recovery, Spiritual Principles are single words, the<br/>\nopposite of character defects. Words like Honesty, Generosity, Courtesy,<br/>\nCompassion and Kindness. Keeping children safe might be part of the<br/>\nprinciple of Security or Confidence. Once I was reminded of the single words<br/>\nconcept, it became much easier to grasp principles instead of rules. I<br/>\nstopped thinking of them as needing to be grand mission statements defining<br/>\nthe family&#39;s sweeping purpose (image of Scarlett O&#39;Hara holding her muddy<br/>\nfist to the sky - &quot;As God is my witness...&quot;) and stopped feeling like I was<br/>\njust missing the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn dealing with Jayn, I try to give her reasonable and likely scenarios in<br/>\nthe form of &quot;If you do x, y or z may happen&quot;. She often replies with &quot;I&#39;m<br/>\ngoing to do it anyway&quot;. If it is a question of safety, I try to refrain from<br/>\nthe almost useless and sure to lead to a fall, &quot;Be careful&quot;, and say<br/>\nsomething specific like &quot;I&#39;m worried that .&quot; or &quot;That has a really pointy<br/>\nend&quot;. Sometimes my struggle is to avoid merely &quot;because I don&#39;t like it&quot; as<br/>\nthe reason she should desist. I have to examine why I want it to stop - am I<br/>\ntired, pre-mentrual, excessively worried about the opinion of some neighbor,<br/>\nmomentarily locked in a childhood moment revisited? One of my fears is that,<br/>\nin the absence of punishment (she has never been punished), she will see my<br/>\ndisapproval as the punishment. Still a work in progress. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes if I am bugged I leave the room. For example: Jayn loves to pour<br/>\nwater out of the tub onto the floor of the bathroom or throw it around. This<br/>\nleaves a mess that is both a pain to clean up, and dangerously slippery, but<br/>\nI think it bugs me for some other subconscious reason that I haven&#39;t been<br/>\nable to unearth. Jayn often won&#39;t stop when I ask her to, and it seems<br/>\npunitive to pull her out of the tub as I have done in the past. If I made a<br/>\n&quot;no pouring&quot; rule, almost every bath would turn into a war. Instead I<br/>\nsurrendered to her desire to experiment with water. I&#39;m so much happier. I<br/>\nput down some extra towels as bathmats - this takes care of the principle of<br/>\na safe environment (Comfort and Security); I move the magazines etc out of<br/>\nharm&#39;s way - this takes care of the principle of caring for other people&#39;s<br/>\nthings (Consideration); and I wait within earshot, in the next room - this<br/>\ntakes care of the principle of self care (can&#39;t think of &quot;single word&quot; right<br/>\nnow). The bonus reward is listening to her enjoy the fantasy play with her<br/>\ndolls, cups, fish, other toys and kitchen utensils. Sometimes she says she<br/>\nis lonely and wants me in there. She gets to choose not to splash me where I<br/>\nam sitting if she wants me in the room with her. I remind her she can throw<br/>\nthe water at the wall by the tub instead. Of course I could also purchase a<br/>\nshower curtain for the tub, which could move the play in a whole new<br/>\ndirection.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI know I have more on RvsP - the story of last week at Dance class, and<br/>\nJames&#39; one rule with Jayn.

We have asked him to please turn off the lights before he goes to sleep.  But it&#39;s not a &quot;rule&quot;.  If the rule was to be allowed to stay up late, you must turn off all the lights before you go to sleep, we&#39;d be having regular conflicts about it.  But having the principle of not wasting money, allows us to work towards it together, not against each other.  Since I first mentioned it to him he&#39;s been pretty good about it .. I&#39;d say 70% of the time I get up in the morning the lights are off.  When they are left on, I understand that he probably got really tired, or was distracted by something he was doing and forgot.  I know he&#39;s not leaving them on just to piss me off.  I&#39;ll usually mention sometime the next day that I noticed a lot of lights on when I got up and could please try and remember to turn them off.  That&#39;s it - no hassle, no shame.  Last night around 1:30am when I woke up and wandered back to my bed from my daughter&#39;s I noticed that many lights were on (we have an open staircase) and I gently called to him.  He was in the TV room and came immediately.  I asked if he could please do the rounds and turn off the lights in the rooms he wasn&#39;t in, and he did right away without a word or a huff and went back to what he was doing.  Just living together in peace.  It made me smile while I went back to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still think regularly about a conversation I had with my mother a few months ago ... I think it was her first real glimpse that we were doing something quite different.  I was telling her how we discuss and explain things with the kids (principles), and she said that there must be something they have to do just because I say so (rules).  I said no, if there was something I would like the kids to do, I ask them and explain why .. there is always a reason for something, so just tell them.  If they choose not to do it, I know they have considered what I said and they usually let me know their reasons (and they are usually quite understandable from their POV).  She tried a couple of examples, and I explained what I&#39;d say to the kids, then in a bit of frustration she gave up and said she couldn&#39;t think of anything right then.  And she hasn&#39;t brought it up since.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for completeness (I don&#39;t think we got this far in our conversation), if there&#39;s no real choice for the kids (like having to get someone somewhere), I explain that too and let them know I understand that they really don&#39;t want to go, but that I appreciate them doing it anyway.  And I try to show it by doing something extra of their choice, either while we&#39;re out or later when we get home.  This almost always works out without great anger or tantrums, because they trust me and know that I have always tried my best to minimize the times they would have to do something they don&#39;t like just because there is no other choice.  That&#39;s the principle I have of trying to live life without having a negative impact on the people around me, not the rule of if I say you have do something, you do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concept of rules vs. principles has really helped me shift my thinking.  It&#39;s given me a good place to start when thinking situations through.  Whenever I think that there is something I want my kids (or my husband for that matter)  to do, I ask myself why?  And when I get to the root of why, I can either explain it well to them, or come to the realization that it really has nothing to do with them, just some holdover of schoolish expectations, and I can let it go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPam L.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164396504,"authorName":"Elizabeth Roberts","from":"Elizabeth Roberts &lt;mamabethuscg@...&gt;","profile":"mamabethuscg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"general thoughts re: parenting","postDate":"1069617216","msgId":85231,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMxMTIzMTk1MzM2Ljc3MDE3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjEyNjAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMGYwMWMzYjFkZiQyMmQzNDNjMCQ2N2U5NDcxOEBjYS5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":85227,"nextInTopic":85242,"prevInTime":85230,"nextInTime":85232,"topicId":85192,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, for what it s worth...I ve been following these threads lately about chores, rules, responsibilities, spanking ( training ) vs. not spanking, etc. What","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1090647674\">Well, for what it&#39;s worth...I&#39;ve been following these threads lately about chores, rules, responsibilities, spanking (&quot;training&quot;) vs. not spanking, etc. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat it made me realize is that while we rarely if ever spank..I do yell entirely way too much at the children. A large part of this has been because I suffer from a chronic depression that is made worse due to being post-partum. I was supposed to be on Paxil again immediately after delivering Gracie but suffered superficial blood clots, a pulmonary embolism and then I developed a DVT. I&#39;m on Coumadin for another three months because of it, and coumadin interacts with just about everything.<br/>\n <br/>\nHowever, these discussions did help me to realize that in order to better effectively parent my children I needed to be back on the Paxil if at all possible with the coumadin. Yelling and screaming all the time..seeing my children&#39;s faces as they didn&#39;t understand why I was being so mean...and a couple of times my older child (the one who has been spanked most in her life, albeit not for quite awhile) even literally cowering crouched with her hands in the air to protect herself thinking that I was about to hit her...YIKES! That got to me...and I could hear the echos of these conversations, my own inner sense of right and wrong and ultimately knowing that Jesus Christ would not be yelling at these children like I was. <br/>\n <br/>\nSO I bit back pride and everything else and we&#39;ve had a pretty wonderful week with me back on the medications. It&#39;s easier now to keep to not spanking, and while like I said we keep that option open..we really rarely would need to spank...<br/>\n <br/>\nANYWAY I think I&#39;m rambling...things are not really going good here unschooling wise in that my husband wants us to return to more structured academics and actually so does Sarah. I&#39;m going to try to keep it very informal though, just making sure she does some mathematics and writing each day but as dissimilar to school work as I can make it. <br/>\n <br/>\nI could use some help figuring out how to do more academics to keep him happy, but as little as possible to keep us happy. Sarah does like workbooks and she&#39;ll do them in bits and spurts. I have to show a portfolio at the end of the year but I&#39;m not really worried about pulling that together.<br/>\n <br/>\nElizabeth in MA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] rules vs. principles","postDate":"1069607276","msgId":85210,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdmLjNmOTgyNTkxLjJjZjI0MzZjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":85209,"nextInTopic":85227,"prevInTime":85209,"nextInTime":85211,"topicId":85192,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/23/03 9:35:03 AM, tmthomas@shaw.ca writes:  I understand that those would have rules,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1107458977\">In a message dated 11/23/03 9:35:03 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tmthomas@...\">tmthomas@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Jail, military, school - all very rule bound.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that those would have rules, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was teaching I had a rule that I didn&#39;t want writing turned in on <br/>\nnotebook paper torn out of a spiral, with all the fringe on it.  A pile of 130 of <br/>\nthose is a big pile, and I trailed litter (a $300 fine in New Mexico &lt;g&gt;).   <br/>\nIf they used spiral paper, they needed to cut that edge off.  I had scissors <br/>\nfor them to use.  I would give them plain notebook paper too, if they didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave any.   Some of the kids acted like I was ruining their lives saying &quot;cut <br/>\nthat edge off or I don&#39;t want it.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind following rules.  The principle that it&#39;s best to do what others <br/>\nneed you to do in a situation covers that. &lt;g&gt;   I obey most of the laws of <br/>\nwhich I&#39;m aware (though it&#39;s been years since I filed a statement of intent to <br/>\nhomeschool, and Holly reads speed limit signs to me sometimes in a meaningful <br/>\nway).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids don&#39;t mind following rules when they join clubs or attend meetings in <br/>\nplaces with rules.  The anime store where they play (and where Kirby came to <br/>\nwork after a while) has a language rule.  They can say &quot;crap&quot; but nothing else <br/>\nof its sort or worse.  There&#39;s a 25 cent fine.  If they don&#39;t have a quarter <br/>\nthey do pushups.   But because of that rule, families go there that wouldn&#39;t <br/>\ngo if it had the atmosphere of a sleazy bowling alley.  (It has the atmosphere <br/>\nof a geeky gaming store.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one reason they don&#39;t mind following rules is that they haven&#39;t <br/>\nalready &quot;had it up to here&quot; with rules, as kids have who have a whole life of home <br/>\nrules and school rules.  They find rules kind of fascinating and charming, <br/>\nhonestly.   When Holly&#39;s had a dress code for a dance class or acting class she <br/>\nis THRILLED.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe also because they haven&#39;t been forced to take classes or go to gaming <br/>\nshops (?!?) they know they&#39;re there voluntarily and part of the contract is <br/>\nthat they abide by the rules.   No problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably some families make rules so that their kids will learn to follow <br/>\nrules.  It&#39;s possible.  Too much practice can kill the joy, though.  Being forced <br/>\nto play an instrument can create an adult who doesn&#39;t even bother to own one <br/>\nof the instruments he knows how to play, because how he&#39;s out of school he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t &quot;have to.&quot;  If someone made me practice eating before every meal, I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be very hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here I have kids who can sleep as long as they want, who set their alarms <br/>\nand get up; who have all kinds of clothes and no rules, who dress well and <br/>\nappropriately to the situation; who don&#39;t have to come home but they DO come home.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething important is happening.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4324016,"authorName":"Kelly Lenhart","from":"&quot;Kelly Lenhart&quot; &lt;mina@...&gt;","profile":"mommamina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] rules vs. principles","postDate":"1069607007","msgId":85209,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA1YjAwMWMzYjFlMyRjZGM1N2JmMCQwNTAwMDAwYUBtYWJiLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDE2Mi4yOGI3NWZmNS4yY2YyMzlhMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":85206,"nextInTopic":85210,"prevInTime":85208,"nextInTime":85210,"topicId":85192,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/23/03 8:50:14 AM, mina@mabb.net writes:  ...

Hence, (there&#39;s a PhD word&lt;g&gt;) if rules, I don&#39;t have to think for myself.  Like in a school setting - bells rings, stand up, move, sit down, write this, look here, look there.  Jail, military, school - all very rule bound.  And from what I&#39;ve seen the bastion of free-thought and academic freedom is actually very rule-bound - Universities, with their flavour of &quot;teachers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPrinciples, on other hand, are guides to respectful living, freedom, and openness. We can value completely different interpretations of the principles.  In his book on how to a volunteer board that works, John Carver (ironically also a PhD) points out that setting guidelines allows &quot;any reasonable interpretation&quot; of a broad guideline, rather than tying the organization up in knots with rule books.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best **theoretical** example I&#39;ve heard of is the way the US congress governs the Pres.  Broad guidelines, like &quot;commonly accepted practices.&quot;  They don&#39;t tie him tight with a rulebook. Not sure that it really works that way, or works that well as a form of governance, but it may form an example.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs in Sandra&#39;s example, it seems to me that she lives by setting those guidelines, accepts reasonable interpretations, and make suggestions to help the kids (others?) live more fully.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy (morning) thots,<br/>\nTim T<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, November 23, 2003 5:53 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] rules vs. principles<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 11/23/03 5:10:38 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; If they understand the rules and the rules are sensible why are they be<br/>\n  pushing the limits repeatedly?<br/>\n<br/>\n  If they don&#39;t understand the rules then hitting isn&#39;t an explanation.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If the rules don&#39;t make sense then hitting doesn&#39;t make them make sense.<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  That was addressed to someone who talked about rules, but I want to talk <br/>\n  about rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A close longtime friend of mine, Jeff (for those of you who know me or Jeff <br/>\n  &lt;g&gt;), is married to someone who&#39;s stricter than I like, and sometimes stricter <br/>\n  than Jeff likes.  His kids are younger than mine.  We talk.  I told Jeff kids <br/>\n  can&#39;t break rules when there are principles instead of rules, and he said we <br/>\n  MUST have rules, we just like to call them principles.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I said no, they weren&#39;t rules, but we had regular practices which are just <br/>\n  accepted, like if I wake up and a kid is gone, there&#39;s e-mail or a note.  If <br/>\n  someone takes the kitchen trash out, they replace the bag.  He said then those <br/>\n  are rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think they are.  I&#39;d love to discuss that here.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ben Lovejoy, Kelly&#39;s husband, did a workshop on principles at the conference <br/>\n  in August.  While Ben was talking, I felt really confident.  It helps lots <br/>\n  that Ben has a military background and he KNOWS rules, and he feels he&#39;s living <br/>\n  with principles.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Jeff is from an academic background (both parents college prof-types though <br/>\n  he himself became an engineer, though he could have a PhD in history without <br/>\n  even breathing hard, probably just with stuff he has around the house &lt;g&gt;), and <br/>\n  could easily be already on the trail to few rules in life.   He&#39;s not, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And as to my two non-rules, yesterday I threw something (a paper towel) in <br/>\n  the trashere was no bag in the trash can.   She looked in, and there were TWO <br/>\n  pieces of trash.  I got a bag, she got the trash out, Keith (who was in the <br/>\n  room) said &quot;Oh, I guess I didn&#39;t replace the bag; sorry.&quot;  Holly held the trash <br/>\n  while I got the bag in, put the trash back in, and nobody was &quot;in trouble.&quot;  It <br/>\n  was no big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I got up early this morning and went to gaze upon the children in their beds <br/>\n  (or at least to get some juice out of the fridge, and on the way...   <br/>\n<br/>\n  I usually gaze upon Holly and Kirby&#39;s closed doors, but Kirby&#39;s door was <br/>\n  open.  He never sleeps with his door open.  And a little light was flashing.  So I <br/>\n  turned the hall light on and peeked in.  No extra futons on the floor.  Dog <br/>\n  on the bed (typical) and one human form.  Cell phone on the floor.  Kirby <br/>\n  doesn&#39;t have a cell phone.  Shape smaller than Kirby.  Looks like his friend Eric.  <br/>\n  I turned the light off.   <br/>\n<br/>\n  The door to the library (big garage-sized room, not coincidentally over the <br/>\n  garage) was pulled shut (sliding door) but the light was on.  I listened; <br/>\n  quiet.  I turned the light off, nobody objected.  I thought maybe Kirby wasn&#39;t <br/>\n  home.  He worked until 1:00 a.m. and had my van.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  The van&#39;s outside.  Their friend Brett&#39;s truck (or someone&#39;s truck) is <br/>\n  outside.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I figure some fell asleep with the light on, in the library.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I could go up there and see if Kirby&#39;s home, but when I was Kirby&#39;s age I was <br/>\n  in college and sometimes NOT home.  Kirby is way calmer, less involved with <br/>\n  the opposite sex, and less needy of being gone than I was at his age.  If he&#39;s <br/>\n  not up there, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s somewhere reasonable and safe.  If he IS up there, <br/>\n  why wake him and at least one other teen up at 6:00 a.m.?<br/>\n<br/>\n  That&#39;s what I thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One more story before I leave this for others to analyze or expand upon:  the <br/>\n  dog&#39;s water dish is in the kitchen, and for the third time in a week, it was <br/>\n  not so clean and not so full (dry or nearly dry with dissolving dry dog food <br/>\n  in it).   I picked it up to rinse and fill it, and Marty (14, and the dog owner <br/>\n  of record) was in the room.  I thought quickly through some options of what <br/>\n  to say.  I have little pulldown menus like the Terminator sometimes.  Not <br/>\n  always, but sometimes.   <br/>\n<br/>\n  This time I think I picked a good one.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I said &quot;Maybe you&#39;re changing the dog&#39;s water every day, but if so you might <br/>\n  want to do it twice a day.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I liked that one.  It was useful, yet subtle.  I wasn&#39;t mean and he didn&#39;t <br/>\n  feel &quot;told.&quot;   I didn&#39;t say &quot;never&quot; and I didn&#39;t say &quot;always,&quot; I just said <br/>\n  &quot;more.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

His kids are younger than mine.  We talk.  I told Jeff kids <br/>\ncan&#39;t break rules when there are principles instead of rules, and he said we <br/>\nMUST have rules, we just like to call them principles.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI said no, they weren&#39;t rules, but we had regular practices which are just <br/>\naccepted, like if I wake up and a kid is gone, there&#39;s e-mail or a note.  If <br/>\nsomeone takes the kitchen trash out, they replace the bag.  He said then those <br/>\nare rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think they are.  I&#39;d love to discuss that here.<br/>\n<br/>\nBen Lovejoy, Kelly&#39;s husband, did a workshop on principles at the conference <br/>\nin August.  While Ben was talking, I felt really confident.  It helps lots <br/>\nthat Ben has a military background and he KNOWS rules, and he feels he&#39;s living <br/>\nwith principles.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJeff is from an academic background (both parents college prof-types though <br/>\nhe himself became an engineer, though he could have a PhD in history without <br/>\neven breathing hard, probably just with stuff he has around the house &lt;g&gt;), and <br/>\ncould easily be already on the trail to few rules in life.   He&#39;s not, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as to my two non-rules, yesterday I threw something (a paper towel) in <br/>\nthe trashere was no bag in the trash can.   She looked in, and there were TWO <br/>\npieces of trash.  I got a bag, she got the trash out, Keith (who was in the <br/>\nroom) said &quot;Oh, I guess I didn&#39;t replace the bag; sorry.&quot;  Holly held the trash <br/>\nwhile I got the bag in, put the trash back in, and nobody was &quot;in trouble.&quot;  It <br/>\nwas no big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got up early this morning and went to gaze upon the children in their beds <br/>\n(or at least to get some juice out of the fridge, and on the way...   <br/>\n<br/>\nI usually gaze upon Holly and Kirby&#39;s closed doors, but Kirby&#39;s door was <br/>\nopen.  He never sleeps with his door open.  And a little light was flashing.  So I <br/>\nturned the hall light on and peeked in.  No extra futons on the floor.  Dog <br/>\non the bed (typical) and one human form.  Cell phone on the floor.  Kirby <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have a cell phone.  Shape smaller than Kirby.  Looks like his friend Eric.  <br/>\nI turned the light off.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe door to the library (big garage-sized room, not coincidentally over the <br/>\ngarage) was pulled shut (sliding door) but the light was on.  I listened; <br/>\nquiet.  I turned the light off, nobody objected.  I thought maybe Kirby wasn&#39;t <br/>\nhome.  He worked until 1:00 a.m. and had my van.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe van&#39;s outside.  Their friend Brett&#39;s truck (or someone&#39;s truck) is <br/>\noutside.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI figure some fell asleep with the light on, in the library.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could go up there and see if Kirby&#39;s home, but when I was Kirby&#39;s age I was <br/>\nin college and sometimes NOT home.  Kirby is way calmer, less involved with <br/>\nthe opposite sex, and less needy of being gone than I was at his age.  If he&#39;s <br/>\nnot up there, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s somewhere reasonable and safe.  If he IS up there, <br/>\nwhy wake him and at least one other teen up at 6:00 a.m.?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more story before I leave this for others to analyze or expand upon:  the <br/>\ndog&#39;s water dish is in the kitchen, and for the third time in a week, it was <br/>\nnot so clean and not so full (dry or nearly dry with dissolving dry dog food <br/>\nin it).   I picked it up to rinse and fill it, and Marty (14, and the dog owner <br/>\nof record) was in the room.  I thought quickly through some options of what <br/>\nto say.  I have little pulldown menus like the Terminator sometimes.  Not <br/>\nalways, but sometimes.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThis time I think I picked a good one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said &quot;Maybe you&#39;re changing the dog&#39;s water every day, but if so you might <br/>\nwant to do it twice a day.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked that one.  It was useful, yet subtle.  I wasn&#39;t mean and he didn&#39;t <br/>\nfeel &quot;told.&quot;   I didn&#39;t say &quot;never&quot; and I didn&#39;t say &quot;always,&quot; I just said <br/>\n&quot;more.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85343,"nextTopicId":85326}}
