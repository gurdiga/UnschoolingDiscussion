The classes only last two weeks, and she picks one that starts at 1:00 in the afternoon since she doesn&#39;t like getting up early.   The public school system does the same type of thing.  It gives her a chance to be part of a herd.  She&#39;s nine now, but still just loves packing her lunch, getting dropped off with a teacher, being part of a herd--all that stuff!  By the way, the first summer we were homeschoolers, she kept going on and on about how she wanted to go to school, but it was summer!  She was too young to understand that, so I offered a summer program at the local private school (one mile from our house).  The class started at 8:30.  She sat glaring at her breakfast on the third day and said, &quot;This is just like school!&quot;   Let me tell you, it was not a compliment!!

Well, I had planned to lurk a bit longer before introducing<br/>\nmyself, but because the schooling issue is the biggest Im struggling<br/>\nwith right now, I thought now would be a good time to jump in!<br/>\nIm Kristi, semi-crunchy unschooling mama to Morgaine, 4 ½, Orion, two<br/>\nnext week, and Isaac, 1 month.  Were in the seacoast of New Hampshire. <br/>\nMorgaine is academically reasonably precocious for her age, which helps<br/>\nmy homeschooling case with family at least (unsupportive mother lives<br/>\nlocally) since she is already reading a bit, writing, adding,<br/>\nsubtracting, etc. and wont be school age this year with her October 20<br/>\nbirthday.  That said, Ive had my mother, other family, and strangers<br/>\nreally pushing the school is  cool mantra with her, plus most of her<br/>\nfriends are in preschool.  She is really angry that she cant go to<br/>\npreschool and public school  doesnt understand the age limitations,<br/>\nreally, since everyone keeps telling her she can go to school this year.<br/>\nAlso even if I *wanted* to send her to preschool, we probably couldnt<br/>\njustify the expense right now anyway, and I certainly wouldnt send her<br/>\nto head start.  <br/>\nSo weve also been having school issues.  There are times she gets<br/>\npretty upset, but shell ask me, if I want to go to public school when<br/>\nIm 16, can I? and that settles things a bit. <br/>\nIm wondering if part of the reason some people (like me) really balk at<br/>\nthe idea of sending kids to school is that we might be a little afraid<br/>\nthey wont want to come back home to stay?  Homeschooling is something I<br/>\nhave felt strongly about for years, which has led me to unschooling; if<br/>\nshe chooses school in my home it is still within the confines of the<br/>\nchoices I have made for her; if she chooses to leave home several hours<br/>\na day it is not, iykwim?  <br/>\nAnyway, thats us, and thanks for all the great discussion to read!<br/>\nThis is the only list I actually receive into my inbox; the rest I am<br/>\nalways nomail, but there are several posts I have already put aside into<br/>\na references folder. <br/>\nKristi <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"echomygecko","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: schooling in an unschooling home.","postDate":"1081538112","msgId":92538,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZiLjI2NzQ2MWI4LjJkYTg1MDQwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":92537,"nextInTopic":92539,"prevInTime":92537,"nextInTime":92539,"topicId":92471,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/9/04 12:47:23 AM Central Daylight Time, queenjane555@yahoo.com writes: The original post said something about a K age and PreK age kids ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2061981836\">In a message dated 4/9/04 12:47:23 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:queenjane555@...\">queenjane555@...</a> writes:<br/>\nThe original post said something about a K age and PreK age kids <br/>\nseeing schoolkids playing on the playground and wanting therefore to <br/>\ngo to school. Sounds to me like they want to play with other kids on <br/>\na playground. THAT is not school. I would hope that they would be <br/>\ngiven more info about what school is(and what it is not)before they <br/>\nwere *signed up.* Others have pointed out that school is not the same <br/>\nexperience if you arent *forced* to be there, and i guess thats true. <br/>\nThe parent just needs to be careful not to get caught up in it and <br/>\nstart requiring homework etc.<br/>\n#########<br/>\nJack wanted to go to school when he was five. All the kids on our block who <br/>\nwere his age were going. They were getting all sorts of cool bookbags, colorful <br/>\ncrayons, new clothes... Against my feelings about school Darin and I signed <br/>\nhim up with the idea that if we were truly allowing our children the freedom to <br/>\nexplore and experience life on their terms we certainly couldn&#39;t hold them <br/>\nback from this either. I don&#39;t know how much information you can impart on a <br/>\nchild that age, about school. Much like getting a pet and expecting a child that <br/>\nage to totally care for it and understand it, you can&#39;t expect a child of five <br/>\nto understand your moral, religious, political, mental reasons about school. <br/>\nNor can you expect a child of five to understand the implications of hours and <br/>\nminutes and lines to stand in and lunch at 11:35 and recess at 1:15 and <br/>\nsitting beside a bully on the bus. So while giving a child of five information on <br/>\nwhat school is and isn&#39;t is all well and good you might as well try and explain <br/>\nthe quantum field theory. And while I am not advocating school, at the age of <br/>\nfive it is really something that has to be experienced to understand. At <br/>\nother ages it would certainly be easier to explain. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe explained all we could about school. Jack still wanted to go. So the day I <br/>\nregistered him I went to Sandra&#39;s site and reread her article about her <br/>\nsister, mustered my courage and explained to his teacher and the principle that <br/>\nwhile I was enrolling Jack, I understood his want to go to school most likely <br/>\nstemmed from wanting to play with his friends, and that I had no expectations <br/>\nother than I wanted Jack to be happy. I explained our educational &quot;philosophy&quot; <br/>\nand that grades and meeting standards meant nothing to me. His teacher, bless <br/>\nher, got it. The principal OTOH, didn&#39;t. No biggie. We made it to the end of the <br/>\nyear unscathed. Though I would have taken Jack home at any point in those 180 <br/>\ndays if he wanted me to do so. The only problem we had was at the end of the <br/>\nyear the principal wanted more than was required by Kansas law for me to take <br/>\nhim out. We worked that out too. I asked Jack if he had plans to go on to <br/>\nfirst grade and here is a quote from my journal on what he said. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In kindergarten we get to sit a tables and color and paint, and we get to <br/>\nplay popcorn bingo on the story carpet, and we have a bathroom in our room if we <br/>\nneed it. In kindergarten we get out of school ten minutes before the big kids <br/>\nand we get to sit at the front in assemblies. In kindergarten we get to <br/>\nlisten to music quietly all day long unless someone else ruins it for us. I like <br/>\nkindergarten.&quot; And I said yes Jack all that is true. Then Jack said; &quot;In first <br/>\ngrade we have to sit at desks right? And Mrs. Latimer wouldn&#39;t be my teacher <br/>\nright? In first grade there isn&#39;t a bathroom in the room and there isn&#39;t a story <br/>\ncarpet either. And in first grade we don&#39;t get to eat lunch until 12:45. I <br/>\neat at 11:30 in kindergarten and I eat when I want at home, I don&#39;t think I want <br/>\nto go to first grade.&quot; And I said but what about your friends Jack? And my <br/>\nwise little man said &quot;I get to play with them more at home than at school anyway <br/>\nMom.&quot; <br/>\n(Exactly what I told him the previous summer, but he had to experience it for <br/>\nhimself to really &quot;know&quot; it.)<br/>\n###########<br/>\n<br/>\nI have another questions though....if my son chose to go to school, <br/>\nit wouldnt just affect him, it would affect me too. I would have to <br/>\nget up earlier, drive him to school, make sure i was there at 3pm to <br/>\npick him up, make sure he was wearing suitable clothing, make sure he <br/>\nwas wearing gym shoes on gym day and took his library books back on <br/>\nthe right day (i could never keep track of these things!)I would have <br/>\nto make sure all his pants had zipper pockets otherwise he&#39;d lose his <br/>\nlunch money (this from experience), i would have to attend parent <br/>\nteacher conferences. All those things are annoying and would really <br/>\ndetract from my life, esp the getting up early part. It would only be <br/>\nworse if i had other kids....our days might have to revolve around <br/>\nthe school schedule. With older kids(teenagers)who could get <br/>\nthemselves to and from school, that might work, but for younger <br/>\nones...it would really negatively impact the family i think. So i <br/>\nwould want to make sure that my child truly understood this, and <br/>\nreally truly wanted to make this choice. If my child&#39;s &quot;need for <br/>\nschool&quot; could be met by getting together to play with other HSers, i <br/>\nwould explore that first, instead signing my child up for school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine<br/>\n<br/>\n#############<br/>\n<br/>\nYep all those things are true, but if a child does decide that school is <br/>\nwhere they want to be those things don&#39;t have to be true or rather they don&#39;t have <br/>\nto be true to the point of making your life miserable.

Even in Kindergarten, many schools are <br/>\n&quot;cracking down&quot; and starting in with academics. You wrote the word <br/>\n&quot;fun&quot; twice in the above paragraph, and i guess i am still confused <br/>\nabout that. Why do your kids think school will be fun? I guess since <br/>\nmy son had some pretty negative experiences (mostly due to two <br/>\nteachers&#39; crappy personalities)in K and 1st grade, we don&#39;t feel like <br/>\n&quot;fun&quot; is the word that best describes school. I suppose i could see <br/>\nhow a never-schooled child might be curious about it. What do they <br/>\nfeel they are going to &quot;get&quot; from going to school? Or is it, for <br/>\nthem, just wanting to try something new?<br/>\n<br/>\nI also agree that it probably won&#39;t do much harm for them to go, as <br/>\nlong as they are free to immediately leave when they want. I would <br/>\nlet the teacher know that too. They might be nicer if they know the <br/>\nkid has a choice. And maybe they would get a really nice teacher whom <br/>\nthey adored.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, now that you&#39;ve explained i understand better, but from your <br/>\nfirst few posts, the impression i got was &quot;my kids want to play, so <br/>\nwhy shouldnt i send them to school, since its so much fun?

My 11 year old wants to go to school for a week or<br/>\ntwo to experience for herself what it is like.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe plans to go at the beginning of next school year (Sep 2004).  She would<br/>\nbe 6th grade based on her birthdate, and that is the first year of middle<br/>\nschool in our area.  It was my idea to try it at the beginning of a school<br/>\nyear, rather than dropping in during the year.  Good idea?  Bad idea?<br/>\n<br/>\nHer previous school experience includes one half year of one day per week<br/>\npreschool at age 3(we moved during the year) and one semester, two years<br/>\nago, of 45 minute art class once a week at the local elementary.  From the<br/>\nart class, she learned that you get only a few minutes to talk with the<br/>\nother kids, you spend a lot of time sitting and waiting for the other kids<br/>\nto quiet down so the teacher can make sure everyone hears what she has to<br/>\nsay, and that you need to do things the teacher&#39;s way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut she still wants to go again to experience what life is like for kids at<br/>\nschool all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am nervous about it.  What if she likes it and wants to continue?  I will<br/>\nfeel that I&#39;ve failed at unschooling if she prefers to be at school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to know how best to support a child doing something that I&#39;d<br/>\nrather she wouldn&#39;t do.

Anything that remotely looks like school, he <br/>\n(mentally)runs screaming in the other direction(figuratively)...while <br/>\ni am glad he wasnt brainwashed into thinking school is the way you <br/>\nlearn, i think that sometimes he is turning his back on some stuff he <br/>\nwould enjoy (like reading and writing and doing puzzlebooks and stuff <br/>\nlike that)because he thinks its &quot;school.&quot; Unschoolers-from-birth <br/>\nmight look at these things as just &quot;more colors in the big palette of <br/>\nlife&quot; but my son sees it as &quot;schoolish&quot;.He rarely picks up or looks <br/>\nat any of the books/magazines/etc we have. While i think much of that <br/>\nis his natural inclination (reading for information not pleasure for <br/>\nexample), and is of course totally ok with me,  it makes me wonder <br/>\nwhat kind of unschooler/&quot;learner&quot; he would have been without having <br/>\nexperienced school at all. I will never know....<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t read the other responses, so i don&#39;t know if this has been <br/>\nsaid, but in your case i would point out that while the playground <br/>\nlooks like fun, the reality is not so fun. And if they want to play <br/>\nwith other kids (which seems to be their reason for wanting to go to <br/>\nschool?)i would suggest attending or starting a playgroup with other <br/>\nhomeschoolers. Playing on that playground with other HSers (esp other <br/>\nunschoolers!)will be a totally different, and IMO better, experience <br/>\nthan going to school to do it. I wouldnt force them to HS next year, <br/>\nof course, but i would do my best to try to meet whatever needs they <br/>\nare expressing, outside of the school environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.

Even here in the States","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1879583164\">I agree it&#39;s not necessarily life threatening, and knowing they have an escape route makes it much better for the individual child.  Even here in the States most schools aren&#39;t too bad.  My school experience for myself and my children was in Australia and from what I know of schools here the ones back Down Under are much better for the inmates.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, schools anywhere are a prison... where else but school do we lock people up and make them do someone else&#39;s bidding with little regard for the individuals freedom to do such basic things as go to the bathroom or have a drink when the needs arise.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEven the most enlightened school, if attendance is compulsory, is a place of torture for some of it&#39;s inmates... why risk it?  Even if your child isn&#39;t one of the tortured, they witness it on a daily basis, human nature being what it is many teachers have favorite and least favorite kids in their class.  The least favored know it, even if the teacher goes out of his/her way to not show his/her feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\n I too have swum in shark infested waters, but I knew the way out, my children have done so too, but I wouldn&#39;t leave them alone there, so I guess the &quot;Shark infested waters&quot; was a bad example.   If your child is one left intact by school, they are lucky,  just watching the degrading treatment of others is a life changing experience... any &quot;grading&quot; of children at all harms the children, either they feel like failures or they feel superior.  Those who go through many years as top of the class, straight A students are often as badly harmed as the dunces, see suicide statistics for college age kids if you don&#39;t believe me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool hurts even the brightest kids, my oldest son was bored to death from first grade on and became very intolerant of people of even normal intelligence, he saw them as holding him back because the class had to progress at their rate not his.  It caused my friendly outgoing preschooler to become a different person.  Children change when they enter school, I always thought it was just something that happens at a certain age, but after sending 6 kids to school, and unschooling three I can tell you the change that happened with my older children was because of school, not a normal developmental thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool is toxic to many children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My youngest child chose to go to school at 5.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;I would not allow my children to play on the freeway, I would not allow my children to swim in shark infested waters and I would not let them go to school before the age of about 15, when hopefully they could cope with the deprivation of liberty and seeing others degraded and humiliated because they aren&#39;t very bright.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I do not think the examples given here are relevant.  I don&#39;t like <br/>\n  school, but here in New Zealand at least, school is not a life <br/>\n  threatening place.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I also think that there is a vast difference in the effect of school on <br/>\n  a child who chooses to go to school compared to the one who is forced to <br/>\n  go to school.  My son chose to go to school knowing he could leave and <br/>\n  be homeschooled when he wanted to - he lasted 5 weeks.  My schooled <br/>\n  niece loved school and was sucessful there. When she had a major <br/>\n  personality conflict with a teacher, my sister told her that if she <br/>\n  wanted to, she could be homeschooled like her cousins.  She chose to <br/>\n  stay at school, because overall she enjoyed it, and the offer of <br/>\n  homeschooling, the knowledge of an escape route, made it bearable.  Once <br/>\n  the offer was made, she changed from being a very unhappy little girl, <br/>\n  to one whose attitude was, &#39;you gotta take to bad with the good&#39;.  But <br/>\n  it was HER attitude, not one my sister told her.  She felt validated, <br/>\n  and knew she had a true choice, so she was okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think school is a good place for human beings, but if the child <br/>\n  is in control of their presence there, I believe the damage is greatly <br/>\n  reduced.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Cally<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n  Yahoo!

My twins (now 8yo) were<br/>\n&gt; curious, secure, and very happy -- until they started school. Their love<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; learning flew out the window when their teachers refused to let them do<br/>\nany<br/>\n&gt; work beyond the class level and punished them (loss of recess) for asking<br/>\n&gt; too many questions. Their self-esteem suffered when teachers belittled<br/>\ntheir<br/>\n&gt; opinions. DS&#39;s self-esteem further suffered when his teacher berated his<br/>\n&gt; sloppy handwriting in front of the entire class and punished him for being<br/>\n&gt; bullied (yes, for BEING bullied, not bullying others). DS&#39;s teacher said<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; had ADHD and insisted he be medicated; we later found out that more than<br/>\n75%<br/>\n&gt; of the boys in that class were on meds. My daughter&#39;s first grade teacher<br/>\n&gt; confiscated books DD brought from home because she felt DD shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt; &quot;allowed&quot; to read beyond grade level. The twins were punished if they<br/>\nplayed<br/>\n&gt; together during recess because the teachers felt it hindered their<br/>\n&gt; socialization with others (even if they were playing in a group of other<br/>\n&gt; children at the time). At the same time, they were constantly compared to<br/>\n&gt; each other and told which one was better/worse at various activities. This<br/>\n&gt; drove a wedge between them and taught them that their twin was competition<br/>\n&gt; rather than a valued friend. The only thing the administration did when I<br/>\n&gt; protested these problems was to label me a pushy, overprotective mother.<br/>\n&gt; Both children became sad, surly, and lost all curiosity. My daughter<br/>\nstopped<br/>\n&gt; reading for pleasure entirely. My son cried whenever he had to do anything<br/>\n&gt; involving a pencil or crayons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, it took us until the middle of second grade (March 2003) to<br/>\n&gt; stop banging our heads against the wall and pull the kids out of school. A<br/>\n&gt; year later, we&#39;re still undoing the damage. My daughter now reads 3-4<br/>\nhours<br/>\n&gt; a day, by her own choosing. My son is starting to journal a bit, mostly<br/>\n&gt; because he&#39;s discovered the fun of scrapbooking with me. But they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; trust themselves to learn anymore, and they turn to me to direct and<br/>\n&gt; dictate. It&#39;s only been the last month or so that they&#39;ve really started<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; ask questions again, to voice opinions, and regain even a bit of the<br/>\n&gt; curiosity they once had. I want to let them discover and explore their<br/>\n&gt; passions, but they&#39;re afraid to become passionate about anything. They&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; rediscovering their bond with each other, but it&#39;s much more tenuous than<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; once was.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not saying your children will have the same experiences mine did, but<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; CAN happen. If I had it to do over, my kids would have never entered a<br/>\n&gt; school building. If yours decide to try school, you&#39;ll want to be extra<br/>\n&gt; alert to changes in personality, motivation, and curiosity.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jenn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

My twins (now 8yo) were<br/>\ncurious, secure, and very happy -- until they started school. Their love of<br/>\nlearning flew out the window when their teachers refused to let them do any<br/>\nwork beyond the class level and punished them (loss of recess) for asking<br/>\ntoo many questions. Their self-esteem suffered when teachers belittled their<br/>\nopinions. DS&#39;s self-esteem further suffered when his teacher berated his<br/>\nsloppy handwriting in front of the entire class and punished him for being<br/>\nbullied (yes, for BEING bullied, not bullying others). DS&#39;s teacher said he<br/>\nhad ADHD and insisted he be medicated; we later found out that more than 75%<br/>\nof the boys in that class were on meds. My daughter&#39;s first grade teacher<br/>\nconfiscated books DD brought from home because she felt DD shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\n&quot;allowed&quot; to read beyond grade level. The twins were punished if they played<br/>\ntogether during recess because the teachers felt it hindered their<br/>\nsocialization with others (even if they were playing in a group of other<br/>\nchildren at the time). At the same time, they were constantly compared to<br/>\neach other and told which one was better/worse at various activities. This<br/>\ndrove a wedge between them and taught them that their twin was competition<br/>\nrather than a valued friend. The only thing the administration did when I<br/>\nprotested these problems was to label me a pushy, overprotective mother.<br/>\nBoth children became sad, surly, and lost all curiosity. My daughter stopped<br/>\nreading for pleasure entirely. My son cried whenever he had to do anything<br/>\ninvolving a pencil or crayons.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, it took us until the middle of second grade (March 2003) to<br/>\nstop banging our heads against the wall and pull the kids out of school. A<br/>\nyear later, we&#39;re still undoing the damage. My daughter now reads 3-4 hours<br/>\na day, by her own choosing. My son is starting to journal a bit, mostly<br/>\nbecause he&#39;s discovered the fun of scrapbooking with me. But they don&#39;t<br/>\ntrust themselves to learn anymore, and they turn to me to direct and<br/>\ndictate. It&#39;s only been the last month or so that they&#39;ve really started to<br/>\nask questions again, to voice opinions, and regain even a bit of the<br/>\ncuriosity they once had. I want to let them discover and explore their<br/>\npassions, but they&#39;re afraid to become passionate about anything. They&#39;re<br/>\nrediscovering their bond with each other, but it&#39;s much more tenuous than it<br/>\nonce was.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying your children will have the same experiences mine did, but it<br/>\nCAN happen. If I had it to do over, my kids would have never entered a<br/>\nschool building. If yours decide to try school, you&#39;ll want to be extra<br/>\nalert to changes in personality, motivation, and curiosity.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.
