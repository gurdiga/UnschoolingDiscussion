I anticipate needing to get an extra fidge/freezer for the garage when they get bigger (and their appeitites do as well.)  For now though, we buy in bulk, freeze a lot of the meats and perishables, cook from scratch (rice, flour, big bag of potatoes, etc)  When we get into the latter part of the second week, we begin to run out of things, and I tell the kids, we are out of that and need to get more, so you have to have something else.  We use the perishables first and then move into the canned and frozen goods as we run out of the other.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do make short runs to the store if we have unexpected company, the milk goes sour, or some such.  But try to limit these as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"NumoAstro@aol.com","from":"NumoAstro@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Ax6sIgyNhEfWuqeHXJ8j-rR5OEqApWq9ou2iQryHgR7ITpPmvGjIFNz5gJHEvQPYPk3PgfiJYBs","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] shopping only twice a month","postDate":"962830596","msgId":10650,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdiLjY1ZWI2M2MuMjY5NGZiMDRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":10649,"nextInTopic":10807,"prevInTime":10649,"nextInTime":10651,"topicId":10649,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/5/2000 1:46:58 PM US Mountain Standard Time, klement@interlynx.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-414892457\">In a message dated 7/5/2000 1:46:58 PM US Mountain Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:klement@...\">klement@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I do have a second fridge and the luxury of 2 chest freezers;<br/>\n one for meats/fish/chicken and the other for fruits vegetables, breads<br/>\n and juice.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m  moving in with you Buzz (LOL)....

I am so amazed!!  I&#39;ve tried to go only once a week<br/>\n&gt; and cannot manage it....we live so far from &quot;town&quot; and the grocery store,<br/>\n&gt; but my refrigerator will simply not hold enough milk or oj for a week and<br/>\n&gt; the bananas get too ripe.  There are NO health food stores or co-ops so<br/>\n&gt; organic is wishful thinking.  How do you do it?!?!?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cindy<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cindy ... do you have a chest freezer ?<br/>\nMilk can be frozen, left out a few hours to thaw (but don&#39;t let it get<br/>\nwarm) and then you shake the bejeezus out of it to mix it well ( it<br/>\nseparates while thawing ) and put into the fridge. It tastes just like<br/>\nyou bought it that day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe in Canada can get our milk in bags as well as the plastic jugs here<br/>\nin. It&#39;s easy to do with the litre bags. I used to freeze sale milk. 1/2<br/>\ngallon plastic jugs are doable too though.<br/>\nBananas can be frozen when they&#39;re at their peak and used for baking,<br/>\nmilkshakes/yogurt shakes etc. My kids will eat frozen bananas like<br/>\npopsicles (ice lollys).I freeze them unpeeled for baking and peeled for<br/>\npopsicle type eating. I just let the unpeeled ones thaw a little and<br/>\nscrape out the banana from the peel. <br/>\nFrozen concentrated orange juice instead of the ready to pour kind takes<br/>\nup less space, as you only bring it from the freezer as you need it.<br/>\nPowdered milk for baking and cooking ... saves space and doesn&#39;t go off.<br/>\nTinned milk works well for pudding and sauces.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too do my grocery shopping once every two weeks even though we live in<br/>\nthe city. I do have a second fridge and the luxury of 2 chest freezers;<br/>\none for meats/fish/chicken and the other for fruits vegetables, breads<br/>\nand juice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuzz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   <br/>\n The Klement Family       &quot;Education is what survives when <br/>\n Darryl, Debbie,           what has been learned has been <br/>\n Kathleen, Nathan &        forgotten&quot;<br/>\n Samantha                  B.F.
