They have a big <br/>\ncloset, jammed full.  Under their bunkbeds: full.  Top of their <br/>\ndresser: full.  Bookshelf: full.  There&#39;s about 30 square feet of <br/>\nplayspace in the middle of the room.  This does include their hand-<br/>\nme-downs, games, diapers, etc as well as their extra sheets; I store <br/>\nthose mostly in high spaces where they can&#39;t reach anyway.  Orion <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have a dresser to save space; I stack a plastic 3-drawer <br/>\nthing ($19 at WalMart) on top of Morgaine&#39;s dresser, but this needs <br/>\nto be rearranged as he is wanting to choose his own clothes now and <br/>\ncan&#39;t reach it.  The rule in the bedroom: I need to be able to walk <br/>\nto the closet without tripping (very important since baby is on my <br/>\nback most of the time), and when the space they have -- say the <br/>\nBarbie bin -- is full, we either need to get rid of some Barbie <br/>\nstuff or get rid of something else to make room for a new bin. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe living room is mostly devoted to smaller kid stuff for now -- I <br/>\nhave two cabinet-style end tables (yard sale, $5/pair) and a little <br/>\ncubby in our entertainment center.  One drawer is for Dan and me, <br/>\nthe rest is for kids&#39; toys that are baby-friendly.  Also all their <br/>\nhotwheels, board books, and rocking toy.  When this space gets full, <br/>\nI purge. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith Morgaine and Orion&#39;s room, it can be hard for them (mostly <br/>\nMorgaine) and I&#39;ll make suggestions, but sh makes the final choice.  <br/>\nOften she prefers to give toys/clothes to friends rather than say <br/>\nthe Salvation Army.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI apply this to the rest of my home too.  If the sewing box gets <br/>\nfull, I sew or purge.  Video shelf, the same.  Etc.  I don&#39;t have a <br/>\nbasement and our shed is packed full.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur home is far from clutter free but it&#39;s not the awful wall-to-<br/>\nwall disaster it once was. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps. <br/>\nKristi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175882957,"authorName":"MomandMe2@aol.com","from":"MomandMe2@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Too many toys?","postDate":"1090274910","msgId":96521,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQyLjExYWMwYmYwLjJlMmRhMDVlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":96408,"nextInTopic":96524,"prevInTime":96520,"nextInTime":96522,"topicId":96408,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/18/04 1:00:06 AM Eastern Daylight Time, heidi@dykema.net ...

Unfortunately, my <br/>\nson attatches sentimental value to EVERYTHING he owns.  He has exteme <br/>\ndifficulties parting with anything, no matter how old or tattered.  What makes it <br/>\nharder, is that because he has such sentimental value with all he owns, he takes <br/>\nVERY good care of it all, which is another reason to him to keep it.  Because <br/>\n&quot;it has nothing wrong with it.&quot;  His room is packed wall to wall, and the <br/>\ncloset floor to ceiling with toys old and new.  I don&#39;t argue with him about <br/>\nkeeping it, but truely, it drives me out of my mind.  I cannot stand clutter, and <br/>\nworse, clutter thats virtually never touched!  He rarely plays with any of it, <br/>\nand much of it, he doesn&#39;t play with at all.  He&#39;s at an age or time in his <br/>\nlife where he&#39;s only interested in a choice few toys anymore.  I&#39;ve suggested the <br/>\ntag sale thing, but he just can&#39;t bring himself to do it.  UGH!!  Is there <br/>\nanyone else out there with this situation with their children?
