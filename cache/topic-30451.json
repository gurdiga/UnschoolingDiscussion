We&#39;ll be around all weekend, I think.<br/>\nMy phone number is 918-396-0108 (it is long distance from B&#39;ville).  I&#39;m<br/>\ntrying to make plans with some (mostly) unschooling friends for a small<br/>\nparty, but not yet sure if we&#39;re going to try to do that New Year&#39;s Eve or<br/>\nnext weekend, but if you&#39;re here then you&#39;re welcome to come to that, too.<br/>\nIt&#39;s just 3 other families...  Either way--give me a call!

They are homeschoolers, too, in fact....and a<br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling friend of mine bought the sibling of the puppy we<br/>\ngot.  There must be some sort of attraction there...  They don&#39;t have any<br/>\nmore pups from this litter, but I think they have two females, so may have<br/>\npups again soon-ish.  I know there&#39;s a breeder in Ardmore, too, who says she<br/>\nwill have pups mid-summer, but those are the only ones I know about in<br/>\nOklahoma so far.  Where do you live, Karen?  I&#39;m *considering* breeding,<br/>\ntoo, but it will be at least 2 years before we had pups....probably more<br/>\nlike 3 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI notice that Sarah said she was going to attach a photo but there was no<br/>\nattachment.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s because the list doesn&#39;t accept them or<br/>\nif she forgot or had a problem, but I&#39;ll try attaching a (small) photo of<br/>\nSparky, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really will try participating in some of the more intellectual<br/>\nconversation soon.  :-)  My daughter&#39;s birthday is today and she has 5 girls<br/>\nover for a party right now, so I&#39;m a little distracted.

The title is<br/>\n&quot;The First Honest Book About Lies&quot; (if, in fact, we&#39;re talking about the<br/>\nsame book!) and here&#39;s the URL at Amazon.com if others would like to read<br/>\nabout it:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0915793431\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0915793431</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few others listed as &quot;Customers who bought this book also<br/>\nbought:&quot; that looked interesting, too.  (I love that feature of Amazon!)<br/>\nIt&#39;s really a *wonderful* book for both adults and young adults...opens up<br/>\navenues for lots of interesting conversations.  I got mine from Holt&#39;s<br/>\nbookstore several years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m new here--first post.  I knew about the list, but had sort of weaned<br/>\nmyself off lists and wasn&#39;t looking to join any others.  But an unschooling<br/>\nadventure led me here by way of Sarah Carothers, so here I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nI met Sarah on a dogs email list.  :-)  I had just bought a puppy and joined<br/>\nthis particular list to learn more about the breed (hence my unschooling<br/>\nadventure).  Sarah and I both have the same breed of dog, Havanese, (and we<br/>\nboth bought the dogs quite recently), they&#39;re almost exactly the same age<br/>\nand when we exchanged photos last night we found out they look just alike!<br/>\nWe started corresponding when I mentioned that I homeschool.  Turns out we<br/>\nhave a lot in common besides our new puppies.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking through the list of listmembers, I recognize several names.
