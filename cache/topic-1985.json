One thing I<br/>\nwould ask, about a child diagnosed with ADHD, is HOW was that diagnosis<br/>\ndetermined?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn many cases, the diagnosis is made too quickly....only by asking the<br/>\nparents/caretakers questions about the childs behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we went to have our son diagnosed, it took nearly 3 months.  Our<br/>\npediatrician first did a complete physical..including blood work and<br/>\nurinalysis to rule out any PHYSICAL causes for his behavior (which included<br/>\nhyperactivity and distractability nearly ALL the time in ALL situations).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were then referred to a counselor who exclusively works with ADHD<br/>\nkids....she interviewed us and our child....went over all the<br/>\nforms/questionaires filled out by us and all of Tims&#39; teachers.  Her opinion<br/>\nwas he was ADHD...but she wanted to do further testing to determine if there<br/>\nwere any audio and/or visual perception problems, along with aptitude and<br/>\nachievement testing.  Unfortunately, our insurance forced us to see a<br/>\npsychologist for this testing.  (It took us going through 3 of them before<br/>\nwe found one we liked).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe psychologist we worked with had us and all the other adults in his life<br/>\nfill out forms/questionaires again.  Then, he met with Tim and us several<br/>\ntimes...just to get to know us.  Last, he had our boy take the TOVA test (a<br/>\ntwo part computer test which measures the attention of our son...both audio<br/>\nand visual).  Based on ALL the tests, meetings, and forms, and given the<br/>\nfact we could not find a physical cause (such as epilespy or thyroid<br/>\ncondition), it was determined that Tim is ADHD/gifted.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did NOT have our school case study evaluate him for ADHD initially.<br/>\nHowever, the district did do a full case study evaluation....the outcome was<br/>\nthe same.  The only difference was the recommended treatment:  the school<br/>\nwanted him drugged...the rest of the professionals we worked with said NO<br/>\n(we did meet with the psychologist for many role-playing and behavior<br/>\nmodification sessions.).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not shy away from a child with ADHD because he/she is on meds.  I<br/>\nwould ask if the child is also in counseling....meds alone is NOT enough.<br/>\nThe child needs to be taught how to cope.  Our psychologist is also<br/>\nADHD....he was on meds at one time...and now only uses ritalin occasionally.<br/>\nNot all ADHD&#39;ers need meds, but ALL need counseling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh and I are also considering becoming foster/adoptive parents...I feel<br/>\nthe experience with our son as made us able to be in a position to help<br/>\nanother youngster.
