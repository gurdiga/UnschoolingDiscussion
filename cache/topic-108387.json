Yes, the way <br/>\nBonnie Bee &quot;kinned&quot; her grandson was a wonderful example of the kind of <br/>\nrelationship we should be striving for with our own children -- but the <br/>\nsource is rotten, and that taints the whole thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, the author was not just a bad guy who happened to write a great <br/>\nstory -- he was a master at manipulating the human emotion.  He had <br/>\nstudied how to do that very thing, and brought it to fruition with his <br/>\nslogan for the governor&#39;s campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat he did in the book was to perpetuate the myth of the &quot;noble savage&quot; <br/>\n-- incidentally disrespecting many of their real traditions along the <br/>\nway.  Some words he used were nonsense words, not even aboriginal <br/>\nlanguages.  It is unclear whether he was trying an experiment to see how <br/>\nfar he could mess with people&#39;s thinking -- I know there are several <br/>\nacademics who have written that that was his motivation, but as he <br/>\ncannot defend himself I will give him the benefit of a doubt.  There is <br/>\nno question, however, that he didn&#39;t do enough research into the <br/>\nauthenticity of everything he presented as Native culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also no doubt that he was a really messed up guy -- the drunken <br/>\nbar brawl he was in was with his own son, whom he had abandoned (along <br/>\nwith his wife and the rest of his children) several years before in <br/>\norder to reinvent himself as a folksy Native American storyteller.  <br/>\nThose who knew him in his final years had never been told of his <br/>\nprevious life as a speechwriter and family man, and were horrified when <br/>\nthose facts came out after his death.  Many people felt betrayed by what <br/>\nhe did, including many Native Americans whom he had &quot;befriended&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt never had any children, and never claimed he did.  He did have <br/>\nvast experience with other people&#39;s children, however -- that is why I <br/>\nam willing to look at what he wrote about how children learn.  If he <br/>\nturned out to be a twisted individual who had harmed his own family and <br/>\nbeen an active and vicious member of the Klan; had written his books <br/>\nspecifically to play on the emotion of kind-hearted people; and  those <br/>\nwho were closest to him in his earlier years were forthright about his <br/>\nmanipulativeness and  skewed tendencies, I wouldn&#39;t be recommending him, <br/>\neither.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of those on this list who have been the most prolific have also <br/>\nmade errors in their earlier lives, but they have been gracious and <br/>\nhumble enough to share them, and to show how they would -- and do! -- do <br/>\nthings differently now.  I know Sandra didn&#39;t come from the best of <br/>\ncircumstances, but she has made a difference in the lives of many on <br/>\nthis list by what she shares.  She doesn&#39;t seek to twist things to <br/>\nprovide beautiful examples.  She simply leads a beautiful life, and <br/>\nallows us glimpses of what works -- and doesn&#39;t work -- for her and her <br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe author of the book, on the other hand, came from fairly decent <br/>\ncircumstances and both hinted and outright lied in order to sell a book <br/>\nwhich actually does damage to the very people it claimed to &quot;champion&quot; <br/>\n-- both by its lack of veracity about being autobiographical and by its <br/>\nfalse and misleading content.  Just the sick feeling of being &quot;played&quot; <br/>\nby anyone unfortunate enough to have fallen in love with the characters <br/>\nand the concept (and I count myself among those numbers) is enough to <br/>\nmake those readers cautious about any similar stories, and that is a shame.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebi, duped and disgusted by it<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSally Brooks wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I was totally ignorant of the background information about the author <br/>\n&gt;when I watched this movie with my 12yo dd.

Carter, a right-wing radio announcer and founder of his own Ku Klux Klan <br/>\norganization, was a man with a dark, troubling past. &quot;He had a long history of <br/>\nviolence, in fact, it’s not an exaggeration to call him something of a kind <br/>\nof psychopath,&quot; says Wallace biographer Dan Carter. Asa Carter had shot two men <br/>\nin a dispute over money just a few years before joining Wallace’s campaign, <br/>\nand his Klan group shared his volatile temperament. &quot;In one eighteen-month <br/>\nperiod,&quot; recounts Dan Carter in his George Wallace biography, &quot;his followers <br/>\njoined in the stoning of Autherine Lucy on the University of Alabama campus, <br/>\nassaulted black singer Nat King Cole on a Birmingham stage, beat Birmingham civil <br/>\nrights activist Fred Shuttlesworth and stabbed his wife, and, in what was billed <br/>\nas a warning to potential black ‘trouble-makers,’ castrated a <br/>\nrandomly-chosen, slightly retarded black handyman.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPolitical observers noted a new punch in Wallace’s stump speeches during the ‘<br/>\n62 campaign, and Carter was credited for the change. &quot;[Asa Carter] was this <br/>\nlittle quiet guy who always looked like he needed a shave,&quot; remembers Alabama <br/>\njournalist Wayne Greenhaw. &quot;He was a hell of a writer. I mean, he knew how to <br/>\nput words together.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Wallace’s victory in 1962, Carter was charged with writing a memorable <br/>\ninaugural speech and he leapt at the chance to make history. &quot;He worked on that <br/>\nthing for two or three weeks,&quot; says Dan Carter, &quot;holed up in a hotel room, as <br/>\none of his friends said, chain-smoking one cigarette after another. And when <br/>\nhe got through, he came to see George Wallace. He handed him the speech. And <br/>\nhe took his finger and pointed to one line. And he said, &#39;Read it -- <br/>\nsegregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever -- that&#39;s the line people are <br/>\ngonna remember,&#39; he said.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;And Wallace picked it up,&quot; says Alabama journalist Bob Ingram, &quot;and looked <br/>\nat it and said, &quot;I like that line. I like it, and I’m going to use it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCarter proved valuable to Wallace’s administration and continued to draw his <br/>\npaycheck during Wallace’s first term in office. &quot;Asa Carter was a most <br/>\nintegral part of the George Wallace organization,&quot; remembers Wallace’s former finance <br/>\ndirector Seymore Trammell. &quot;He was a man that had connections, good <br/>\nconnections with the underworld, you might say. He was our go-between between the <br/>\ngovernor and with the Ku Klux Klan. He could keep those people quiet, or either he <br/>\ncould get them to be very disturbed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCarter’s speechwriting services reached national audiences again when Wallace <br/>\nstood in the schoolhouse door of the University of Alabama, barring two <br/>\nAfrican American students from entering. All the major networks would carry Wallace’<br/>\ns symbolic stand and his statement, &quot;[I] do hereby denounce and forbid this <br/>\nillegal and unwarranted action by the central government.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, as the times changed and the political climate in Alabama and the <br/>\nnation softened, Carter, ever the hard-liner, became less and less enamored of <br/>\nWallace’s evolving attitude on race. He ran as a fringe candidate for governor <br/>\nagainst Wallace in 1970 and finished at the bottom of the pack with his <br/>\nracially-charged, divisive campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a remarkable turnaround, Asa Carter remade his image in his later life, <br/>\nmoving to Texas and becoming a writer under the pseudonym Forrest Carter. As <br/>\nForrest Carter, he had a string of successes including &quot;The Rebel Outlaw: Jose <br/>\nWales&quot; which became a Hollywood movie starring Clint Eastwood. He also penned <br/>\nthe &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller &quot;The Education of Little Tree,&quot; a fictitious <br/>\naccount of his childhood as a Native American orphan. Oddly, this &quot;true story&quot; <br/>\nbecame a favorite among the liberal-minded people he had despised throughout his <br/>\nlife. Carter died in 1979 before his double identity reached national <br/>\nattention.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7527178,"authorName":"CelticFrau@aol.com","from":"CelticFrau@...","profile":"celticfrau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] the education of Little Tree","postDate":"1127138763","msgId":108397,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFmYy5hNjkxZjE0LjMwNjAxZmNiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":108395,"nextInTopic":108399,"prevInTime":108396,"nextInTime":108398,"topicId":108387,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/19/2005 9:28:23 AM Eastern Standard Time, ... as anything but fiction.
