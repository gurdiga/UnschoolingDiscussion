I suppose this is what I<br/>\nlike.  It is incredibly challenging to look at one&#39;s self honestly.<br/>\nIdentifying unhealthy, unfounded, and imbedded forms of thinking and<br/>\ntrying to change these ideas is difficult, at best.  The results of<br/>\nlooking inward and doing the work and changing unproductive thought<br/>\npatterns is liberating.  People who ask questions in a TCS forum are<br/>\nsearching for answers, they are opening themselves up to critical and<br/>\nrational thinking in order to improve their lives and open their minds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to respectfully disagree with the following statement:<br/>\n&quot;Pro-common preferences parents convey, to me, impression that they are<br/>\nraising a &quot;superior&quot; brand of child by using a &quot;superior&quot; brand of<br/>\nparenting..&quot;  I understand why this appears to be true.  TCS supporters,<br/>\nhowever, don&#39;t view parenting as producing a product.  They are not<br/>\nconcerned with superior and inferior labels.  In fact, I would say TCS<br/>\npeople have to get over any kind of notion of superior to fully embrace<br/>\na TCS philosophy.  The philosophy is about embracing what is unique<br/>\nabout each individual.  If that means re-evaluating priorities, faith,<br/>\neducation, social standing, etc., they do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nTCS parents seem, to me, to be continually searching for a better way to<br/>\nparent, a better understanding of themselves, and a way to become more<br/>\nopen to an array of possibilities.  I don&#39;t see TCS parents as seeing<br/>\nthemselves as superior.  I think most of them are trying to better<br/>\n*themselves*.  When they do respond to a query in a forum, they are<br/>\ntrying to help other people open their own minds.  TCS parents are more<br/>\nwilling to look at honest criticism than any other group I have<br/>\nencountered.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it sounds pretty rough when your ideas are dissected.   I, for<br/>\none, love to have my ideas challenged.  I either face the fact that they<br/>\nare antiquated and work on changing, or I grow firmer in my resolve.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Anderson-Thimmes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mother_of_fancy@...\">mother_of_fancy@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I think fundamentalism can take on many forms and cover a wide range<br/>\n&gt; of issues, TCS and unschooling included.
