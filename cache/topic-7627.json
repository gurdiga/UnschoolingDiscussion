I want to be <br/>\nable to trust the kids,too, but it is very difficult.  It is as if we, the <br/>\nex-teachers , need the de-schooling.  All the yrs as children in schools, <br/>\nthen college, then teaching in the schools adds up to alot to shut out of a <br/>\nperson&#39;s mind, no matter how much other philophies make sense.  I have read <br/>\nHolt, and agree with most everything I have read.  He,too, was a teacher; <br/>\nhowever, I don&#39;t think he was a parent.  My point is that living with <br/>\nchildren 24hrs a day, 7 days a week, is different than being with them for <br/>\nprescribed hours each day.  When I taught, I was not a parent.  When I became <br/>\na parent, my ideas about educ. did change radically.  I cannot fathom putting <br/>\nmy kids in school, and I know homeschooling is definitely the best for <br/>\nchildren, but I, too, find what works for me- at least for now- is a blending <br/>\nof sorts.  I encourage  and offer ideas, and at times I fight the frustration <br/>\nof having ideas rejected, and the &quot;teacher&quot; in me wants to rear up and &quot;take <br/>\ncharge&quot;.  This is why I am researching other ideas like  C Mason , and Samuel <br/>\nBlumenfeld.  I don&#39;t know how much of it I may use, but I am open to learning <br/>\nas much as I can about it all.  What each family ultimately feels most <br/>\ncomfortable  with in the long run, is what will matter most, and that&#39;s what <br/>\nI&#39;m trying to keep in mind.                                                     <br/>\n            Karen--still learning all the time,too</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7488,"nextTopicId":7628}}
