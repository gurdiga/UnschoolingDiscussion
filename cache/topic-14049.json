I just can&#39;t accept the idea that endless <br/>\nplaying of video games constitutes an intellectual pursuit.  (And yes, <br/>\nSandra, I have played the games with my kids.  I *do* know what they&#39;re <br/>\nabout!)  To me, thinking of video games like Super Smash Brothers as a <br/>\nlearning activity is the equivalent of saying that a bag of Doritos, a candy <br/>\nbar and a Coke constitute a good dinner.  Tasty perhaps, but ultimately not <br/>\nvery nourishing.  Thanks for your idea, Valerie!
