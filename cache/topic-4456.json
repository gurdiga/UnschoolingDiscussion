Here we teach <br/>\nthe first-shift (the part time boys :-() and, as far as we can, the <br/>\nsecond-shift about safety.  The boys are nearing the age where the <br/>\ndrugs and the gangs will be after them (especially if they stay <br/>\nwhere they are) and my husband wanted me to teach the boys <br/>\nwhat I know about identifying trouble (I sure got into enough &lt;G&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have also been working on their memories.  I will ask them, <br/>\nafter Terry has been in bed for an hour or so &quot;What did Terry where <br/>\ntoday?&quot;.  We want the boys to be able to help should the <br/>\nunthinkable ever happen.  People identification, car identification, <br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also teach them about gun safety (we have 3 rifles and 2 1/2 <br/>\npistols (the third is a single shot black powder jobie we have no <br/>\nammo for, more a collector piece than anything) in our home.  All 4 <br/>\nchildren will be getting their NRA memberships for Saturnalia.  We <br/>\nwill also enroll them in a gun safety class this summer (maybe <br/>\nsooner).  The boys will not be getting a gun of their own until they <br/>\nare a few years older.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving where we do (50 miles outside of Houston) I am probably <br/>\nbeing paranoid, but I&#39;d rather err on the side of caution &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nPax,<br/>\nCrys</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4445,"nextTopicId":4453}}
