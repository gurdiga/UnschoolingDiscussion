All of my kids are at University as Engineering Majors and no we are not Engineers ourselves this is just the field they all liked.  Will your husband be able to help your children as needed?  Will he be home most of the time that they are home?  Do you have supportive friends or family nearby?  How old is the oldest child, can he/she babysit?  Will you be working close enough to drive home at lunch?  There is always a way to make it happen if you really want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have spent way too much time playing games on the computer and talking to internet friends both of which they would not do if we were regular schoolers.  Because of this they are very good at computers and have gotten part time jobs as web designers, etc.  They have not learned many traditional things but most schoolers have not learned what they have taught themselves.  Do not worry about grades, mine never had a grade until college and get all A&#39;s and B&#39;s.
