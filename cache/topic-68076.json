There were a lot of little things that bothered me about E, so I <br/>\nfigured it was my own biases or experiences that were coming through...not <br/>\nreally reflecting E so much as myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example:  E always &#39;picked&#39; at her crotch.  Somewhat like picking a <br/>\nwedgie but in a constant, obvious kind of way and up front, not behind.  I <br/>\nknow children who are sexually abused ten to have these sort of reactions <br/>\nand that thought never left my mind.  She was also always dirty, wore <br/>\nclothes that were either way too big or way too small.  She was overweight <br/>\nand had very large breasts, in proportion to her overall size and never wore <br/>\na training bra.  She really needed one.  Much of the time, her breasts were <br/>\nexposed through huge armholes of shirts without sleeves.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were other things that bothered us as well...my husband and I.  She <br/>\nmade a very big deal about whispering and telling secrets.  I realize girls <br/>\nlove to do these things and it is quite normal.  However, there seemed to be <br/>\nsomething different about it with E.  Not really something I could put my <br/>\nfinger on, but something my husband and I just couldn&#39;t get past.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was ALWAYS at our house.  She would show up early in the am and I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t see or hear from her parents at all.  Many times we would call and <br/>\nnot get an answer.  I started to feel like a babysitter.  There were many <br/>\ntimes I would tell E it was time to go home and she would say her parents <br/>\nwere at church, of all places!, and wouldn&#39;t be back until X time.  No one <br/>\neven TOLD us we were babysitting!  Once, I sent her home and she came back <br/>\nFIVE hours later and said her parents still weren&#39;t home and could she <br/>\nplease spend the night.  That was my last straw.  I called her mother and <br/>\nhad it out.  She made some excuse that E had said it was ok to stay with us <br/>\nso I told her from then on, we...the mother and I...would have to speak <br/>\ndirectly any time E came over.  We still had problems but nothing compared <br/>\nto what started happening after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaleigh began to get very depressed.  I tried talking to er numerous times <br/>\nand she would tell me it was nothing.  I knew better and gently prodded for <br/>\nsome idea of what was going on.  Turns out no one wanted to play with her <br/>\nbut E.  Everyone in the neighborhood disliked E and because Haleigh was her <br/>\nfriend they wanted nothing to do with her either.  I happened to be outside <br/>\nonce and overheard a huge fight between about 10 kids, all telling Haleigh <br/>\nand E to get lost.  One of the kids belonged to my neighbor so I talked with <br/>\nhim, the dad, about it.  e called his daughter in and they explained that it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t Haleigh that was doing anything.  E was calliing people names and <br/>\nHaleigh just stood by silently and watched it happen.  I had a long talk <br/>\nwith Haleigh and E.  For a short while, things improved again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last time they were together, Nicholette came in crying and screaming.  <br/>\nShe took me outside and showed me the most horrific thing I think I&#39;ve ever <br/>\nseen a child do.  E had taken Nicholette&#39;s brand new doll and painted it red <br/>\nwith nail polish.  She drew a slash across the neck with blood dripping down <br/>\nand cut it almost completely off with a pair of scissors.  It was tied with <br/>\na rope by the neck and hung on our back fence.  The entire doll was almost <br/>\ncompletely covered in &#39;blood&#39;.  By this time, E was gone and Haleigh was <br/>\nsitting in the treehouse crying.  She was afraid to tell me because she <br/>\nthought I would think she did it!  That was totally unlike her!<br/>\n<br/>\nI ended up going to the police with the doll and my long story.  I was <br/>\ntraumatized and didn&#39;t know what else to do.  I explained the story, my <br/>\nconcerns, all the little things that bothered me.  The officer told me they <br/>\nhad  long history with E&#39;s family.  Her mother had just been committed to <br/>\nthe hospital for a suicide attempt.  E had told me her mom was in the <br/>\nhospital but said it was for diabetes.  Her Dad told us the same thing!  The <br/>\nofficer als told us that there were &#39;suspicions&#39; of other &#39;inappropriate <br/>\nactivity&#39; in the home and they were under investigation.  I was appalled and <br/>\nhorrified.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe sat down with Haleigh and tried to explain everything to her in terms she <br/>\nwould understand without overloading her with unneeded information that <br/>\nmight scare her even more.  By that time she was almost 10.  It was very <br/>\nhard but once she was relived of the relationship, she blossomed and became <br/>\nour happy child again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that time, I thought I was helping by offering a positive environment <br/>\nfor E to be in.  I knew her parents weren&#39;t the most interested, but I also <br/>\nhad all those nagging thoughts which I tried to reason away.  Her parents <br/>\nalways seemed to have the right answer for everything and I know now I was <br/>\nfar too trusting of them.  I learned an awful lesson.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are now very careful about who our children have as friends.  I wish I <br/>\nhad trusted my own instincts and reported my suspicions in the beginning.  I <br/>\nwish I had connected my daughters depression to her friendship with E.  I <br/>\nwish I wasn&#39;t so hard pressed to &quot;save&quot; E that I let my own daughter suffer <br/>\nas a result.  For some reason, I just didn&#39;t see it when it was hitting me <br/>\nright in the nose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want my children to be able to make friends and chose their own friends <br/>\nbut at the same time, I am now very aware of any warning signs and address <br/>\nthem immediately.  I follow my gut feelings and if things don&#39;t feel right, <br/>\nI step in.  I&#39;m sure this is far more seious than what you are dealing with. <br/>\n  I just wanted to share what happened to us because I think it is so easy <br/>\nto want to &#39;save&#39; children in bad and unfortunate situations.  I didn&#39;t <br/>\n*see* it for what it was until it damaged my child.  I think young children <br/>\nare very imperssionable, especially those that have a narrower group of <br/>\nfriends, and are more willing to hang on rather than look away and find <br/>\nsomeone else.  I find this true of a lot of homeschoolers I know...sometimes <br/>\nmy family included!  When you aren&#39;t involved in church or many outside <br/>\nactivities and the neighborhood isn&#39;t swarming with children it can be <br/>\ndifficult to provide a large assortment of friendly possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you WILL follow your instincts and get to the bottom of any problens <br/>\nyou have with this family.  I would definitely speak up and if the answers I <br/>\ngot didn&#39;t match what I was seeing I&#39;d throw up the red flags and monitor <br/>\nclosely and  wouldn&#39;t wait around until something really bad happened.  What <br/>\nhappened to us was very extreme, but even smaller things can be damaging to <br/>\na child&#39;s self esteem and reasoning abilities.  It sounds like the red flags <br/>\nare going up for your son also.  Something I would for sure address.  I&#39;d <br/>\nalso check the status of the rabies shots on the dog and report it if he <br/>\nisn&#39;t up to date.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I did address the doll issue with E&#39;s parents and she LAUGHED!  &quot;Kids <br/>\nwill be kids and they do silly stuff like that.&quot;  I told her I completely <br/>\ndisagreed and that E was no longer welcome in our home or allowed to contact <br/>\nHaleigh.  It was one of the hardest things I&#39;ve had to do but I&#39;m SO glad I <br/>\ndid it.  Funny, SHE thought *I* was being overprotective!  Wouldn&#39;t have <br/>\nhurt her to take a few pointers, if you ask me!<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this went on so long!  I hope things work out for you and your son.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s hard being a parent sometimes, isn&#39;t it!?!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
