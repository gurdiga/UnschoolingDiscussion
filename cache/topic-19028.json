People (mostly family, for me) get jealous just <br/>\nbecause I&#39;m living my life MY way.

I don&#39;t say the jealousy is right, I <br/>\njust understand where they are coming from. Do you have supportive <br/>\nfriends? I believe we have two families in this life: the one we were <br/>\nborn into and the one we form with friends that love us for who we<br/>\nare and what we try to do.

I think you are right above, <br/>\nCarolyn. During this time,  I was also disabled from a motorcycle accident I <br/>\nwas in with him and I&#39;ve worried about that, and you know what it is really-  <br/>\nI have had no support from family at all (upon finding out how badly I was <br/>\nhurt and that her father had left us- my brother told my then two year old <br/>\nthat she needed to go home with him- it really cut me to the core.  If he <br/>\nwere the last human on earth, she would NEVER go with him or anyone else in <br/>\nmy family of origin), and the more hurt and in pain I was, the more they <br/>\ntried to scare me with all kinds of things.  My family is crazy.  Very <br/>\nself-centered people.  I think because they have given me such a hard time in <br/>\nthe past (now, I am much better and everything is coming together- so I don&#39;t <br/>\ncare much or allow them to hurt me any longer- I will also be leaving them <br/>\nbehind soon), I have had this fear that a higher &quot;authority&quot; will try to hurt <br/>\nme or judge me in some way and I&#39;ll have to explain myself.  It does make <br/>\nsense inside my heart and mind that they won&#39;t even ask me anything.  I <br/>\nreally know it will come together very easily, in the way that Ariel and I <br/>\nneed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBoy, what a load off my shoulders this is!  :-)  I guess I just need(ed) some <br/>\nreassurance.  I&#39;ve had a tough time with people (usually those supposedly <br/>\n&#39;close&#39; to me) judging me and my life.  When it is the best and most pleasant <br/>\nlife for us I know.  I&#39;m starting to believe that people are actually jealous <br/>\nof the way we choose to live our lives, and in this jealousy, they try to <br/>\nhurt us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!
