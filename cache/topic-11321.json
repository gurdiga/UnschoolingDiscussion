You will not need to <br/>\nadhere to a stricter schedule, and you will not have to battle through a <br/>\npurchased curriculum that may have topics uninteresting to your child.  For <br/>\nexample, a commercial reading series may have stories that bore your child, <br/>\nbut letting him help select books geared to his interest level will help to <br/>\nhold his attention.  Also, you will not need to create a schedule where you <br/>\naccomplish academics from 8 am to noon or whatever, each day.  You and your <br/>\nchild may find you function better and relate better when working on things <br/>\nfrom , say, noon till 2:00, then break, then work on something later in the <br/>\nday or evenings.  The point is that you have an abundance of freedom to make <br/>\nyour unique situation work for you and your family, and that it just takes <br/>\nsome time to find the &quot;right&quot; method  and schedule that suits you best.   I <br/>\nthink, too, that young children need lots of outdoor physical play.  My <br/>\noldest son will soon be 6, and he benefits from a lot of play in the <br/>\nmornings.

He is an extremely<br/>\nhigh energy child and reenergizes by interacting with others. Questions non<br/>\nstop, always bouncing around and moving. Sit still and &quot;do homework&quot;!?<br/>\nNearly impossible, and quickly becoming unthinkable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a hard time keeping up with his energy levels. Regular homeschooling<br/>\nis easier for me-but Seamus rarely gets fully engaged with this sort of<br/>\nlearning, so I&#39;ve been changing to meet his needs. It&#39;s tiring, but the<br/>\ndesire in me is there.  I&#39;m motivated to change every time I see him get<br/>\nengaged in a sloppy unstructured &quot;lesson&quot;.  It&#39;s like a moment of zen, or an<br/>\nepiphany, or the first time I ever ate Butter Toffee ice cream (mmm mmm mmm<br/>\ngood!).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for me, the hardest thing to overcome during my transition from<br/>\nhomeschooling to unschooling is constant drain on my energy level.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was the hardest thing for you-or was it a snap?
