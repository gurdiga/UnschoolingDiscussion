Or maybe it isn&#39;t my age, but the level of <br/>\nstress I have now with more children after all those 10 years with <br/>\none very laid back kid!  In any case I recognize some of these <br/>\ncharacteristics people are describing in myself.  I have always <br/>\ncried too easily in my opinion, and when I am concentrating on <br/>\nsomething, I will practically jump out of my skin if someone <br/>\nsuddenly says something to me or comes into my periphiral(sp?) <br/>\nvision from another room or touches me when I didn&#39;t know they were <br/>\nso close, etc...  My girlfriend has told me for the past several <br/>\nyears that she doesn&#39;t like to talk to me while I drive!! I have <br/>\ntrouble doing simple things if there is too much going on in the <br/>\nroom.  I often don&#39;t like any help in the kitchen because of this, <br/>\nand that bothers me because I want my children to be able to come in <br/>\nand learn from watching and doing with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, when I am present in the moment, or just very relaxed and <br/>\nwell-rested, this isn&#39;t an issue.  I can drive well and talk <br/>\nfluidly, watch a movie while knitting (without making mistakes!), <br/>\nread a story to my children while the 3 year old hums,  read a <br/>\nrecipe while my children ask me to lick the bowl or the beaters, <br/>\netc, etc, etc....<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, what I&#39;m realizing is that I&#39;m not always a basket-case.  <br/>\nThere are times when everything just flows and nothing bothers me.  <br/>\nIt seems like this could also be helped by practising mindfulness <br/>\nand breathing!  And, of course, getting enough rest...hmmm....This <br/>\nis interesting to me.
