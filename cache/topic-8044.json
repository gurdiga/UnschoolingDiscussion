There are still some<br/>\nstates (Alaska for one) that still has a homesteading law that enables<br/>\nyou to stake a claim on remote pieces of land.  If you build a cabin or<br/>\nhouse stay there a certain amount of time and meet all the requirements<br/>\nthe land is yours.  <br/>\n    What I mean by homesteading is a little different.  My definition is<br/>\nto move to a piece of land that  is remote or not, but very unimproved,<br/>\nand start from scratch.  Live there as you are making the improvements<br/>\nand building the house.  Living off the land as much as possible.<br/>\nKyle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8042,"nextTopicId":8045}}
