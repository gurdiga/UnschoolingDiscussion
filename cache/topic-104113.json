My little sister is pregnant with her <br/>\nfirst baby and will be a single mom.  I will be caring for the baby <br/>\nwhile she works.  She seems receptive to AP and plans to breastfeed, but <br/>\nshe has not read anything I have given her nor has she taken much of my <br/>\nadvice about pregnancy diet, etc.  I too am walking the line.  It seems <br/>\nso much harder when the child in question is a family member--a beloved <br/>\nniece or nephew or grandchild.  It&#39;s giving me some perspective on what <br/>\nit must be like for my family when they see me doing things that are <br/>\n&quot;wierd&quot; with my kids.  Co-sleeping was a big one for my mom--she was <br/>\ngenuinely afraid I would smother the baby.  Oh, and homebirth was <br/>\nanother big one.  And right now my little sis is living with my mom so <br/>\nthere is a lot of what I consider negative influence for me to try to <br/>\ncounter without damaging my relationship with my mom or my sister.  It&#39;s <br/>\nall very tricky.<br/>\n<br/>\nIronically, some of the best advice I got about this was from my <br/>\nmother.  When my first was little, I was really worried about letting <br/>\nhim spend any time at all with my MIL because she is a very negative and <br/>\njudgmental person and I was afraid she would hurt his feelings or that <br/>\nit would &quot;rub off&quot; on him.  My mom advised me that ds and MIL will need <br/>\nto work out their own relationship and I can not control it.  As long as <br/>\nhe still wants to pursue the relationship with her, which he does, who <br/>\nam I to step in and tell them how to interact?  Of course I do draw the <br/>\nline at spanking and punishments, but really I don&#39;t have to because ds <br/>\nwould simply choose not to visit her if she did that.  She knows it too, <br/>\nand she knows I wouldn&#39;t make him go.  And when he was a baby he was <br/>\nnever alone with her so I didn&#39;t have feeding issues or anything.  So <br/>\nfor right now this is working.  Perhaps as you grandparent your little <br/>\none you can discuss this idea with your DIL--that you and your <br/>\ngrandchild will have a different relationship than they will have with <br/>\neach other, but that&#39;s OK.

I&#39;m  the <br/>\nonly one of his grandmothers who doesn&#39;t work.  It will be convenient  for them <br/>\nand they love to travel, so I&#39;m certain it will come up.  (I do  suspect Jake <br/>\nwill be more likely to want the baby with him all the time, since  he won&#39;t <br/>\nget to know the baby until he gets back from Iraq, so my supposing  could all <br/>\nchange.)  I can&#39;t give it breastmilk unless she&#39;s pumping, and  I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nshe&#39;ll be nursing (although I did send her Dr. Spears&#39; book).   I&#39;ve been saving <br/>\nWill&#39;s crib for the grandbabies, but I&#39;ve already decided this  baby is <br/>\nsleeping with me, if I get to have it overnight.

My MIL spanked her daughter for repeatedly jumping on MIL airbed (like the Sleep Number bed) even when asked to please stop etc. There have also been dog incidents were my niece was particularly mean to the animals. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, my SIL freaked out - which has saved the rest of us from this potentially happening at our house. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I do think it stems from the fact that my MIL was not doing any different than she did with her kids and feels that all  they &quot;turned out fine&quot;. I don&#39;t think there was malice intended - but she was reacting in the same way she had reacted to her kids. My SIL was particularly sensitive because her own father had been abusive and so there is no spanking on her end.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a time with my MIL when she thought I babied Chase too much because he never would just be put in his crib and go to sleep. He always wanted to be rocked and nursed and if he didn&#39;t fall asleep nursing - he didn&#39;t sleep. She believed in the &quot;cry it out theory&quot;. So we have often been at odds - but I will say that she recognizes that I just do things differently. I can tell by some comments that she makes that she thinks I am too permissive, not organized(scheduled), etc.  She has babysat a few times when I have worked a week-long intensive University course and has everyone regimented. Naps scheduled, shoes must always be worn outside, laundry is all done and folded - chores are regimented. My husband thinks its great - he grew up this way. I think its insane. I can see the benefits of some of her ideas - but I am just not that way. I don&#39;t like to wear shoes outside in summer - I don&#39;t mind if they splash in puddles - and I am really unstructured. She really thinks this is detrimental, that kids need to learn discipline etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do wish my husband would relax a bit more - and not feel as if life needs to be run like an army camp. After 12 years of marrige I think its growing on him - and seeing how happy anf free our kids are.... His view has been changing - but slowly.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: juliewinar <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, March 04, 2005 1:23 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: usurping authority<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; It has  taken years of conditioning to get my parents and MIL to this <br/>\n  &gt; point of  leaving us alone...their training began the day my MIL fed my <br/>\n  &gt; exclusivly  breast-fed, top of the chart 4 month old &quot;cereal&quot; when we <br/>\n  &gt; left him (along  with bottles of breast milk) with her for 4 hours<br/>\n  while <br/>\n  &gt; we went to dh&#39;s  class reunion....she never tried to usurp our position <br/>\n  &gt; as parents  again.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; =============================<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt; When I read things like that, I have sympathy for the  <br/>\n  &gt; babysitter/in-law/parent.<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt; I think feeding a four month old cereal was very bad, but as to<br/>\n  &quot;usurping the position of parents,&quot; I think it&#39;s better to talk to the<br/>\n  kids about dealing with the relatives than to command the relatives to<br/>\n  behave as we would.<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Well a 4 month old can&#39;t really deal with a memaw who&#39;s spooning food<br/>\n  into his mounth instead of that bottle he&#39;d rather have.<br/>\n  Of course this all had to do with the discussion about dyslexia and<br/>\n  ds&#39;s choice of using the word as a way to &quot;deal&quot; with relatives. <br/>\n  We are lot better now about not throwing ds into situations he would<br/>\n  not be able to deal with and with helping him workout how he will deal<br/>\n  with things that come up.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Usurping&quot; is probably not the best word and my &quot;tounge-in-cheek&quot; tone<br/>\n  (which was in my head when I wrote that) did not come across to well.<br/>\n  I can sound harsh at times.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I just feel so bad for folks when I read how relatives constantly<br/>\n  grill them on their lives and how they are raising/educating their<br/>\n  kids. Some parents and in-laws can be very contolling. It seems to be<br/>\n  a constant theme for homeschoolers and unschoolers alike. We do not<br/>\n  have that problem, from a woman who can be quite controlling with her<br/>\n  other sons wives, and I think it all stems back to that 1st incident.<br/>\n  Its strange, she and I have a better relationship (what little there<br/>\n  is) then she has with any of the other DILs.<br/>\n  The truth is ds did not suffer any ill effects from the food and in<br/>\n  hindsight there were other choices I could have made, from not being<br/>\n  so uberpro-breastfeeding (to the point of being obnoxious at<br/>\n  times...new mom/1st baby syndrome and all that) to not going to the<br/>\n  reunion since I knew what my MIL was like.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Usurping is a harsh word and when I read it, it does sound like a<br/>\n  parent who feels their kid is a posession and I will make your life<br/>\n  misrable if you do not follow all of our instructins. I guess respect<br/>\n  for the choices we are making would work, but the truth is would be<br/>\n  hard pressed to respect the wishes of a DIL that wanted me to spank my<br/>\n  grandkids too. Or force them to do &quot;school work&quot; at my house.....I&#39;d<br/>\n  hate having to force anyones kid to do homework after being in school<br/>\n  all day.<br/>\n  I&#39;m with you, if you have a whole list of things your kid can do at my<br/>\n  house, I&#39;d just rather them not come.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But where do you draw the line as an unschooling parent? What is<br/>\n  non-negotiable? If its not usurping<br/>\n  (hmmmm...presuming/preempting/appropriating/supplanting) to do things<br/>\n  like feeding a vegitarian child meat, forcing an unschooling child to<br/>\n  &quot;do&quot; schoolish stuff, or spanking a non-spanked kid (all in the<br/>\n  context of younger/complacent/fearful kids who would not/could not<br/>\n  fight back but go along)then what is it? <br/>\n  Besides just being plain rude.....<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorry, long again....<br/>\n  Julie W<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; If I ever babysit a grandkid and a parent uses his position to try<br/>\n  to make  <br/>\n  &gt; me spank or punish or put a child to bed in a dark room because the<br/>\n  clock says  <br/>\n  &gt; 8:00, I will absolutely refuse to do it, even if they&#39;re paying me<br/>\n  cash by <br/>\n  &gt; the  hour.<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt; If I babysit other people&#39;s kids and they tell me how their child is<br/>\n  to be  <br/>\n  &gt; treated to the minutest detail, they can take their kids on away<br/>\n  with them,  <br/>\n  &gt; because what they&#39;re really doing is leaving a child at MY house,<br/>\n  where children <br/>\n  &gt;  have survived and are happy.

Some parents and in-laws can be very contolling. It seems to be<br/>\na constant theme for homeschoolers and unschoolers alike. We do not<br/>\nhave that problem, from a woman who can be quite controlling with her<br/>\nother sons wives, and I think it all stems back to that 1st incident.<br/>\nIts strange, she and I have a better relationship (what little there<br/>\nis) then she has with any of the other DILs.<br/>\nThe truth is ds did not suffer any ill effects from the food and in<br/>\nhindsight there were other choices I could have made, from not being<br/>\nso uberpro-breastfeeding (to the point of being obnoxious at<br/>\ntimes...new mom/1st baby syndrome and all that) to not going to the<br/>\nreunion since I knew what my MIL was like.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsurping is a harsh word and when I read it, it does sound like a<br/>\nparent who feels their kid is a posession and I will make your life<br/>\nmisrable if you do not follow all of our instructins. I guess respect<br/>\nfor the choices we are making would work, but the truth is would be<br/>\nhard pressed to respect the wishes of a DIL that wanted me to spank my<br/>\ngrandkids too. Or force them to do &quot;school work&quot; at my house.....I&#39;d<br/>\nhate having to force anyones kid to do homework after being in school<br/>\nall day.<br/>\nI&#39;m with you, if you have a whole list of things your kid can do at my<br/>\nhouse, I&#39;d just rather them not come.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut where do you draw the line as an unschooling parent? What is<br/>\nnon-negotiable? If its not usurping<br/>\n(hmmmm...presuming/preempting/appropriating/supplanting) to do things<br/>\nlike feeding a vegitarian child meat, forcing an unschooling child to<br/>\n&quot;do&quot; schoolish stuff, or spanking a non-spanked kid (all in the<br/>\ncontext of younger/complacent/fearful kids who would not/could not<br/>\nfight back but go along)then what is it? <br/>\nBesides just being plain rude.....<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, long again....<br/>\nJulie W<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I ever babysit a grandkid and a parent uses his position to try<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to make  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; me spank or punish or put a child to bed in a dark room because the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>clock says  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 8:00, I will absolutely refuse to do it, even if they&#39;re paying me<br/>\n </span></blockquote>cash by <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the  hour.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; If I babysit other people&#39;s kids and they tell me how their child is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to be  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; treated to the minutest detail, they can take their kids on away<br/>\n </span></blockquote>with them,  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; because what they&#39;re really doing is leaving a child at MY house,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>where children <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  have survived and are happy.
