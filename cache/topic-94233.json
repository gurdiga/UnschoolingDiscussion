There are people who don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; this idea - they hear it as <br/>\nparents SHOULD/MUST jump up at 10 pm and run to the store to get a kid <br/>\na candy bar just because a kid says, &quot;I want a candy bar.&quot; Because <br/>\nMOSTLY we&#39;re talking to people in a society which is unkind and <br/>\nungenerous and demanding and belittling of children, we mostly talk <br/>\nabout doing MORE for children. But, once in a while we have to <br/>\nbacktrack and say, &quot;Wait - we don&#39;t mean that every little whim has to <br/>\nbe satisfied at that moment.&quot; BUT it does mean not thinking of <br/>\neverything a child desires as &quot;a childish whim,&quot; too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to visit Sandra in Albuquerque. She and Holly, who was 6 years <br/>\nold, I think, picked me up at the airport. We talked a mile a minute as <br/>\nwe left the airport and Holly sat in the back seat and threw in a few <br/>\nof her own thoughts here and there. I&#39;d been with them  and I heard two <br/>\nthings that really impressed me. One, Holly occasionally corrected <br/>\nSandra&#39;s statements - she&#39;d sweetly speak up and say something like, <br/>\n&quot;Well, what he said exactly was this: .......,&quot; or &quot;Mama, was that the <br/>\nday we went swimming in the lake because if it was, then that was <br/>\nKirby, not Marty.&quot; &lt;G&gt; Now we ALL know how young kids sometimes correct <br/>\ntheir parents in front of other people, right? And, as the adult, that <br/>\ncan be irritating because a lot of times the details that they correct <br/>\naren&#39;t important to the point of the story. So - how do people usually <br/>\nreact? Usually with GREAT irritation and impatience and even <br/>\nembarrassment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra said, &quot;Holly has a great memory for details and helps me get <br/>\nthem right.&quot; Then she turned to Holly several times in the next few <br/>\nminutes and asked her a question about the details, &quot;Holly, who was it <br/>\nthat said .....?&quot; &quot;Holly, what exactly was it that Kirby was trying to <br/>\ndo that day that.....?&quot;  Holly didn&#39;t end up a rude and interrupting <br/>\nsocially inept kid because Sandra didn&#39;t shush her and tell her not to <br/>\ninterrupt adult&#39;s conversations and so on. She ended up an absolutely <br/>\ncharming kid who is socially adept and a pleasure to be around because <br/>\nSandra respected her and included her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that happened in that drive from the airport is that <br/>\nHolly said, from the back seat, &quot;I&#39;d sure like some plums.&quot; Not whining <br/>\nor begging, not demanding, just matter-of-fact about it. Sandra said to <br/>\nme, &quot;Do you mind us stopping and buying some plums?&quot; I said no (in <br/>\nfact, I LOVE to go to grocery stores when I&#39;m traveling to parts of the <br/>\ncountry I haven&#39;t been) and so we stopped and went in and looked for <br/>\nplums (this was Memorial weekend, early for plums) but couldn&#39;t find <br/>\nany. So we went back to the car and Sandra said, &quot;We can try another <br/>\ngrocery store.&quot; So we did. No plums. She said, &quot;Well, Holly, there is <br/>\none more grocery store that we could try.&quot; So we did and they had <br/>\nplums. Holly filled a bag with them and ate some on the way home in the <br/>\nback of the car. She thanked her mom and said how GOOD they were and so <br/>\non, several times. It didn&#39;t matter to us that we drove around <br/>\nAlbuquerque a little, I was happy to see it and we were going to talk <br/>\nno matter where we were. Did Holly grow up to be a &quot;spoiled brat?&quot; <br/>\nHardly! She&#39;s generous and thoughtful. And sensible in her <br/>\nexpectations, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Balance was Re: &quot;a taste of his own medicine&quot; andother cruel ideas","postDate":"1084976537","msgId":94279,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlOC4yMGNmOWU3OS4yZGRjYzc5OUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":94273,"nextInTopic":94287,"prevInTime":94278,"nextInTime":94280,"topicId":94233,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/19/04 8:00:42 AM, abzb@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-699236486\">In a message dated 5/19/04 8:00:42 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abzb@...\">abzb@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I think I got what happened.
