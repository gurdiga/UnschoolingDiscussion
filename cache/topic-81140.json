My big concern was continuing to breastfeed around the <br/>\nclock, during fours days of hospitalization pre-surgery for IV anibiotics, then <br/>\nthe sugery and two days post-surgical.<br/>\n<br/>\n       I saw two problems. The drugs in my system were one, which the doctors <br/>\nsaid would be fine as far as the milk was concerned. They just used the <br/>\nchoices that would not pose a threat for breastfeeding. The other problem was <br/>\nphysical logistics, spending several days on a surgical floor without the <br/>\nrooming-in accommodations that maternity hospitalization had provided. <br/>\n<br/>\n       But this was fine too, because my DH traveled back and forth from home <br/>\nevery hour or five hours round the clock with our (sturdy and very agreeable) <br/>\nbaby boy and our preschool aged daughter -- except for  one night feeding, <br/>\nfor which I would pump during the day so DH could feed the baby by bottle on <br/>\ndemand, sometime between midnight and 8 am. (If we hadn&#39;t had our older child to <br/>\nthink about as well, or if either of our own mothers had been able to come <br/>\nstay during that time, even this adaptation might not have been needed.)<br/>\n<br/>\n       It was really comforting to all of us, I think. He had this really key <br/>\nrole -- it wouldn&#39;t have been possible if he hadn&#39;t made it work -- and I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t feel separated or frustrated by my own health in my commitment to the <br/>\nchildren. Our older daughter was calm and happy and never got a chance to miss me. <br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\n       So it all worked out amazingly well, and the bonus was that my daytime <br/>\nmilk supply was actually even better after pumping that extra feeding for a <br/>\nweek. And the surgical incision was nothing compared to the recent C-section <br/>\nincision, so my mobility and ease of sleep and nursing were all much better <br/>\nafter the surgery than I had expected :)  JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Heatherette@...\">Heatherette@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I had my gallbladder out while I was pregnant.

You might remember my<br/>\n&gt; constant complaining about breaking my ankle last year.  Actually, I <br/>\n&gt; pretty much<br/>\n&gt; shattered it.  They had to use a plate with eight screws on the <br/>\n&gt; outside, three<br/>\n&gt; pins on the inside and lots of fake bone plaster stuff to hold it all <br/>\n&gt; together.<br/>\n&gt; Because my feet are deformed a bit from being en pointe at too young <br/>\n&gt; an age,<br/>\n&gt; the surgeon couldn&#39;t move my foot into a neutral position, even while <br/>\n&gt; I was<br/>\n&gt; under anesthesia.  Therefore, my foot was pointed in the cast and I <br/>\n&gt; not have<br/>\n&gt; very limited range of motion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; OK, enough background.  I can walk and climb stairs, but going down <br/>\n&gt; stairs is<br/>\n&gt; still difficult, I don&#39;t have the flexion.  I saw my surgeon in March <br/>\n&gt; and we<br/>\n&gt; talked about having all the metal removed in October, so I&#39;ll be <br/>\n&gt; making an<br/>\n&gt; appointment to see him in the next few weeks.  One of my midwives says <br/>\n&gt; any kind<br/>\n&gt; of surgery, including general anesthesia, is ok in pregnancy.  The <br/>\n&gt; other<br/>\n&gt; midwife says she thinks a local anesthesia would be ok.  The thing is, <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll probably<br/>\n&gt; need to be on crutches to recover and would rather do that pregnant <br/>\n&gt; than with<br/>\n&gt; an infant.  On the other hand, the thought of my wee one getting all <br/>\n&gt; those<br/>\n&gt; drugs in utero is pretty frightening.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s a window between one and two years after surgery that you can <br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; your metal removed, otherwise the bone is too well grown around it.  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to<br/>\n&gt; get the metal out to help with my range of motion. Besides, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; uncomfortable to have all the metal in there, particularly when it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; humid and when you<br/>\n&gt; can no longer sleep on your belly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Baby&#39;s due in January.  Anyone have any experience with surgery during<br/>\n&gt; pregnancy?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Elizabeth<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nHeather, mom to<br/>\nHarriet 12.15.99<br/>\nCrispin 01.25.02<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heatherette@...\">heatherette@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81112,"nextTopicId":81160}}
