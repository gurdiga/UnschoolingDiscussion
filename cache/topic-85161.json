We all get along well and always show up for stuff.<br/>\nMy kids have developed great friends with this group and so have I. We all<br/>\nsee each other twice a week and some of us 3 or even 4 times. We know each<br/>\nother and our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo last park day, while the kids were all building forts in the woods, one<br/>\nmother just point blank asked me how I do it. How do I parent like I do with<br/>\nnever hitting the kids or disciplining them and turn out such great kids? To<br/>\nwhich all the other mothers agreed how great and easy my kids are. Wow!! I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t see that one coming. There was a discussion weeks before with some<br/>\nmoms talking about hitting their kids. My horror wasn&#39;t able to be stifled<br/>\nand the one mom remembered how I felt and that&#39;s why she brought up the<br/>\nsubject. That if I never hit, how do I get the kids to listen and behave?<br/>\n(her words, not mine)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we all talked a lot about parenting and what I do and what I did and what<br/>\nI don&#39;t do. And all but one mom was actually seeing what I was talking<br/>\nabout. She was the one that originally asked the question. So when she asked<br/>\nme specifics, I would give her ideas to which she responded that it would<br/>\nnever work for her girls and that she&#39;s tried everything and nothing works.<br/>\nAnd although she wasn&#39;t seeing help, all the other moms did.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne mom relayed the story just recently where she makes her son clean up all<br/>\nhis toys before he goes to bed. He can chose to not clean them up and she<br/>\nwill, but she bags them all in the trash. When he went to bed crying saying<br/>\nhe didn&#39;t think he wanted to live there anymore, she put him outside in the<br/>\nback yard and told him to go. When he said he would miss his Bionicles, she<br/>\nbagged them up and handed them to him. He walked away crying and she called<br/>\nhim back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked quite awhile with what I thought about that and other ways she<br/>\ncould have handled it and more than that, how the poor little boy must have<br/>\nfelt. How unsafe she made home for him and not at all unconditional. He&#39;s 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe emailed me later that night saying how the one mom asked for advice and<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t even think of taking any of it. She also thanked me for what I said<br/>\nand vowed to never get near that way of thinking and doing again. She felt<br/>\nawful about what she did.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I know I helped at least one little boy that day to have things be a<br/>\nlittle better. I know this mom will try much harder. She always gets such a<br/>\nkick out of my kids asking me for all kinds of things at the playground.<br/>\nLike can I have a drink, some crackers, can I go play, can I play in the<br/>\nwoods, can I go over there? She said she has never heard me say no to them<br/>\nabout anything, yet they keep asking me politely to do things. I guess they<br/>\nhaven&#39;t made the switch yet from mom can I go play in the woods to mom I&#39;m<br/>\ngoing to go and play in the woods. I&#39;m sure they will eventually. In the<br/>\nmeantime, it seems to some I have completely polite and kind children who<br/>\n*must* have tons of rules to follow or else they wouldn&#39;t act like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo my group, they know better. They Joe and I with our kids both out and at<br/>\nhome. They know we don&#39;t have rules and consequences for not following them.<br/>\nThey know we have happy kids who are fun to be around. So maybe we&#39;re<br/>\nhelping more than just one little kid by just being around. I know a few<br/>\nmoms have eased way up on the &quot;school&quot; part of life. One mom is very excited<br/>\nabout unschooling and getting there. It feels good to make a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] unschooling equals no spanking?","postDate":"1069609361","msgId":85215,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2NS4yODM0ZmNiOC4yY2YyNGI5MUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":85214,"nextInTopic":85216,"prevInTime":85214,"nextInTime":85216,"topicId":85161,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/23/03 10:31:49 AM, starsuncloud@netzero.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1777728598\">In a message dated 11/23/03 10:31:49 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I think he&#39;s the most interesting, fun kid, but he really overwhelms some <br/>\nfolks.

My children receive information about their behavior and how it <br/>\naffects<br/>\n others, they get a strong reaction if they try to harm anyone, but <br/>\nnot any kind<br/>\n of physical punishment.

When something goes haywire, there is <br/>\nALWAYS an<br/>\n underlying reason or something I could have done to prevent the <br/>\nproblem.
