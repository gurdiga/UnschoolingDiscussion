So, you<br/>\ncould act out the rules with props (unless it would seem really stupid<br/>\nand babyish to your son).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you might also take every rule and find a street location, not<br/>\ntoo far from your house, where it applies.  Then maybe you could drive<br/>\nthe route and talk about each rule.  Maybe your son could drive the<br/>\nroute and you could tell each rule at the pertinent point.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere also must be curriculum suppliers who sell materials to public<br/>\nschools and public school teachers.  You could maybe find something on<br/>\nthe web that sells driver&#39;s ed materials.  Or perhaps a website that<br/>\nrents videos or DVDs by mail that might have the kind of video you wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":52490229,"authorName":"Leslie Avery","from":"Leslie Avery &lt;ljbakavery@...&gt;","profile":"ljbakavery","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Diet","postDate":"1030647069","msgId":42507,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwODI5MTg1MTA5LjQwNTA3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMGMwMWMyNGY4MyQ2YmZkY2IyMCRlNjg1ZWU0MEBkZWZhdWx0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":42491,"nextInTopic":42549,"prevInTime":42506,"nextInTime":42508,"topicId":42491,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 19 year old son wants to try again to get his permit, but can t learn by reading the book, he is a visual learner.
