Sarah<br/>\n&gt;FREE FLIGHT FOR KIDS<br/>\n&gt;If you have a child age 8-17, you can arrange for them to<br/>\n&gt;have a free demonstration flight on a plane (usually small<br/>\n&gt;personal prop planes). The Young Eagles Program is designed<br/>\n&gt;to introduce young people to aviation. The pilot will<br/>\n&gt;usually talk to the kids about the plane, aeronautical<br/>\n&gt;charts/reference points, preflight inspections, instrument<br/>\n&gt;panels, & the parts of the plane. While the flight is<br/>\n&gt;usually a one day event, there are also summer programs<br/>\n&gt;available at their headquarters. The flights can be found<br/>\n&gt;all over the country.
