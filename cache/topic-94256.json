I am new to this list as of about three<br/>\n&gt; weeks ago. My name <br/>\n&gt; is Linda and I have three really great boys ages 8,<br/>\n&gt; 6, and 3. First <br/>\n&gt; of all, I want to thank everyone, you have already<br/>\n&gt; helped me to make <br/>\n&gt; a choice I was having trouble with.  There is a VERY<br/>\n&gt; Christian hs <br/>\n&gt; group that meets about 5 mins away from my house. <br/>\n&gt; We were new in <br/>\n&gt; town this year and joined.  I learned pretty quickly<br/>\n&gt; that you were <br/>\n&gt; immediatly judged by two questions-Are you Christian<br/>\n&gt; (We actually <br/>\n&gt; had <br/>\n&gt; to sign a belief statement as to whether or not we<br/>\n&gt; were Christian <br/>\n&gt; basically stating anyone who wasn&#39;t went to hell),<br/>\n&gt; and- What church <br/>\n&gt; do you go to.  This was followed by pressure to<br/>\n&gt; attend church, <br/>\n&gt; especailly theirs.  Now, I was raised Catholic and<br/>\n&gt; while I have been <br/>\n&gt; movig away from it towards more open beliefs,<br/>\n&gt; (another good buddist <br/>\n&gt; book that I have been reading is &quot;A Path With Heart&quot;<br/>\n&gt; by Jack <br/>\n&gt; Kornfield) I didn&#39;t think a Christian group would be<br/>\n&gt; a problem.  I <br/>\n&gt; have to say though, these are some of the most<br/>\n&gt; judgemental, clannish <br/>\n&gt; people I have ever met.  I live in a somewhat rural<br/>\n&gt; area of Alaska <br/>\n&gt; and any other group is at least 45 mins away.  (Not<br/>\n&gt; too big a deal <br/>\n&gt; in the summer but winter&#39;s another story!)  Also my<br/>\n&gt; husband and I <br/>\n&gt; share one car so it&#39;s hard sometimes.  But you know<br/>\n&gt; what?  I have <br/>\n&gt; decided I don&#39;t care.  I would rather drive all the<br/>\n&gt; way into town <br/>\n&gt; (even in the dead of winter) than deal with the<br/>\n&gt; negativity and <br/>\n&gt; pressure to be &quot;saved&quot;.  We have joined a playground<br/>\n&gt; group in town <br/>\n&gt; and suprize!  My kids actually have friends, and I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t come home <br/>\n&gt; feeling guilty and annoyed.  Come fall, we will be<br/>\n&gt; attending the <br/>\n&gt; secular group with these people.  It will be worth<br/>\n&gt; it.  Now this may <br/>\n&gt; not seem like a big deal to anyone else, but it was<br/>\n&gt; a hard decision <br/>\n&gt; for me.  Winter in interior Alaska is a challenge<br/>\n&gt; and I&#39;m not the <br/>\n&gt; most confident driver.  Also I worry way too much<br/>\n&gt; what people <br/>\n&gt; think!  Anyway, just wanted to introduce myself and<br/>\n&gt; thank you<br/>\n&gt; (again)  I look foreword to the opportunity to keep<br/>\n&gt; learning and re-<br/>\n&gt; evaluating. <br/>\n&gt;                         Linda <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
