About a year ago she wanted to watch a particular show, a <br/>\ncross between x files and nypdblues with comedy thrown in.  Monsters <br/>\nwere a bit scary, I told her I thought it might be too much for her but <br/>\nshe insisted she was fine.  I said OK.  She was fine for about 2 <br/>\nepisodes, and then the next one she wasn&#39;t fine.  Had nightmares for <br/>\nweeks.  Refused to watch another show.  Swore up and down she&#39;d always <br/>\nlisten to me when I cautioned her.  The monsters lived in the walls of a <br/>\nschool--hmmmm.  Anyway, now when I say &quot;I dont&#39; think this is really <br/>\nappropriate and give her my reasons, she listens, we talk and she makes <br/>\nup her own mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my five year old I&#39;m a little more helpful.  I&#39;ve never said &quot;no, <br/>\nyou can&#39;t watch that.&quot;  I have said &quot;Janene, I think you should wait a <br/>\nfew more years.  It&#39;s a bit scary.&quot;  She has always been OK with that <br/>\nand not really asked to watch anything I said &quot;please wait.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont&#39; censure books either.  I have a huge collection of holocaust <br/>\nbooks.  I simply have asked Lexie to wait a few years on that, telling <br/>\nher the subject matter was pretty difficult and I wanted her to be older <br/>\nbefore reading those books.  She has respected that.<br/>\nI think that&#39;s the key though, I respect her opinions and rights and  <br/>\nhave always talked to her about my decisions and so she respects mine as <br/>\nwell.  Sure, I occassionally loose my temper and have more than I am <br/>\nproud of lost it and grounded her or something but usually after a few <br/>\nhours and we calm down we talk and move on.<br/>\nAbout bedtime.  I do sometimes say &quot;think now, sweetie, maybe you are <br/>\ncrying and in the midst of a meltdown because you are tired or hungry, <br/>\nlet&#39;s see what we can do about that.&quot;  Or &quot;let&#39;s go cuddle together for <br/>\na bit.&quot;  Helping them to see that they are screaming at their sister <br/>\nbecause her shoe was touched and the fact that she is extremely tired <br/>\nmight be related is part of my job.  But both my kids will also say &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\ntired, I&#39;m going to bed.&quot;  No bedtimes, no get up earlies, except for <br/>\nrare occassions.  We eat when we are hungry and sleep when we are tired, <br/>\npee when our bladder is full,and we never ask permission to do any of <br/>\nthose things.<br/>\nThe bath thing is another thing though.  I don&#39;t make them take a bath <br/>\nbut I have said &quot;you won&#39;t be getting into MY bed smelling like that and <br/>\nthat is usually enough to get them to go find some water and soap.<br/>\nJoylyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82369,"nextTopicId":82559}}
