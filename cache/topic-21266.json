When it rains for days, I&#39;ll use the dryer but recently, when the dryer broke during a 5-day rainy period, I just started hanging things all over the house, ie. the bunk bed, door knobs, shower rods.  I told hubby not to bother fixing it, but he&#39;s the fixerupper, so It&#39;s working again.  That breeze is free and fresh and I hate opening that hot dryer or forgetting it and finding everything wrinkled.  Kandi<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nI have not used my dryer for 7 years! I dry the unmentionables (underwear, bras) on a wooden tree in my bedroom.  Everything else goes outside on the line. DH just built me a nice big 50&#39; long laundry line with 4 wires, that&#39;s 200 feet of drying space!  So far, I&#39;ve not had to use all the space, but I most likely will in winter when it takes a longer time to dry clothes.<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   &gt;Does anybody use a clothesline?....for the laundry, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;mean!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!
