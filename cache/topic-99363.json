I have been lurking for quite a while trying to get a feel for the list.  My youngest two children, a ds10 and a dd11 were also adopted at the ages of 6 and 7.  I actually don&#39;t think of them as adopted; I think of them as born from my heart, and that it just took a bit more time than usual for us to find each other.<br/>\n       I&#39;m on this list because I have been home schooling them since the beginning.  My sense was to protect them and provide a safe, loving place for them to heal and to bond with their family. I knew that school would be a cruel place for them.  I also felt that we had so much time to make up for, and I didn&#39;t want to share them for several hours a day with a school system.  These are the things I knew.  However, my &#39;mommy radar&#39; tells me that there is more I can do (or maybe stop doing:0), that there is something about this whole &#39;me being in charge of the schooling thing&#39; that isn&#39;t quite a fit.  Hence I sought and found this list and I am learning.  I can&#39;t help but think of something I heard Maya Angelou say once...I&#39;m paraphrasing...&#39;I did the best I knew to do, but when I knew better, I did better.&#39;  I&#39;m seeking a way to bring my children into an even stronger place.<br/>\n  <br/>\nI think I&#39;ve found the sort of village that I need that may not mind helping us sort out all the healing, learning, growing, or whatever comes by.  I&#39;ve got a lot of unschooling to do, miles of head tape to erase, and two beautiful children that are worth all the effort.  So I&#39;m going to keep listening, but I also realize that it might be nice to chime in from time to time.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnn<br/>\n <br/>\nAnn <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CelticFrau@...\">CelticFrau@...</a> wrote:<br/>\nWe have an adopted son, who had some major attachment problems because of <br/>\nneglect, then being put in foster care and many different homes between ages 3 <br/>\nand 7, and we CANNOT joke with him about anything that is remotely personal.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBless his heart, he takes it all seriously, personally, doesn&#39;t laugh or if <br/>\nhe does, you can see it hurts him (noticed many times when it came from someone <br/>\noutside our family.)
