And in the case of unschooling it isn&#39;t  <br/>\nat all true.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith unschooling, the primary goal is living a joyful life in an  <br/>\nenvironment that&#39;s loving and supportive of who a child is.  <br/>\nUnschoolers *know* that by pursuing that goal, reading (and other  <br/>\nlearning) will happen as a side effect. But since we aren&#39;t actively  <br/>\nworking towards reading or math or science or getting into college,  <br/>\nit seems like we don&#39;t care if those things happen or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all want our kids to learn how to speak. And yet when our kids are  <br/>\ninfants and toddlers we aren&#39;t consciously pursuing the goal of  <br/>\ngetting them to speak! We&#39;re confident that as long as we&#39;re living  <br/>\nlife with them they&#39;ll speak. It&#39;s just a natural part of getting  <br/>\nolder for kids and we don&#39;t even need to think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that mean we don&#39;t care if they speak or not?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, it just means we know that speaking happens as a natural side  <br/>\neffect of living life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s how unschooling works. It&#39;s about being confident that  <br/>\nlearning happens as a side effect of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s not all. Like learning to speak, learning in general  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t happen in a vacuum. If we don&#39;t speak to infants and toddlers  <br/>\nthey&#39;re not going to learn how to speak. If we don&#39;t create an  <br/>\n&quot;unschooling environment&quot;, kids&#39; learning is going to be limited.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is an unschooling environment?<br/>\n<br/>\nI like Deb&#39;s quote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Unschooling works well when parents understand learning is natural and<br/>\n&gt; does not need to be forced.  Unschooling works well when children are<br/>\n&gt; respected.   Unschooling works well when parents are generous with  <br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; time, love, attention, possessions and money.  Unschooling works well<br/>\n&gt; when parents are interesting, positive, thoughtful, considerate,<br/>\n&gt; generous, passionate, honest, respectful individuals.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would add in curious about the world since that will help parents  <br/>\nnaturally bring the world to their children just because they think  <br/>\nit&#39;s interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I would also point out that thoughtful is a part of attention.  <br/>\nThinking about them and pointing out or bringing home something they  <br/>\nmight like, helping them further explore what they&#39;re actions say  <br/>\ninterests them (which -- in addition to the interests like astronomy  <br/>\nand analytical calculus that we might be looking for if we&#39;re still  <br/>\nstuck in school mode -- might be comedy movies or video games or ATVs  <br/>\nor ...)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109551,"nextTopicId":109563}}
