And in the past few weeks we&#39;ve  watched<br/>\n&gt;some big changes in him, and most of them are a result of unschooling. I<br/>\n&gt;thought I&#39;d share.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Julian was just hired for his first real job. Not at McDonald&#39;s or at a  g<br/>\n&gt;rocery store, but instead he was hired as the Coordinator of Religious  <br/>\n&gt;Education<br/>\n&gt;in the Salem, MA Unitarian Universalist church where he grew  up -- a job<br/>\n&gt;that I held several years ago. (I am the Director of Religious  Education <br/>\n&gt;in the<br/>\n&gt;Wakefield UU church, so we are now colleagues.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s a complex job, requiring a lot of organization, working with both kids<br/>\n&gt;and adults, multiple meetings, public speaking, etc. Churches usually hire<br/>\n&gt;people who are not only adults, but also college graduates for this <br/>\n&gt;position.<br/>\n&gt;Julian, with some help, wrote a great resume and cover letter. We prepped <br/>\n&gt;him<br/>\n&gt;for the interview.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But it was really all him. Julian expresses himself in a way that is more<br/>\n&gt;calm and mature than most adults I know.

He&#39;s just become remarkably more grown-up. Part of it is<br/>\n&gt;little things, being more focused and attentive to things around him. Part <br/>\n&gt;of  him<br/>\n&gt;seems more serious, but as big a part is that he seems to have lightened up<br/>\n&gt;a little. To quote the wise Julian, he is awesome. It&#39;s becoming clear what<br/>\n&gt;kind  of man he will be: smart, funny, kind, responsible, thoughtful, <br/>\n&gt;talented.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Loud, discordant music still plays and there are still piles of dirty  <br/>\n&gt;socks.<br/>\n&gt;But I&#39;m kind of liking that, because the little boy doesn&#39;t really live  <br/>\n&gt;here<br/>\n&gt;anymore.
