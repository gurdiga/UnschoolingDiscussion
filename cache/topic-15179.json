He loves to <br/>\ntell me he is going to wait till he is 14 to read. I just smile. It is <br/>\namazing to me how much reading type activities actually take place during <br/>\nthe day. My son checked out all 4 unabridged audio books of the Harry Potter <br/>\nseries and sat through them several times. My older son, 11 who is almost an <br/>\nobsessive reader (I have to tell him not to take books when we go on bike <br/>\nrides.) got the harry Potter trivia game for Christmas. My 7 year old wins <br/>\nthe game almost every time. This really helped me relax about my son not <br/>\nreading.

I do that myself.  I<br/>\n&gt;do not feel like I am pushing them as much as exposing them.  For example,<br/>\n&gt;last summer I signed our son up for tennis with the National Junior Tennis<br/>\n&gt;League.  The classes were dead cheap ($15 per session each session was<br/>\n&gt;three weeks long two hours a day m-w-f).

But you know what, after that first<br/>\n&gt;class, he LOVED it.  He ended up taking all three summer sessions (nine<br/>\n&gt;weeks of tennis for $45 is a GREAT price, if you have this program in your<br/>\n&gt;area, check it out!).  If he had not loved it, I would not have made him<br/>\n&gt;stay.

He will probably never play competitively<br/>\n&gt;(nor do I want him to), but now he has something he enjoys, and may never<br/>\n&gt;have known if I had not nudged him.  Now, I did give him full freedom of<br/>\n&gt;going or not going to the classes.<br/>\n&gt;I really wanted him to enjoy it, not feel forced into it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On the opposite side, he had wanted to take Tae Kwon Do, so we arranged to<br/>\n&gt;go with a homeschooling friend to one of her TKD classes.  He got in there<br/>\n&gt;and HATED it.    He did the same with soccer.  He wanted to play soccer, so<br/>\n&gt;I signed him up, paid the $70 to have him go to one 45 minute practice and<br/>\n&gt;one game a week for 6 weeks.  By the third week he was HATING it.
