I thought I&#39;d add what <br/>\nhappened today.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuncan and I were watching Jesus Christ Superstar today. I had gotten the <br/>\nsoundtrack from the library last week. We&#39;d listened to it in the car. He LOVES <br/>\nHerod&#39;s bit. I mentioned that it was a movie, so he asked that we get the movie <br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had a BUNCH of questions about the story (we&#39;re atheists, so he&#39;s not <br/>\nlearning this stuff in Sunday school), and I was explaining what was happening. <br/>\nThe soundtrack started the conversation about the flogging. When the scene <br/>\napproached in the movie, he asked to leave the room---he didn&#39;t want to see Jesus <br/>\nwhipped. Instead, I fast forwarded through it. He happily watched the rest of <br/>\nthe movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe will probably eventually want to see the flogging scene, but he KNEW he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t ready for it yet. We discussed that Ted Neely is an actor, that they <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t actually injure their actor, that Judas wasn&#39;t really hanged (seeing him <br/>\nstep back on the bus was reassuring &lt;g&gt;), and that being aware of what you can <br/>\npersonally handle is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nHerod is his favorite character----but he likes Judas&#39;s music and songs the <br/>\nbest.
