If they move or even if <br/>\nthe child dies, they STILL must pay, unless they&#39;ve purchased insurance. <br/>\nThat&#39;s about $300/year where we were. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51076,"nextTopicId":51080}}
