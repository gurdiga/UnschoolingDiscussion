When he said that he took off because you were too<br/>\nstrict about cleaning up, what do you suppose he meant? To some<br/>\npeople, it might seem like a silly reason, but does that stand in for<br/>\nhim saying that he doesn&#39;t trust you to care about him, unless he<br/>\npicks up after himself, that your love is conditional? Might there be<br/>\nsomething else in that statement about strict cleaning rules that a 13<br/>\nyear old boy has a hard time articulating?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he is relating to you and your husband by lying and stealing, its<br/>\npossible that this is not a reflection on you, or on him, but is a<br/>\nsymptom of the damage that has been done to him in school, and in<br/>\nother places, because he is a child, because he is black and almost a<br/>\nman. Bravado, tuning you out, lying and stealing that test your<br/>\ncommitment to him, to me these sound like the actions of a boy trying<br/>\ndesperately to protect himself. Maybe the best question for you is,<br/>\nhow can you help him to a) protect himself from the damage that is<br/>\nstill being done to him, and then b) help him to make himself whole<br/>\nand confident. It might help to talk to him, without a tone of voice<br/>\nthat says &quot;lecture&quot;, about your concerns. Not that you want him to<br/>\n&quot;stay out of trouble&quot;, he&#39;s probably heard that one before, but that<br/>\nyou want him to be whole, that you want him to excel, and that you<br/>\nwant him to be self-confident. One of the tricks that has worked very<br/>\nwell for me in relating to my kids (and to all small humans) is<br/>\ntreating them and talking to them as though they were friends, about<br/>\nwhom I care very deeply. With the same tone of respect that I would<br/>\nuse with a friend I was concerned about. I wouldn&#39;t tell her what to<br/>\ndo or what not to do, I would tell her how much I care, and why I am<br/>\nconcerned.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is very capable, right now. He may not read well, but he is able to<br/>\nget by, this takes a lot of skill. If you convince yourself that he is<br/>\ncapable, this will affect the way you treat him, and he will notice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, you can still strew things in his path that he<br/>\n*might* find interesting. (Recognizing that he also might not pick<br/>\nthem up, and that&#39;s okay). What about hiphop comics like Blokhedz, cds<br/>\nof rap artists that he hasn&#39;t heard before, who are doing innovative<br/>\nthings with rhythym, rhyme, lyrics, social critique. Do you have<br/>\npercussion instruments in the house, or could you get some?<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck,<br/>\n<br/>\nGwen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"Deb Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Unmotivated-again and lastly","postDate":"1114188882","msgId":105554,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwNDIyLjEwNTQ0Mi4yMjcyLjEuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":105553,"nextInTopic":105556,"prevInTime":105553,"nextInTime":105556,"topicId":105541,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Firstly, I m in to rap/hip-hop, so its not the music, its the idea that you can get money and cars and the vanity this shows. *** Do you mean that you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-841597257\">***Firstly, I&#39;m in to rap/hip-hop, so its not the music, its the idea <br/>\nthat you can get money and cars and the vanity this shows. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you mean that you believe he is interested in rap because rap videos<br/>\nshow lavish characters and lifestyles and you are afraid or you believe<br/>\nhe will be wrongly motivated by them?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are concerned for his education because you want him to be more than<br/>\na functioning illiterate.  To what end?<br/>\nWhen he is educated do you expect him to be able to hold down a job so<br/>\nthat he can have some quality of life?  <br/>\nIn your opinion does a quality life *not* include money and cars?  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I think a troubled fourteen year old has every right, and indeed<br/>\nis demonstrating a healthy human quality when he dreams that his life can<br/>\nbe better.   If he can only think of a better life as a life with cars<br/>\nand money, I would say that is directly because he is not experiencing<br/>\npersonally those things which we all know *really* make life better,<br/>\nrespect, acceptance, love, generosity, kindness.  (chocolate)  <br/>\n <br/>\n***James will focus on what he needs to do. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier you said he lacks focus.   Can you tell us which it is?  Do you<br/>\nmean by the sheer force of your will you will *make* James focus whether<br/>\nhe feels focused or not?  <br/>\n<br/>\n***What he has to do is utilize life and learning in a way that he can<br/>\nunderstand and like***<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, he doesn&#39;t &quot;have&quot; to.  James *could* leave you and never come back.  <br/>\nA young girl here killed herself last year.  She was younger than James<br/>\nand facing many of the same issues as you describe.  She didn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot;<br/>\ndo anything after that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you mean you would like for James to be able to find a good life? <br/>\nDoes it have to be on your terms only?<br/>\n<br/>\n***I think he should be straightforward and honorable and there is<br/>\nnothing wrong with that. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople are honorable when they&#39;re treated honorably.  Who has honored<br/>\nJames?  One moment won&#39;t be enough to show him the value of honor.  It<br/>\ntakes a lifetime.  In his fourteen years how many people have honored<br/>\nhim?  It can begin with having real consideration for the things he<br/>\nloves.  By helping him do those things and have exposure to those things<br/>\nand by engaging him about those things. <br/>\n<br/>\n***And, if taking away some &quot;fun&quot; is mean, oh <br/>\nwell, better that than him selling drugs, being on drugs, or in jail <br/>\nbecause we didn&#39;t discipline/limit instant gratification. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nDeprivation doesn&#39;t make a person reasonable, it makes them starved and<br/>\ndesperate.  Desperate people do desperate things.   If his mind is filled<br/>\nwith negativity and hopelessness he will act like a negative and hopeless<br/>\nperson.  When he&#39;s filled up with positive regard and given hope he will<br/>\nbegin to be a positive and hopeful person.  That&#39;s the only way it can<br/>\nhappen.  His life has to become good and worthwhile right now if you want<br/>\nto see him find goodness within himself. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think unschooling could be the most hopeful path for James but you have<br/>\nto want the most hopeful path for James too.   If all these years in<br/>\nschool and all the pushing has not led him to the ability to do academic<br/>\nthings, you might think about whether  that approach can lead anywhere<br/>\npositive.   Leave it behind.  My son learned to read by doing the things<br/>\nhe loved, not by having reading lessons.   Lot&#39;s of unschooled kids read<br/>\nlater, and if James can unschool he will not be &quot;behind&quot; he will be right<br/>\non schedule for James.   He&#39;s so young.  You have so much time, but if<br/>\nyou waste it by imposing on him all the terrible things his former life<br/>\nimposed you won&#39;t help him. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a very good and noble thing that you&#39;ve taken him and his brothers<br/>\nand are trying to give them a better life.  Take an example from his<br/>\npast, his schooling, and live a better example.   You&#39;re posts are filled<br/>\nwith negative things about him and we can understand that he&#39;s had a hard<br/>\ntime.   Could you write a post about all the positive things you can see<br/>\nin him?  Write about his interest in music - don&#39;t post one negative<br/>\nthing at all - and then let some of the people here expound on ways those<br/>\ninterests of his can become the biggest most positive forces in his<br/>\nlife,(with your help)  big enough to replace the negative realities he&#39;s<br/>\nlived with until now.   This could be a really healing thing for you,<br/>\nseeing as you must have and must be facing some really big challenges<br/>\nnow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109733800,"authorName":"Latoya","from":"&quot;Latoya&quot; &lt;latoyadenise@...&gt;","profile":"latoyadenise","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Unmotivated-again and lastly","postDate":"1114186832","msgId":105553,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ0Yjg4ZytqYWRmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUzLjI2MjA4Nzk1LjJmOWE3NzQ3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":105552,"nextInTopic":105554,"prevInTime":105552,"nextInTime":105554,"topicId":105541,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra, I wasn t referring to learning when I said this.

Drumming, music, it doesn&#39;t matter what he&#39;s interested <br/>\nin if he&#39;s not confident in his own skills and ability to do those <br/>\nthings.

So pushing him hard to learn is not the problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have no idea what I have to say about his brothers or my <br/>\ndaughter because I haven&#39;t posted about them.

Otherwise, he&#39;s likely to expend all his energy rebelling against those who&#39;ve deemed his interests and passions unacceptable. <br/>\n <br/>\n****<br/>\n <br/>\nThe year hasn&#39;t gotten underway as in this is just April, the 4th <br/>\nmonth of the year. <br/>\n <br/>\n****<br/>\nUsing this standard, with a lifespan of 80 yrs, the average person&#39;s life really isn&#39;t &#39;underway&#39; until he&#39;s 25. Why push him so hard now?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think he should be straightforward and honorable and there is <br/>\nnothing wrong with that. And, if taking away some &quot;fun&quot; is mean, oh <br/>\nwell, better that than him selling drugs, being on drugs, or in jail <br/>\n <br/>\n*****<br/>\n <br/>\nPeople can&#39;t be forced to become honorable or straightforward.  You can, perhaps, force them to be compliant, but honor results from feeling respected and trusted. If you can&#39;t extend trust to him, he&#39;s not likely to develop honor while living in you home.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nI already know he will not be an unschooled child <br/>\nfor at least a year or so. Allowing him to take it upon himself to <br/>\nbe interested will be us in this same spot next year about this time and that is not acceptable and that&#39;s the reality. I look forward to keeping everyone updated on our progress. <br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\n <br/>\nYou can predict the future, too?  How sad for James that even his rescuer thinks he&#39;s incapable of making any progress without coercion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is it about James that you&#39;ve cast him as the one incapable of goodness and progress?  You seem to feel his brothers are capable and good, but you&#39;ve already written James off.  Does your paradigm require a bad child to make the others look good?<br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

Me referring to him as student is<br/>\n&gt; just <br/>\n&gt; that and nothing more.

When I opened myself<br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; him and was ready to go out/stay in and learn, he definitely used<br/>\n&gt; that <br/>\n&gt; to his advantage.

Otherwise, when trying to talk to him he <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t appear confident (understandably) and clams up and doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; talk at all. Some have asked if he&#39;s mentally challenged. The only <br/>\n&gt; person I&#39;ve heard him talk to is one of his 2 brothers that are here <br/>\n&gt; they are pretty close. His non-verbal interests are obviously ones <br/>\n&gt; that will get him in some deep trouble and we can aide in steering <br/>\n&gt; away from those things and more toward the drumming, rap/hip-hop<br/>\n&gt; which <br/>\n&gt; can be composed and created and sold - things of which we can assist <br/>\n&gt; him with. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think he should be straightforward and honorable and there is <br/>\n&gt; nothing wrong with that.
