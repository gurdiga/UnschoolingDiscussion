If I thought she wouldn&#39;t wake<br/>\nup, I&#39;d get up earlier than her.  My nearly-4yo (next month...)  gets up<br/>\nmost mornings about half-an-hour before the rest of us and mooches about,<br/>\nwatching tv or &#39;reading&#39; then I get up with dd2, and dh gets up much later.<br/>\nAt this age, it&#39;s difficult to expect the girls not to jump on the bed when<br/>\nDaddy&#39;s resting, and that causes some friction.  As does dh&#39;s penchant for<br/>\nevening &#39;naps,&#39; especially when I don&#39;t know he&#39;s taking them and I&#39;m having<br/>\nsome &#39;puter time, ie kids get left in front of a video or Tom and Jerry or<br/>\nsummat (grrrrrr!)<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you get him to wake up earlier from his nap, as oppose to not napping at<br/>\nall?  If I got up at 6am I think I&#39;d want a nap!  (I did today, and I got up<br/>\nat 8.30am!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH<br/>\nTracy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3125,"nextTopicId":3127}}
