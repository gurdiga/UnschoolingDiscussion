I myself <br/>\nhave only known in real life, not internet relationships,a couple <br/>\nself-proclaimed Christians, who do see other POV&#39;s without openly judging. Sometimes it <br/>\nstarts a dialogue and we get to see where one-another is coming from. I too, <br/>\nhave friends like Joyce was saying, who just automatically assume I&#39;m a <br/>\nChristian. Why do I bother to correct anyone, sometimes they need to know and sometimes <br/>\nthey don&#39;t. I also have chosen to not correct the assumption when I know that <br/>\nmy POV would probably strain the relationship. When it comes to Kass and <br/>\nKree, they have gained that skill already, just by noticing that depending on the <br/>\ncompany we are in there are certain religious topics I only discuss to certain <br/>\nextents. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich brings me to another observation. A few months back Kass and Kree and I <br/>\nwere listening to one of our most favored punk bands. We were discussing the <br/>\nlyrics of a song and Kree said, &quot;But they are Christian mom.&quot; I responded <br/>\nwith, &quot;OK and what does that mean? Does it change how you perceive their music?&quot;<br/>\nShe said, &quot;No, I was just telling you.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThat brought on a wonderful in the car discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went on to discuss how religions are often used as shields. Either to wage <br/>\nwars on non-believers (regardless of what religion a person may follow) or to <br/>\nprotect ones self from the possibility of other POV&#39;s. Then we talked about <br/>\nwhy some people have faith and why some don&#39;t. Then why it&#39;s OK to have friends <br/>\nand family with differing belief systms. We also talked about actions <br/>\nspeaking louder than titles or declarations. For me, that is how I discern or judge. <br/>\nIt was a very exhilirating conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda - off to take Kree to the orthodontist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"starsuncloud@netzero.net","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Christians","postDate":"1056466789","msgId":75326,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwNjI0LjExMDAzOS4xNjQ1LjU5OTk1OEB3ZWJtYWlsMDQubnljLnVudGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":75329,"prevInTime":75325,"nextInTime":75327,"topicId":75326,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... accept ...
