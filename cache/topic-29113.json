Just when I mentioned here that I avoid debates among my h&#39;school friends, I had to eat my words yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a new mom in the group, we were all introducing ourselves. She was getting intimate, asking us how we implement our homeschooling (curriculums or not, etc.) and I mumbled that I&#39;m trying unschooling which is far away from curriculums.<br/>\nAll at once, everyone&#39;s ears perked up as if I had mentioned gold or something. I was bombarded with questions from about 4 different mom&#39;s asking what unschooling was all about and what it means exactly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was spouting off all I could remember from reading everything that I had for the past few months. It was almost like a test! But they all seemed very interested and kept asking more questions, and did not belittle me, most importantly. I was ecstatic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t expect that this scenario will be repeated each time I talk about unschooling. In fact, other homeschoolers from our group may seek me out now and confront me about unschooling. I know it won&#39;t go over very well with a few, in particular.

I was bombarded with questions from about 4 different mom&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; asking what unschooling was all about and what it means exactly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was spouting off all I could remember from reading everything that I <br/>\n&gt; had for the past few months. It was almost like a test! But they all <br/>\n&gt; seemed very interested and kept asking more questions, and did not <br/>\n&gt; belittle me, most importantly. I was ecstatic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t expect that this scenario will be repeated each time I talk <br/>\n&gt; about unschooling. In fact, other homeschoolers from our group may seek <br/>\n&gt; me out now and confront me about unschooling. I know it won&#39;t go over <br/>\n&gt; very well with a few, in particular. But I&#39;m happy that I at least had <br/>\n&gt; this one boost of confidence concerning my recent decision to unschool. <br/>\n&gt; Hopefully there will be more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just needed to share this experience - with someone!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Karin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Joseph Fuerst<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, November 29, 2001 8:43 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1640<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Karin:<br/>\n&gt;   I know what you mean about avoiding debates.  I&#39;m feeling more and <br/>\n&gt; more sure<br/>\n&gt;   as I go along.....it&#39;s generally my way to be gentle,  but I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; sometimes so<br/>\n&gt;   much so that I fail to get my point across.  I&#39;m better at it in <br/>\n&gt; writing,<br/>\n&gt;   but I really want to be able to challenge people - in a kind way- to <br/>\n&gt; look at<br/>\n&gt;   things with their children differently.<br/>\n&gt;   I recently re-united with an old college pal who just started <br/>\n&gt; hs-ing.  She<br/>\n&gt;   has set up a little &#39;school room&#39; in her house - I hope she&#39;ll <br/>\n&gt; outgrow it!<br/>\n&gt;   I don&#39;t want to be too forward about unschooling and scare her off,  <br/>\n&gt; yet I<br/>\n&gt;   adore her youngsters and hope she&#39;ll loosen up as she goes.<br/>\n&gt;   My other friend from childhood would be apalled at unschooling,  I <br/>\n&gt; think.<br/>\n&gt;   And what&#39;s interesting to me is that I was much more &#39;academically&#39;<br/>\n&gt;   intelligent than she.....I think there&#39;s some kind of fear there...<br/>\n&gt;   gotta go for now,<br/>\n&gt;   Susan,  often a &#39;closet unschooler&#39;  among hs groups!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I only have homeschooling friends, no unschoolers yet, except here and<br/>\n&gt;   unschooling.com. (thankful for that)<br/>\n&gt;   I am still pretty quiet about my unschooling ways, I&#39;m still to new <br/>\n&gt; to get<br/>\n&gt;   into any debates about it :-)<br/>\n&gt;   But I know people who also seem to go way overboard with the <br/>\n&gt; school-at-home<br/>\n&gt;   thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Karin and Susan,<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could be more like you guys.  Unfortunately, I am different.  <br/>\nI&#39;m sure you&#39;re just as enthusiastic about unschooling as I am, but  I <br/>\nalways want to share what I have learned and know about unschooling.   <br/>\nAt times, I get very excited and can overwhelm some people.  I know I am <br/>\nalso guilty of offending people in the past.  I am trying to learn to <br/>\nkeep my big mouth shut and allow people to discover unschooling on their <br/>\nown.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny thing is that I used to be so quiet, shy and never had an <br/>\nopinion about anything.  I was a real wallflower.  Now, I find I am very <br/>\nopinionated about so many issues and find it hard not to be outspoken.  <br/>\nI need to learn how to be more genteel.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt;   Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
