Reading<br/>\nhis books changed my whole outlook on food and what my body needs as an<br/>\nanimals.  I grew up as practically a vegetarian and as an adult ate many<br/>\nyears as a vegan and later I was into a macrobiotic diet.  I totally<br/>\navoided meat.  I was also, for years, anemic (sp?) and could hardly ever<br/>\ndonate blood or plateletts, which was important to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n After reading Atkins and after over 40 years of being primarily<br/>\nvegetarian and eating very little meat or dairy, I have made a complete<br/>\nturnaround.  I now concentrate on the proteins and avoid many of the<br/>\ncarbohydrates.  Especially, the pastas, potatoes, rice and beans which I<br/>\nloved.  I now eat lots of eggs and don&#39;t limit my consumption of meats<br/>\nat all.  I allow myself most of the veggies except stuff like corn and<br/>\npeas.  I eat lots of salad and other veggies like broccolli and<br/>\nspinach.  I also avoid fruits.  I also take supplement vitamins and<br/>\nminerals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that this new diet works very well for me.  I feel much<br/>\nstronger.  I swim faster and I am no longer anemic.  I can now donate<br/>\nplateletts every week.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I had read Atkins years ago.  He&#39;s been around since the 70&#39;s,<br/>\nyou know.

It could help <br/>\nto read what McDougall and others say on the subject of <br/>\nhunger, diets and ketosis. He is not the final word, but he makes a lot <br/>\nof sense. My point is research alot, not just the person who is selling <br/>\nyou the diet. You don&#39;t want to damage your body <br/>\nor self image based on claims of a miracle cure from someone who&#39;s <br/>\ntrying to make money off of you. Alot of times ordinary people will <br/>\neven recommend a diet that didn&#39;t work for them, <br/>\nbecause they want to justify their choice. They still want to believe <br/>\nthat the diet is a miracle, and it only might not have worked this time <br/>\nfor them because they weren&#39;t strong enough to stay <br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiets that are wacky just don&#39;t work in the long run. They set you up, <br/>\nand blame you for failure. Wacky as in starvation levels of calories, <br/>\nstrict portion controls, or anything that drives you <br/>\nnuts to stay on it so that you go off it and gain more back. To be a <br/>\nreal change for life it has to be sustainable and make you feel better <br/>\nto be on it than off.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who sell diets/books/pills/programs make tons of money from our <br/>\nbelief that if only we were stronger the diets would work. That it&#39;s <br/>\nalways our fault. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it could help to do your own research on nutrition. On what <br/>\nelements the body needs to run and what sugar/caffeine/refined flours <br/>\nand other common foods do to your metabolism. <br/>\nSome people are affected more than others. Mostly it&#39;s an energy roller <br/>\ncoaster though and best to stay off. The real fuel for our bodies seems <br/>\nto be some protein (but not excessive amounts <br/>\nthat your body/kidneys has to work overtime to flush out of your system <br/>\ntaking calcium and other nutrients with it.), plenty of water (for your <br/>\nlungs, blood, brain, and digestion), maybe <br/>\nsome added fats (that&#39;s debated alot), and mostly Complex Carbohydrates <br/>\nsuch as: <br/>\n<br/>\nVegetables, fruit (some people do better with little or no fruit for <br/>\nmany reasons), Super Vegetables (like broccoli that has calcium and <br/>\nvitamin C, cabbage, cauliflower), and the Color <br/>\nVegetables (dark green leafy, and dark orange or yellow like squash and <br/>\nyams). Protein can be found plenty in plant sources, and doesn&#39;t <br/>\novertax the body with all the baggage of meat <br/>\n(cholesterol, fat, hormones, antibiotics, guilt). Whole grains are <br/>\nimportant foods too, and potatoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople don&#39;t really make alot of money telling people to go vegan. It&#39;s <br/>\njust not glamorous or marketable. There are no flashy charts, systems, <br/>\nspecial packages, or pills. It&#39;s just basic <br/>\nnutrition. People want a new idea, some miracle science cure pill. The <br/>\neasy part is you can eat whenever you want, as much as you want to <br/>\nsatisfaction, lose weight, and feel great.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo try going vegan for a few months. Get rid of sugar and flour also if <br/>\nyou want to lose the extra pounds. Your body, pocket book, and the <br/>\nenvironment will be better off for the change.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy B.<br/>\neasier said than done, in a society of omnivores, sugar junkies, and <br/>\ndiet police.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., meghan anderson &lt;moonmeghan@y...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Okay, I&#39;m probably going to feel like a dimwit here,<br/>\n&gt; but what is &#39;ketosis&#39;?

I<br/>\nsaid it as I was stroking the freezer.  From that day on, it has been my<br/>\nfavorite food (coffee ice cream, especially).  For decades, it could not<br/>\nbe in the freezer without me gobbling it up.  Not a day would go by<br/>\nwithout me eating a BIG bowl after dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the last 10 years, I have found that, with just a little bit of<br/>\nwill-power, if I don&#39;t eat any ice cream for 3 or 4 days (that&#39;s all it<br/>\ntakes), I stop craving it.  I am even able to keep it in the freezer and<br/>\ndish it out to my children without taking a taste - and somehow, it&#39;s<br/>\nnot that hard to do.  I&#39;m very proud of myself.  I believe sugar is<br/>\ntruly addictive, but in my personal case, it doesn&#39;t take long to break<br/>\nthat addiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Milanos, candy, cheesecake, chocolate chunk brownies.

I know everyone&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; different, and that their reasons for being attracted to certain foods<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; may be different, but the idea of some foods being &quot;just foods&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; others being &quot;eat all up right away/in a few days&quot; is driving me nuts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you buy those things all the time, or do you limit when you buy<br/>\n&gt; them? I mean any food that you can gobble right down. If I buy them<br/>\n&gt; (candy/cookies/cake/whatever) we eat them all up right away within a<br/>\n&gt; couple of days to the exclusion of healthier foods.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you buy them once in a while, or hardly ever, or do you even think<br/>\n&gt; about them in the store?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I sound obsessed with food, and right now I am. I am trying so hard to<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; figure out healthy things to eat to get my life back. I have been free<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; of most junk for a few days now, and feel alot better, but I still<br/>\n&gt; would eat junk before I would eat the healthy stuff if it was in the<br/>\n&gt; house. These foods are not the total cause of obesity, but they are a<br/>\n&gt; big part of eating beyond normal satisfaction for me and many others.<br/>\n&gt; Eating even when you&#39;re not hungry. Somehow they bypass the normal<br/>\n&gt; appetite regulation system, and you eat more than your body needs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think my food was a problem when I was growing up. We didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; restrict foods that I can remember. I had no desire to rebel growing<br/>\n&gt; up<br/>\n&gt; because I really liked my parents. I felt like they were fair and<br/>\n&gt; always treated me like a person. We had junk around the house<br/>\n&gt; sometimes<br/>\n&gt; and it never lasted long. My dad could let a candy bar get dusty, but<br/>\n&gt; mom and I finished ours on the way home from the store.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I want to balance out my brain chemistry so I can let the candy bar<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; dusty.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kathy B.<br/>\n&gt; ps-I read part of an interesting book about the similarities between<br/>\n&gt; addictions (there&#39;s that word again) to food, alcohol, and drugs, and<br/>\n&gt; the links to certain levels of seratonin (the feel good chemical) in<br/>\n&gt; the brain.

Can I set the time she goes in?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I never have. She goes to bed when she&#39;s tired, just like the rest of us<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do. We&#39;re probably one of the few families in America who have never had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a fight over bedtime...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We don&#39;t generally fight about it either.  She gets to read or play in bed<br/>\n&gt; and she often falls asleep doing so.  At our house though some of us don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; go to bed when we are tired....we stay up on the computer or reading or<br/>\n&gt; watching TV &lt;gasp, smile&gt; and need someone to urge us into bed.  If she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; really into something and wants to, she can stay up a little longer and we<br/>\n&gt; just turn off the light at the same time...so it&#39;s like trading the in bed<br/>\n&gt; reading/playing time for whatever she was doing.  Probably more parental<br/>\n&gt; involvement here on our part than some of you.  (but, that&#39;s OK I tell the<br/>\n&gt; woman in the mirror, smile)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;And<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chores, you say no to those too...so after dinner, when my child<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; asks to beexcused &lt;gasp!  still unlearning, still deciding what of all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll take and what I&#39;ll leave, but yes I did say &quot;asks to be excused&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gasp<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; again!&gt; and I say &quot;sure, please take your dishes in to the kitchen&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; , it&#39;s a &#39;bad&#39; thing?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Neither of us ask to be excused, we might say &quot;excuse me&quot;. OTOH, I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; asked her to bring her dishes into the kitchen, or to make a &quot;dish run&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and round up any other dishes left in the living room, or carry a basket<br/>\n&gt; &gt; full of laundry to the bedroom since she&#39;s going there... and she rarely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; says no and if so, there&#39;s a good reason. I think the key is ask,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; though... she certainly could say no, but she doesn&#39;t... we&#39;re just used<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to working together and helping each other.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yep, it&#39;s a request, and she does once in a while say, &#39;no thank you&#39;, but<br/>\n&gt; she usually does bring them in.  The asking to leave the table thing...oh,<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s just so bred into us!  Hmmmm....I&#39;ll think on letting that go...<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s only instituted during dinner...other meals/snacks she can generally<br/>\n&gt; come and go as she pleases....hmmmm....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I had a miscarriage in 99, my DD was 1 1/2.  In the aftermath of  that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; event<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she watched LOTS more tv (videos, we don&#39;t have cable) than ever<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before...she&#39;d watch a couple of hours a day, as opposed to a half<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hour<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; every couple of days.  I noticed a HUGE decline in her ability to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; engage in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; activities herself.  She had never before been &#39;bored&#39; and now she&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; &gt; walk<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; around the house, see nothing that interested her and ask to watch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tv.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do you think that that might have had more to do with your being in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; state of grief and perhaps less available than formerly? Ah, wait, I see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that you dismiss this idea farther down - but why?  It makes a lot of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sense to me. It could also be part of the process of learning to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; self-regulate, like when kids who have never been allowed to eat more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than one piece of candy are suddenly able to eat all they want, they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; often stuff themselves silly, since that&#39;s what everyone has expected<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that they will do all of their lives if they were given that freedom.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Freedom often takes some getting used to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes.

But, it was a very interesting time...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It also sounds like pretty typical 1 1/2 yr old developmental stuff,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; especially is you were starting to expect her to do chores at that age.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; :-/<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh!

Yes, yes, yes...there could have been other<br/>\n&gt; influences, coincidentally occuring at the same time....  But, don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt; she had a chore list and I was freaking out because she wasn&#39;t doing them<br/>\n&gt; while saying &quot;Yes, m&#39;am&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And you never ask your kids to pick  up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their mess or are you talking only about their rooms?

So I<br/>\n&gt; started to look at various things at our house and how we did things.  Why<br/>\n&gt; did I have a time limit on television?  Would my kids just sit in front of<br/>\n&gt; the television all day, even when I had other interesting things available<br/>\n&gt; for them?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Did I have to deny my kids soda?  Or by talking with them about healthy<br/>\n&gt; choices, about how there is 7 of us and we need to share, would they not<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hog<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; down a 3 liter bottle?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Was it necessary that the 3 yo clean up their mess alone whenever I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>decided<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it was time?  Or could I decide to clean it up and ask if she wanted to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>help<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; me?

These 2 do this kind of stuff and it isn&#39;t a big deal to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>me,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but most moms I know would have a cow about how they could get hurt (I do<br/>\n&gt; remind the kids to be careful because bonked heads hurt).-----but my 3yo<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t allowed to play out front by himself.  He has no fear at all and<br/>\n&gt; simply follows various wildlife off into the undeveloped land around us.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; talk a lot about needing to stay here but his priorities are different.

I want to always question myself, to try to figure<br/>\n&gt; out a way that the kids can do things they want safely, even if it is a<br/>\n&gt; little scary for me, rather than simply deny them, to be open to their<br/>\n </span></blockquote>input<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so we can have agreements about how things get done rather than me<br/>\n </span></blockquote>deciding<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; alone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Julie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 24<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 20 Nov 2001 19:01:57 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheran@...\">sheran@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: unschooling vs. unparenting<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hmm...What if everyone in the house said &#39;no thank you&#39; to doing the<br/>\n&gt; dishes?

But he gradually got over <br/>\nalmost all of his food weirdness.  His latest hurdle was not freaking if the <br/>\nlast portion of something got moldy or leftovers dried up in the fridge.   He <br/>\nused to agonize over the end parts of a head of lettuce, if we hadn&#39;t <br/>\nfinished it all before it went bad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids&#39; attitude toward food is vastly different.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Kathy","from":"&quot;Kathy&quot; &lt;laurawilder82@...&gt;","profile":"laurawilder82","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"57rHzZJQ9MN2gKWE8jQFJ-eVOrLWWvvvnhHemnkMMdRnLRAEtdMvSGTtjwLKZJHKGtwQDLtaHSvgexhexjXTVUvXIyCj3Eg1","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Candy and other stuff we want","postDate":"1006255476","msgId":28068,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDl0ZGVoaytuZW5xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGIyLjFmM2EwZjEuMjkyYjYwZmVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":28067,"nextInTopic":28076,"prevInTime":28067,"nextInTime":28069,"topicId":28060,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Milanos, candy, cheesecake, chocolate chunk brownies.
