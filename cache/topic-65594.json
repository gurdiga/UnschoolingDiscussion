I think what I&#39;m most<br/>\nlacking in at this point is confidence and experience.  I also have a fear<br/>\nof how my efforts will be discredited by DH and the court system if DH<br/>\nquestions our unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve recently learned about the Santa Fe Home Study Program, and am<br/>\nwondering if any of you are familiar with them or have ever used them.  It<br/>\nmay be just the ticket for me.  They will collect my log entries and<br/>\ntranslate them into class credits quarterly based upon hours.  They will<br/>\nalso provide support in helping to translate the day&#39;s activities into the<br/>\nlogbook entries.  I figure I could probably benefit by doing this with them<br/>\nfor a year.  Then I&#39;d probably have enough confidence and experience to go<br/>\nit on my own, although I may benefit legally from a sustained relationship<br/>\nwith them.  Any input appreciated, Thanks, Annette</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65591,"nextTopicId":65597}}
