I think that is exactly the issue here. The <br/>\nprincipal of Jack&#39;s school seems like a very nice person, I *think* (my first <br/>\nproblem &lt;g&gt;) that she just wants to know *everything* when it comes to her <br/>\nschool and may even take it as a slight that I would consider bringing Jack <br/>\nhome. (even though at the beginning of the year one of the first things I <br/>\ntold his teacher was that we hsed the kids and even though Jack convinced us <br/>\nhe wanted to go he would only be there this year) <br/>\nMy husband says that I need to learn to say *NO* more often. He asked if I <br/>\nhad sent the required notice in writing that Jack wouldn&#39;t be back next year <br/>\nto avoid the truancy monster and, if I had done so, then I should call <br/>\nsometime next week and politely state that we have always hsed the kids, our <br/>\nprivate school affidavit has been on file with the KBOE for 14 months, and <br/>\nwill continue to do so. That the only reason Jack went to school this year <br/>\nwas because we felt this was something he needed to work through himself to <br/>\nunderstand he wasn&#39;t missing what he thought he was going to be missing. <br/>\n(Darin also said if I really felt the need to say *something* I could state <br/>\nthat this was all just an experiment in what we call the plight of Americas <br/>\nfailed social experiment, but I don&#39;t think I will &lt;eg&gt;) He said I should say <br/>\nthat we enjoyed Jacks teacher and think the world of her, and wish the school <br/>\ncontinued success, politely say good bye before she could interject much more <br/>\nand hang up. Which is what many of you also suggested in not so many words <br/>\nand I thank you all! <br/>\nMy second problem is that I tend to go overboard when it comes to things like <br/>\nthis. I sent the woman the required letter, she asked for more and instead of <br/>\njust *warming her coffee up* I brewed a whole &#39;nother pot!<br/>\n<br/>\n*On a side note*  Sandra, I used your suggestions and the letter is now much <br/>\nstronger in context. I have printed it out and filed it away for that day <br/>\nwhen the kids are driving me crazy and I need something to explain to me why <br/>\nit is that I do this crazy thing I do! &lt;bwg&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy~ wavering no more!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113706655,"authorName":"dbatiste7@aol.com","from":"dbatiste7@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] the school wants more!","postDate":"1022355251","msgId":37444,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4LjFmYjM4ZTBhLjJhMjE0MTMzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":37435,"nextInTopic":37446,"prevInTime":37443,"nextInTime":37445,"topicId":37402,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/25/02 7:11:19 AM Pacific Daylight Time, ...

Did I <br/>\n  &gt; MISS something in it ?<br/>\n  &gt;   Betty<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi, Betty!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not Joyce, and I hope nobody minds my chiming in here, but even though <br/>\n  the letter got her point across very well, it could be perceived by the <br/>\n  school system as an attack.  She was essentially telling the school system <br/>\n  that they stink at what they do, and that&#39;s why homeschooling is a better <br/>\n  choice for her family.  While she is absolutely right, giving this kind of <br/>\n  information to the school system can come back to haunt a person in ways we <br/>\n  may not imagine.  In fact, I think that when we vent in general we have to <br/>\n  be very careful about what we say, how we say it, and to whom.  Putting <br/>\n  things in writing can be very risky because you don&#39;t know our words will <br/>\n  end up and how they could be used.  The words we write can even be <br/>\n  excerpted and used in ways we never intended.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As someone did mention, it is good to speak out and speak our truth, but <br/>\n  this may not be the venue for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I hate to sound so paranoid, but in a society where children are frequently <br/>\n  taken by the *authorities* from their loving and safe homes because parent <br/>\n  chose to be different than society&#39;s norms, I think we have to be vigilant <br/>\n  and watch our backs.  Certainly, writing a letter that&#39;s filled with <br/>\n  negatives about the school system can be seen as putting one&#39;s neck right <br/>\n  out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I liked very much what Joyce&#39;s letter had to say because it was completely <br/>\n  positive about homeschooling and not negative about the school <br/>\n  system.  Having said that, I still would be reluctant to provide the school <br/>\n  system with more than is legally required.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m really not a paranoid person, even though I really sound paranoid <br/>\n  (hmmm... I&#39;ve said that, I think, three times now!  ;-) ); I&#39;m just <br/>\n  cautious.  And, I&#39;ve heard enough horror stories to make me want to keep my <br/>\n  head below the radar, if you know what I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, apologies to everyone, especially Joyce, for chiming in on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Love,<br/>\n  ~marji~<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I believe that schools cannot be<br/>\n&gt;improved to the point<br/>\n&gt;that I would want my children to continue an education therein. I believe<br/>\n&gt;that children learn best<br/>\n&gt;by following their own interests. I am strongly opposed to the peer<br/>\n&gt;segregation practiced in classroom settings. Children separated by age<br/>\n&gt;groups, deprived of the chance to interact with those outside their peer<br/>\n&gt;group is the same as only being allowed to work at a job just for 35 year<br/>\n&gt;olds.

However, Kansas does <br/>\nrecognize Nonaccredited Private Schools.<br/>\n• A nonaccredited elementary or secondary private school is one that <br/>\nsatisfies the state&#39;s compulsory school attendance laws, but which is not <br/>\naccredited by the state board of education.<br/>\n• Compulsory school attendance laws apply to children between the ages of 7 <br/>\nand 18 (may be under 7 for children identified as handicapped). Every parent, <br/>\nor person acting as parent, of children in that age group must require such <br/>\nchildren to attend a public, private, denominational, or parochial school for <br/>\nthe duration of the school term. <br/>\n• Nonaccredited schools are not required to employ teachers who are certified <br/>\nby the state, but their courses must be taught by competent instructors, and <br/>\nthey must hold classes for a period of time which is substantially equivalent <br/>\nto the time public schools are in session in the area in which the <br/>\nnonaccredited school is located (at least 186 days of not less than 6 hours <br/>\nper day, or 1116 hours per year for grades 1-11).<br/>\n• Nonaccredited private schools are required by law to register the name and <br/>\naddress of the private elementary or secondary school with the state board of <br/>\neducation. Registration consists of completing a form provided by the state <br/>\nshowing the name and address of the school and the name and address of the <br/>\nofficial custodian of the school&#39;s records. The act of completing the <br/>\nregistration form does not mean the nonaccredited school has been &quot;approved&quot; <br/>\nby the state board of education as a &quot;school&quot; that satisfies the compulsory <br/>\nschool attendance law. <br/>\n• No fee is charged for registration of a nonaccredited school.<br/>\n• When a student transfers to a nonaccredited school, the school previously <br/>\nattended must be notified by the parent/guardian that the student is changing <br/>\nschools. If a student simply stops coming to school, the school is required <br/>\nby law to report the student as truant.<br/>\n• It is in the best interest of students attending nonaccredited schools that <br/>\naccurate and complete records of their progress be kept. These records will <br/>\nbe needed if the student transfers to a public or an accredited school, or <br/>\napplies for admission to a college or university.<br/>\n• If a student transfers from a nonaccredited school to an accredited school, <br/>\nthe accredited school is not required to accept the transfer of credit. The <br/>\naccredited school may find it necessary to test the student in order to make <br/>\na decision regarding the transfer of credit.<br/>\n• Private schools are responsible for acquiring their own books and curriculum<br/>\n materials. Books may be purchased from private organizations, checked out <br/>\nthough the public library, or rented from the public school with district <br/>\napproval. The public school is under no obligation to make books and <br/>\nmaterials available to students attending other schools.<br/>\n• No books, curriculum materials, guidelines, or technical assistance on <br/>\ncurriculum development are available from the State Department of Education <br/>\nfor nonaccredited schools.<br/>\n• Private schools, including nonaccredited schools issue their own high <br/>\nschool diplomas. The state does not issue diplomas.<br/>\n• Colleges and universities determine their own criteria for admission of <br/>\nstudents who graduate from a nonaccredited school.<br/>\nKansas Statute 72-53,100 through 102<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n72-53,100.
