People <br/>\ndon&#39;t listen to their bodies!  I actually was determined here a few <br/>\nmonths ago to retrain myself to eat meat because being a vegetarian is <br/>\nnot always convenient in social situations; bad decision because my <br/>\nbody was a MESS!  I don&#39;t know if it was because I haven&#39;t eaten meat <br/>\nin 10 years or what but I was all out of whack.  I listened and <br/>\nreturned to my nice vegetarian life, even stricter than before, and I <br/>\nfeel SOOOO much better.  I know people who can eat quite a bit of meat <br/>\nand feel fine though; same goes for sugar and lots of other things.  <br/>\nDifferent bodies handle things differently and we have to listen to <br/>\nour own bodies, same as being mindful of other areas of our lives and <br/>\nour kids lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":236897304,"authorName":"frozenandcold","from":"&quot;frozenandcold&quot; &lt;fivefreebirds@...&gt;","profile":"frozenandcold","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"re: making choices","postDate":"1132197003","msgId":109956,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRsZ3NhYit1bGxhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":109957,"prevInTime":109955,"nextInTime":109957,"topicId":109956,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Thank you Danielle!
