I would like to <br/>\n&gt;thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the long-time participants on this <br/>\n&gt;list for their wonderful insights and thoughtful discussions.  Many of the <br/>\n&gt;discussions (and repeat discussions!) over the past few months have really <br/>\n&gt;resonated with me: TV/video games; special needs; bedtimes; sibling <br/>\n&gt;fighting; chores; food; not to mention learning!  And I have been checking <br/>\n&gt;out many of the book recommendations . if the library staff ever look over <br/>\n&gt;the list of books I have out at any given time, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be rather <br/>\n&gt;bewildered!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My husband and I have been making this journey on our own, albeit slowly, <br/>\n&gt;since our first child was born. It started with not believing &quot;the experts&quot; <br/>\n&gt;who said eating and sleeping schedules are good, that meltdowns are about <br/>\n&gt;control, that he was just manipulating me, etc. I brushed them aside, but <br/>\n&gt;school and work outside the home were a-given, just permanent features of <br/>\n&gt;the landscape to be worked around. But, what is it they say, if things <br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t seem to be working as you expect, check your premises? (Actually, I <br/>\n&gt;picked that up from Atlas Shrugged many years ago and it has served me well <br/>\n&gt;so far &lt;g&gt;).  So, I ditched work three years ago, and school last year . or <br/>\n&gt;more rightly I told the kids I found out there was this thing called <br/>\n&gt;homeschooling and they all jumped at the offer to stay home!  I may *think* <br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m driving, though truly, since they were born they have been dragging me <br/>\n&gt;through this journey, but I just love being along for the ride!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;They left school March 2002 - they just didn&#39;t return after March Break.  <br/>\n&gt;For weeks they deschooled and I read about homeschooling. I did try to <br/>\n&gt;introduce a bit of structure (unit studies, math & spelling workbooks) <br/>\n&gt;somewhere around May, but that didn&#39;t last more than 3-4 weeks.  Can you <br/>\n&gt;believe it??  They flatly refused to stop their own learning activities to <br/>\n&gt;humour me! LOL!  So began the next leg of my journey into unschooling, <br/>\n&gt;which thankfully brought me here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And, once I&#39;d begun to trust the kids more and more to take control of <br/>\n&gt;their learning, I couldn&#39;t help but realize they could be trusted to take <br/>\n&gt;control of other aspects of their lives . TV, video games, sleeping, food <br/>\n&gt;etc.  You guys have helped me so much to stretch that last bit.  It hasn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;been a &quot;big&quot; change for us, just a bit more loosening of the reins. Early <br/>\n&gt;on I subscribed to the &quot;pick your battles&quot; mantra and I was *very* <br/>\n&gt;selective.  I could often understand why they were behaving in certain <br/>\n&gt;ways, that they were reactions to outside situations/forces, so our <br/>\n&gt;&quot;battles&quot; were relatively few and it just meant redrawing a few lines (or <br/>\n&gt;more rightly, erasing them).  There was no need for an &quot;announcement&quot; of a <br/>\n&gt;new lifestyle to the kids, just a bit of surprise on their part when they <br/>\n&gt;nudged a line and it was no longer there; just an honest discussion with <br/>\n&gt;Mom or Dad. We realized that for us it really comes down to principles, not <br/>\n&gt;rules (and a good chunk of deschooling on our part!).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So there&#39;s a bit of background for my intro.  I hope to share many of the <br/>\n&gt;interesting stories and insights I have gathered over the past year on the <br/>\n&gt;various topics of &quot;radical&quot; unschooling as I try to contribute more in the <br/>\n&gt;discussions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And thanks again to everyone for taking the time and effort to participate <br/>\n&gt;on this wonderful list!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pam L.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I guess I&#39;ll use my last initial to help distinguish between the various <br/>\n&gt;Pams here.

The two boys had the open, joyous, friendly confidence of kittens who do not expect to get hurt, they had an innocently natural, non-boastful sense of their own value and as innocent a trust in any stranger&#39;s ability to recognize it, they had the eager curiousity that would venture anywhere with the certainty that life held nothing unworthy of or closed to discovery, and they looked as if, should they encounter malevolence, they would reject it contemptuously, not as dangerous, but as stupid, they would not accept it in bruised resignation as the law of existence.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was given a copy by my father to read the summer I was 14, presented as kind of a right of passage.

I would like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the long-time participants on this list for their wonderful insights and thoughtful discussions.  Many of the discussions (and repeat discussions!) over the past few months have really resonated with me: TV/video games; special needs; bedtimes; sibling fighting; chores; food; not to mention learning!  And I have been checking out many of the book recommendations . if the library staff ever look over the list of books I have out at any given time, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be rather bewildered!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I have been making this journey on our own, albeit slowly, since our first child was born. It started with not believing &quot;the experts&quot; who said eating and sleeping schedules are good, that meltdowns are about control, that he was just manipulating me, etc. I brushed them aside, but school and work outside the home were a-given, just permanent features of the landscape to be worked around. But, what is it they say, if things don&#39;t seem to be working as you expect, check your premises? (Actually, I picked that up from Atlas Shrugged many years ago and it has served me well so far &lt;g&gt;).  So, I ditched work three years ago, and school last year . or more rightly I told the kids I found out there was this thing called homeschooling and they all jumped at the offer to stay home!  I may *think* I&#39;m driving, though truly, since they were born they have been dragging me through this journey, but I just love being along for the ride!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThey left school March 2002 - they just didn&#39;t return after March Break.  For weeks they deschooled and I read about homeschooling. I did try to introduce a bit of structure (unit studies, math & spelling workbooks) somewhere around May, but that didn&#39;t last more than 3-4 weeks.  Can you believe it??  They flatly refused to stop their own learning activities to humour me! LOL!  So began the next leg of my journey into unschooling, which thankfully brought me here. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, once I&#39;d begun to trust the kids more and more to take control of their learning, I couldn&#39;t help but realize they could be trusted to take control of other aspects of their lives . TV, video games, sleeping, food etc.  You guys have helped me so much to stretch that last bit.  It hasn&#39;t been a &quot;big&quot; change for us, just a bit more loosening of the reins.

We realized that for us it really comes down to principles, not rules (and a good chunk of deschooling on our part!). <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo there&#39;s a bit of background for my intro.  I hope to share many of the interesting stories and insights I have gathered over the past year on the various topics of &quot;radical&quot; unschooling as I try to contribute more in the discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thanks again to everyone for taking the time and effort to participate on this wonderful list!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPam L.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;ll use my last initial to help distinguish between the various Pams here.
