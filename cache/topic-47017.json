I did really appreciate everyone&#39;s posts, and I had great<br/>\nfun researching different dog breeds online, and reading about everyone&#39;s<br/>\nwonderful canine companions. Thanks you all...<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie sent a post right about Nana, the border collie who had wandered up<br/>\nto her porch a few months ago and needed a new place to live. We emailed<br/>\nback and forth a few times, and Nana arrived at the Sacramento airport<br/>\nlast Tuesdays. Yes, we have a DOG! <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s had a pretty rough life before finding Julie, and was pretty<br/>\nfreaked out by the long trip and new environment. She&#39;s feeling more<br/>\ncomfortable now, though. She comes to Rain and me for petting sometimes,<br/>\nand she really loves our cats and rats. She watches both of them for a<br/>\nlong, long time, slowly edging closer and closer. Our cats are old and<br/>\nfat and cranky and not a lot of fun (at least by Nana&#39;s standards - they<br/>\nwon&#39;t play herding games) so they sit until she gets too close and then<br/>\nyowl, which makes her jump back ... and then they start the process all<br/>\nover again. She&#39;s slowly exploring the farm - she generally sticks close<br/>\nto our house and is still scared of the three farm dogs (they&#39;re all big<br/>\nand a bit dopey, I think eventually they&#39;re make friends) so we generally<br/>\nput them inside when we let her out. The farmers have been harvesting the<br/>\ncotton from the fields right around us, so there&#39;s been a lot of loud<br/>\nmachinery out there - once that&#39;s done it will be peaceful again. She&#39;s<br/>\nscared when people come visit, all except for our 3 yr old friend Ellie,<br/>\nwhich was pretty cool - with Ellie she wagged her tail and came up to be<br/>\npetted. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we&#39;re happy :-) She also has a new Jerry Bears collar and a tag with<br/>\nNana Quinlan on it, and our phone number. We&#39;re looking forward to<br/>\nwatching her blossom as she gets more comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\nthe mom<br/>\nand Rain the 9 yr old, <br/>\nCozy and Pepper the cats, <br/>\nMary, Nicola, Little Mary, Robin Hood, and Tortoise the rats,<br/>\nand Nana the DOG</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47008,"nextTopicId":46952}}
