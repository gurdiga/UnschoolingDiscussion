Anna (13) and Ethan (11)  Pretty much the exact <br/>\nsame dynamics.  Ethan HATES to change clothes and bathe or brush his teeth <br/>\n(Ok basically, he  has horrible personal hygeine)  Well, now that he&#39;s <br/>\napproaching puberty, that boy can get RANK. .. Sometimes I just have to say, <br/>\nEthan, please take a shower, please.   It gets to the point that no one can <br/>\nstand to be around him, esp in close quarters like the van.  Usually, if he <br/>\nhasnt bathed and we are going somewhere, thats when I have to insist...  He <br/>\nstill protests and hates to do it.. but he will usually &quot;give in&quot;  Sometimes <br/>\nI just compromise and purseude him to just wash under his arms so he doesnt <br/>\nhave to take a complete shower.

Yesterday some folks were posting about <br/>\nhow thier boys didnt like to leave the house.. Had to drag them kicking and <br/>\nscreaming, etc.. and they were getting worse.. Well, Ethan is also the same <br/>\nin those regards.   This resisting bathing ,changing clothes, etc, is just <br/>\nanother way for him to avoid change.  Children with ADHD have a very <br/>\ndifficult time making transitions.   Just like some others said, its not <br/>\nreally the &quot;thing&quot; the kid is going to do that bugs them ( they may love the <br/>\nmovies or going to the library) Its the change of activities that upsets <br/>\nthem.  This was one BIG challange in Ethan going to public school.  He hated <br/>\ngetting up and getting ready .. it was horrible.. I am so glad I dont have to <br/>\ndeal with that anymore.   I try everything I can think of to make <br/>\ntransistions easier for Ethan.  But, nothing really seems to work.  He opts <br/>\nto stay home a lot of the time.. . And I know that he is really missing <br/>\nthings that he would enjoy if he would just come along. . But, I dont push <br/>\nhim, unless he HAS to go, ( like I dont want to stay home alone for a long <br/>\nperiod of time.)

I really try to make sure the kids<br/>\nare free to do what they choose as long as they are not infringing on the<br/>\nrights of others.  When they are it is discussed and since several of my<br/>\nkids are still quite young, they occassionally have to deal with the<br/>\nconsequences of their choices.  Example:  Shelly (3) is playing play station<br/>\nright now.  Danny (4) has been in pestering at her because she isn&#39;t playing<br/>\nhow he does.  I talked with Danny about how Shelly can play as she chooses,<br/>\nthat there are lots of ways to play the game, etc.  He continued and<br/>\ncontinued to pester at her until she became upset.  I attempted to get Danny<br/>\nto come do an activity with me but he was still into what Shelly was doing.<br/>\nSo I told him that he needed to come away and quit pestering her.  He<br/>\neventually was asked to leave the room.  But this is also the kid that peels<br/>\nhis own apples, climbs as high as he is comfortable  in trees, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nAdriane (12) is completely in control of her entire life.  She eats what and<br/>\nwhen she chooses, she sleeps where and when she chooses, watches and listens<br/>\nto whatever she chooses, bathes and brushes whenever she chooses, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nZach (10) is somewhere in the middle.  The choices he makes sometimes brush<br/>\nup against the rights of others.  Example:  He hates to brush his teeth.<br/>\nAfter a few days, I find it disgusting and don&#39;t want to hang out too close<br/>\nwith him.  It is not uncommon for me to ask him to brush his teeth when he<br/>\nwants me to do something with him that requires close contact.  He hates to<br/>\nchange his clothes but dh will often ask him to change if he wants to<br/>\naccompany dh somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53295,"nextTopicId":53774}}
