","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-187687386\">It&#39;s about time someone posted the name &quot;Early Edition&quot;.  Great show, but I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t going to post the name unless no one else had by the time that I<br/>\ncaught up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a fabulous show that started last fall.  DH found a review about<br/>\nit and we couldn&#39;t wait for it.  &quot;That Was Then&quot; was on the air for two<br/>\nshows only.  They even showed a preview for the next one and it never aired.<br/>\nIt was the story about a just turned 30 year old man who was not happy with<br/>\nhis life, he wished that he could go back to a pivotal point in his life<br/>\nwhen he was in high school so that he could change it.  He went to sleep and<br/>\nwhen he woke up, he was a teenager again.  As soon as he heard a certain<br/>\nsong, he was immediately transported to age 30 again, with a completely new<br/>\nlife.  Great show that I would have loved to have seen more of.  I taped the<br/>\nfirst two and I will definitely watch them again some day.  You know what<br/>\nthey showed on television instead?  Reruns of &quot;America&#39;s Funniest Videos&quot;.<br/>\nThat&#39;s American culture for you.  I wish that I could get ahold of all the<br/>\nepisodes that they made of &quot;That Was Then&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother show that was great for the first year that it was on was &quot;Sliders&quot;.<br/>\nThis was sort of a time warp traveling one through different possible<br/>\nrealities.  It got weird and horrorish after the first season.  I like<br/>\nScience Fiction, not Horror.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lisa in AZ</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":52496799,"authorName":"Tracy","from":"&quot;Tracy&quot; &lt;sablehs@...&gt;","profile":"sablehs","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Time Travel (wasTV Voluntarily Off)","postDate":"1054850888","msgId":72391,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJib2YwOCtmN3NiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg0LjEyNjJjNTUyLjJjMTBlODhkQGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72383,"nextInTopic":72402,"prevInTime":72390,"nextInTime":72392,"topicId":72323,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I like sci fi shows like Quantum Leap that show time travel.
