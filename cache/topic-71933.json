That&#39;s really <br/>\nfar from you, but I am fairly sure there are unschoolers down in your area.<br/>\nAs to the evals. It&#39;s mostly a formality in the younger years.<br/>\nThere is another option that you may be interested in, and that is an <br/>\numbrella school. The one I&#39;m with is only $10 per year, per child and requires almost <br/>\nnothing from you! It&#39;s great.  You can email me if you&#39;d like more info. <br/>\nabout that option.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71928,"nextTopicId":71935}}
