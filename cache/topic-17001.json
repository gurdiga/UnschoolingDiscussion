My triplets are almost three and I&#39;ve <br/>\nsubscribed to the list so that I can benefit from thinking about what you all <br/>\nhave to say as they grow.  Just finished Learning All the Time by John Holt <br/>\nand am only sorry I didn&#39;t read it sooner.  Very exciting book.  Nicki just <br/>\nintroduced herself as having a 5 yr old and I&#39;ll be watching how it goes with <br/>\nher.  Having three the same age is a slightly different kettle of fish in all <br/>\nareas, but kids are kids everywhere.  I live in central NJ and haven&#39;t hooked <br/>\nup with our local support group yet because the boys still nap in the <br/>\nafternoon and the group meets once a week at a park/skating rink during <br/>\nnaptime.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16995,"nextTopicId":17002}}
