Elliott William was 9 pounds, 6 ounces and the perfect ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-851341732\">Just thought I&#39;d let you know that after all my complaining our baby was born <br/>\nlast Thursday.  Elliott William was 9 pounds, 6 ounces and the perfect <br/>\nunmedicated birth!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was in and out of labor for DAYS.  Really.  A couple of days of <br/>\ninconsistent contractions followed by days of constant but irregular contractions.  Even <br/>\nin the womb, this one refused to follow a textbook pattern.  We spent a day or <br/>\nso at 15 to 20 minutes apart and then he organized pretty consistently at 10 <br/>\nminutes apart for a couple of hours.  Once he decided to drop from 10 minutes, <br/>\nwe were at 2 minutes apart in about an hour.  I hadn&#39;t intended to stay home <br/>\nquite so long, but we made it to the hospital with 45 minutes to spare.<br/>\n<br/>\n(A funny side note - I arrived at the hospital about 9 p.m. and had to go <br/>\nthrough the emergency room.  We scared the emergency staff with the frequency of <br/>\nthe contractions - and probably my screaming - so they wheeled us up really <br/>\nfast to labor and delivery.  In the waiting room of the ER were a bunch of <br/>\npeople there for a sleep study!  I wondering later how any of them got to sleep <br/>\nafter witnessing my &quot;I am woman, hear me roar&quot; act.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy midwife was fabulous at guiding me through labor.  My first son was born <br/>\nwith an epidural after 10 hours of back labor, my daughter came a year later <br/>\nwith a c-section due to placenta preevia.  This birth was so perfect that soon <br/>\nafter he was born I turned to my husband and said &quot;Oh, we have to do that <br/>\nagain!&quot;  I didn&#39;t tear, so recovery has been fairly easy.  Elliott had the cord <br/>\nwrapped around his head so his upper half of his head was badly bruised and he <br/>\nhad burst blood vessels in both his eyes.  His back was also bruised because he <br/>\ncame out so quickly, but he is recovering very nicely.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe hospital staff was great, for the most part.  They put the baby right in <br/>\nbed with me, put a big sign on his plastic bassinet that said &quot;No formula, no <br/>\npacifier&quot; and basically left me alone.  It was below zero here and they were <br/>\nvery busy with new babies.  The nurses have a theory about bad weather and <br/>\nbirthing.  The OB who delivered my daughter stopped by and congratulated me on <br/>\nvbac-ing such a large baby.  She said that staying home as long as I did <br/>\nfacilitated the natural birth perfectly, she enjoyed watching him on the monitor but <br/>\nnot coming into the room.  I guess she had to be there just in case.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks for all your advice about inducing labor.  Elliott just had to <br/>\narrive on his own schedule and I needed to respect that.  I did spend a lot <br/>\nof time watching movies while contracting away - Bowling for Columbine, Freda, <br/>\nthe whole first season of the West Wing, lot of American Experiences.  Now <br/>\nthat the baby is here, I can barely remember how frustrated I was waiting for <br/>\nhim!<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90102,"nextTopicId":90265}}
