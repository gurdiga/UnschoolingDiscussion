Now, we&#39;re talking about the ideas <br/>\nbehind the action of censorship.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Is it wrong to constrain a vision to what you believe is right?<br/>\nI believe that we cannot truly know what we believe if we constrain our <br/>\nvision. I think it was Plato(?) in the allegory of the cave who told the <br/>\nstory of some people who were chained to a cave wall and only ever able to <br/>\nsee shadows on the wall opposite. They believed that all reality was shadows, <br/>\nbecause that was their only experience. One day, one of the people got loose <br/>\nfrom his chains, and went outside. He discovered that true reality was much <br/>\nmore than shadows when seen in the full light of day. When he went back to <br/>\nhis friends whose &quot;vision was constrained,&quot; they refused to believe him or <br/>\nlisten.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The unschooling debate here is constrained by the ideal of treating <br/>\nchildren<br/>\nas fellow human beings due the respect that adult humans get. It&#39;s what<br/>\nideas are judged and weighed against.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with this, but would add that we should also treat adults with the <br/>\nsame respect that we would our children.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Is that ideal necessary for unschooling? Shouldn&#39;t someone question <br/>\nwhether<br/>\nthat ideal is necessary for unschooling? And if it isn&#39;t, shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nunschooling ideas that don&#39;t encompass that particular ideal be allowed to<br/>\nstand side by side with those that do?<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, we should always question---that is how we learn. There is no definition <br/>\nfor unschooling, other than the broken down word itself---un = not  +  <br/>\nschooling. Schooling is many things, so notschooling must be as many opposite <br/>\nthings. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. If someone&#39;s idea of unschooling includes coercive parenting, are they<br/>\nunschooling wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all may wish we could parent and relate to others without coercion, but <br/>\nalmost every interaction with others involves some level of coercion. If I <br/>\nask my child to scrape his plate into the trash is that coercive ?, and if he <br/>\nrefuses and then I scrape it so that there will be a clean plate later, am I <br/>\nbeing manipulated? Is coercion in our daily living O.K. but not O.K. <br/>\nregarding academics? If I say to my child, I want to teach you how to tie <br/>\nyour shoes because I&#39;m sick of tying them, and you are old enough to learn, <br/>\nis that wrong? Then if I say I want to teach you how to read because I&#39;m sick <br/>\nof reading everything for you, you are old enough to learn, and besides I&#39;ve <br/>\ngot my own book to read, is that wrong? Unschooling is an ideal, something we <br/>\nwork toward with different levels of purity and success.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. If someone says something doesn&#39;t work, is it because the theory doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork in all cases or because someone wasn&#39;t doing it right? Does someone<br/>\nneed to be able to articulate unschooling well in order to understand it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that we are all different, and that things that work for some, don&#39;t <br/>\nalways work for others. Also some theories are just lousy and don&#39;t work in <br/>\npractice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think we need to be able to articulate something in order to <br/>\nunderstand it, but I think articulating most things helps us to gain deeper <br/>\nunderstanding. Some people are incredibly intuitive and spiritual and don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel the need to articulate their experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. If something truly doesn&#39;t work, would anyone be brave enough to come here<br/>\nand say so?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think many wouldn&#39;t, not only because of what happened to Ned, but because <br/>\nothers have been attacked for stating views different from certain very <br/>\nstrong-minded individuals whose personal definitions of what constitutes <br/>\nunschooling seem rather rigid to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Lots and lots of debate has at it&#39;s foundation goals that differ. Someone<br/>\ncan argue that punishment works while someone argues that punishment<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t. If both families have decent children, how can one be wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, they can both be right because they have different goals. The first<br/>\nhas a goal of training their kids to do right. The second of helping their<br/>\nkids make their own decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that both are right. If the children are blooming, growing, and <br/>\nhappy---then they are both right. I&#39;ve known both types to raise wonderful <br/>\nchildren, and I&#39;ve known both types to raise rotten nasty children. I think <br/>\nwhat the successful ones have in common, are their capacity for love, <br/>\nforgiveness, fairness and a strong sense of right and wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Does unschooling only encompass the goals of the best debaters here? If <br/>\nthat<br/>\nis limiting unschooling, is calling this Unschooling.com misleading?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour best point. You&#39;ve said it better than I can.

Undoubtedly Christian debate can<br/>\nfeel like real open debate but it&#39;s constrained by the Christian viewpoint.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone brings in ideas from a secular viewpoint that are incompatible<br/>\nwith the Christian viewpoint, are the ideas wrong? Or is the Christian list<br/>\nwrong? Is it wrong to constrain a vision to what you believe is right?<br/>\n<br/>\nKind of a scary thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unschooling debate here is constrained by the ideal of treating children<br/>\nas fellow human beings due the respect that adult humans get. It&#39;s what<br/>\nideas are judged and weighed against.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that ideal necessary for unschooling? Shouldn&#39;t someone question whether<br/>\nthat ideal is necessary for unschooling? And if it isn&#39;t, shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nunschooling ideas that don&#39;t encompass that particular ideal be allowed to<br/>\nstand side by side with those that do?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone&#39;s idea of unschooling includes coercive parenting, are they<br/>\nunschooling wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone comes in here with incompatible ideas and they &quot;get shouted down&quot;<br/>\nis it because their ideas were full of holes or because a few posters with<br/>\nnarrow views are more skilled at debate?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone says something doesn&#39;t work, is it because the theory doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork in all cases or because someone wasn&#39;t doing it right? Does someone<br/>\nneed to be able to articulate unschooling well in order to understand it?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf something truly doesn&#39;t work, would anyone be brave enough to come here<br/>\nand say so?<br/>\n<br/>\nLots and lots of debate has at it&#39;s foundation goals that differ. Someone<br/>\ncan argue that punishment works while someone argues that punishment<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t. If both families have decent children, how can one be wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, they can both be right because they have different goals. The first<br/>\nhas a goal of training their kids to do right. The second of helping their<br/>\nkids make their own decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes unschooling only encompass the goals of the best debators here? If that<br/>\nis limiting unschooling, is calling this Unschooling.com misleading?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust things to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Ned, censorship, list manners","postDate":"1042052527","msgId":53833,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyZDQwMWMyYjc0OCRiMjc3ODFlMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDE1OS4xYTEzMjE1Yi4yYjRkOThmMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53832,"nextInTopic":53846,"prevInTime":53832,"nextInTime":53834,"topicId":53549,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... save ...
