I know <br/>\nthat&#39;s a luxury, because my husband, who has a home-based business, always <br/>\nseems to be working. The phone rings for him at night, on weekends, during <br/>\nmeals, etc. He claims he has to answer the calls right away because <br/>\notherwise clients might go to someone else. But I always let the answering <br/>\nmachine get it if I&#39;m home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read recently that some of the Amish have conceded to use telephones, but <br/>\nthey keep them in booths out in the fields, so they don&#39;t interrupt their <br/>\nfamily lives. That sounded like a great idea to me. I get so tired of phone <br/>\ninterruptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10081,"nextTopicId":10086}}
