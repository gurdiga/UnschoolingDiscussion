Your child is normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may well go thru a process of &quot;deschooling&quot; which looks suspiciously like <br/>\ndoing nothing for an annoyingly long period of time.  That&#39;s OK.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your child wants to do a math-type activity, great.  If not, that&#39;s OK too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, sorry to disappoint your ds, but his activities already involve a lot of <br/>\nscience and math! :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe beauty of hsing -- you get to be yourself!<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30760,"nextTopicId":30778}}
