What is &quot;speech&quot;?<br/>\nA baby unable to make any utterance might be said to be without speech.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn adult who had had a stroke or something and was no longer communicating <br/>\nverbally would be said to have lost speech.<br/>\n<br/>\nLanguage and speech aren&#39;t the same thing, exactly.   It&#39;s easy for it to <br/>\nseem so among people whose speech capability is used to communicate <br/>\nlinguistically.   There they seem the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone has no larynx left (accident, smoking, cancer, something) but can <br/>\nstill read and write, hear and maybe learns to sign, he still has language, <br/>\nbut not speech.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a desert island a baby raised by... a coconut or something... would <br/>\nvocalize, and might make patterns and names to entertain himself, but it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nlanguage unless there was another person who understood it and communicated <br/>\nwith him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame issues exist with reading.   Does sounding out words equal reading?   I <br/>\ncan sound out words in some languages I can neither speak nor understand, but <br/>\nI know the phonics rules.   So can I &quot;read&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nReading is quite complex, and schools like to give people an A in reading, or <br/>\nsay &quot;Oh, yes, her reading is coming along great&quot; of people who cannot <br/>\nhonestly, fully read in the wilds of the the real world, but are doing great with <br/>\nphonics worksheets and programmed readers.     <br/>\n<br/>\nOne reason unschoolers&#39; reports of reading seem   shockingly late to some <br/>\npeople is that we aren&#39;t dealing with phonics work sheets and programmed readers, <br/>\nso reading (in the real world) is NOT sounding out three letter words on <br/>\nlists or doing other reading-readiness exercises.   It&#39;s picking up real written <br/>\ncommunications and understanding what they say.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf reading is sounding out, then silent reading isn&#39;t reading.   I don&#39;t <br/>\n&quot;sound out&quot; (in my head) more than maybe one word in 10,000 when I&#39;m reading, and <br/>\nthat would be the name of a place or person I&#39;ve never seen, or a term that&#39;s <br/>\nnew to me.    <br/>\n<br/>\nRiding bikes, my recent best analogy:   There&#39;s riding a bike (a little bike, <br/>\nwith training wheels) and riding a bike (for the first time without training <br/>\nwheels, when dad lets go, but that doesn&#39;t mean turning or stopping) and then <br/>\nthere&#39;s going on a twenty-mile ride and keeping up.    Which is &quot;riding a <br/>\nbike&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109697,"nextTopicId":109704}}
