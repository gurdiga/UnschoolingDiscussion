I couldn&#39;t have said it better. I despise seeing the bullies run the show here and how they think that their sarcastic, flippant responses are so wonderful. It is borderline abusive and really not necessary. <br/>\nYet I still enjoy getting to know new unschoolers and mingling with old ones. So what to do? I thought that by the list splitting, we&#39;d see a change but because of the way the list is set up, the bullies can come back anytime and stir up trouble. I&#39;ve written to each new person who has left within the last few weeks (the ones I was aware of) and asked them not to go but the majority has responded that they don&#39;t need this sh*t in their lives. I don&#39;t either! So, I am going to set up another list for anyone interested.<br/>\nGroup name : <br/>\nunschoolfamilies<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup home page : <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolfamilies\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolfamilies</a><br/>\n <br/>\n It *will* be moderated (free posting except when it&#39;s determined you are posting hostile, bullish language.. determined by the moderators) and you can&#39;t just automatically sub to it(an intro letter from you is required). It&#39;s a pain to set it up that way but it is obviously necessary. <br/>\nI hate to see that this list has come to this but at the same time, I&#39;m ready to move on and have some more discussion like we were having here prior to this week-end.<br/>\nEnough is enough...<br/>\nSarah (another long-time unschooler!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;I&#39;m a long-time unschooler.

It reminds me of <br/>\nChristian fundamentalists<br/>\nwho &quot;compete&quot; over who is more &quot;holy&quot;.
