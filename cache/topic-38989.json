Although it is really what I know is right, I do have trouble &#39;letting go&#39;, so I appreciate all the encouragement here.  <br/>\nI&#39;m coming out of lurkdom to answer Deb&#39;s question about the history or California&#39;s name, since that is where we live.  Here is the info that I learned:<br/>\nThe name &quot;California&quot; came from a knightly romance book that was published in 1510. It was about an island paradise near the Indies where beautiful Queen Califia ruled over a country of beautiful black Amazons with lots of pearls and gold. Men were only allowed there one day a year to help perpetuate the race. Cortez&#39;s men thought they found the island in 1535, because they found pearls. Later, Francisco de Ulloa found that the island was really a peninsula.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__/ /&#92;____ ____<br/>\n,·´º o`·,/__/ _/&#92;_ //____/&#92;<br/>\n```)¨(´´´ | | | | | | | || |l±±±± |<br/>\n¸,.-·²°´ ¸,.-·~·~·-.,¸ `°²·-. :º°<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMarianne ~ &quot;...but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.&quot; Joshua 24:15<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9202466,"authorName":"Beth Ali","from":"&quot;Beth Ali&quot; &lt;blali@...&gt;","profile":"blali2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2145","postDate":"1025927915","msgId":38996,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWMyMjRhMSQ2NzhmYjEwMCRjODI1MjM0M0BwYXZpbGlvbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwMjU4NjYyMTQuMzc3LjU4Mjk2Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDwzRDI2MzAxOC4yRDMxQ0JFNkBndGUubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":38994,"nextInTopic":38997,"prevInTime":38995,"nextInTime":38997,"topicId":38989,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That sounds soooo totally awesome and super fun!!

I read a story about<br/>\n  Johnny Appleseed to them and as we went through it put in th Mississippi<br/>\n  and the Ohio Rivers. Then we went outside and got some little twigs and<br/>\n  made &quot;apple trees&quot; in the Ohio River Valley, planted by Johnny. THen I<br/>\n  found my bead box, so we could put red bead apples on the trees. THen we<br/>\n  went wild, and put a giant red bead for New York (the Big Apple) which<br/>\n  they ahd visited recently. And a big white bead for the white house in<br/>\n  Washington, D.C. And we used some green beads for evergreen trees in the<br/>\n  Rockies. But we didn&#39;t have enough so we took a walk to look for pine<br/>\n  trees and other stuff that would be useful for our &quot;map&quot;. WE found<br/>\n  Spanish moss (we live in FLorida) to put across Florida and Louisiana,<br/>\n  acorn caps which turned into a zillion little s canoes for Indian beads<br/>\n  that went up and down the rivers, small rocks to add to the Rockies,<br/>\n  some seashells to put on FLorida&#39;s coast, a pine cone for the Redwood<br/>\n  forest area in CA, and some cactus to put in the southwest deserts. WE<br/>\n  made a little wagon and log cabin out of twigs just over the<br/>\n  Appalachians where Daniel Boone or Davy Crocket might have gone. Then we<br/>\n  settled down and heard the rest of the story.
