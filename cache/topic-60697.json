It was embarrassing but I just couldn&#39;t stop doing it.<br/>\nEven as a teenager, I had this boyfriend who thought women only cried to<br/>\nmanipulate men, and he used to yell at me all the time for crying and I<br/>\ntried so hard to stop, but I couldn&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a lot better now (I&#39;m 27) but there was one time just last year that<br/>\nI was eating lunch with my husband and kids in a restaurant and I wanted<br/>\nto go to Barnes and Noble afterwards and my husband said he was sick of<br/>\nBarnes and Noble (we&#39;d been going almost every weekend because it was<br/>\nclose and the kids like the play area).  Well, I just started crying and<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t stop.  I know that sounds stupid.

He cries<br/>\nall the time and it&#39;s hard to understand why sometimes.  Yesterday he<br/>\nwanted to have a picnic on the living room floor and I was sitting on a<br/>\nblanket with his brother, when he came in carrying about 12 forks.

He&#39;s 22 now,<br/>\nand a Marine, and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s cried at all since he was about 15.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that&#39;s not really advice, and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s helpful at<br/>\nall.  But I assure you, people who cry easily aren&#39;t trying to<br/>\nmanipulate people, and telling them it&#39;s irrational to be crying is only<br/>\ngoing to make them cry harder.

She cries a lot over what seems to be nothing at all. Now I try <br/>\nto put myself in her position to understand, but to be honest, most of the <br/>\ntime I just don&#39;t get it. I&#39;ve tried talking to her when she gets like this <br/>\nand it makes things so much worse. I can&#39;t even begin to talk to her about <br/>\nwhy she&#39;s crying until much later. If I even try a half hour later, she&#39;ll <br/>\nstart crying all over again. I&#39;ve tried holding her and she just keeps <br/>\ncrying and crying. It seems like leaving her alone works best for her to get <br/>\nover it. As much as it works, I hate doing it. Just leaving her to cry.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples: The other night, Joe was getting her into the shower. She wanted <br/>\nto take a bath. So Joe got the shower ready for her to do her hair first and <br/>\nthen run the bath for her to play. Well I had in another time, given her a <br/>\nbath first and conditioned her hair, let her play and then rinse her hair <br/>\nout after. Joe didn&#39;t know and she didn&#39;t ask or say anything. She just <br/>\nstarted to cry. Finding out later that she wanted to bath first and then <br/>\nshower her hair.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoe and I are making a very thoughtful effort to explain things and ask more <br/>\nso she understands and we do too. But it&#39;s not always things like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight she was starting to feel worse again. With everyone else getting <br/>\nbetter, she&#39;ll get everyone else sick again. I was trying to get her to take <br/>\nsome meds so she wouldn&#39;t get a lot worse. I gave her two choices and she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want either one. She went and got into bed before anyone else, I <br/>\nrubbed her down with Vicks and she was fine. When Joe went to put Alyssa to <br/>\nbed, Sierra was crying like crazy. No one had a clue as to what was wrong. <br/>\nTurns out she just started to cry because she couldn&#39;t breath. I got her <br/>\ncalmed down and then she wanted to take a Sudafed. She comes out to do that, <br/>\nshe&#39;s drinking water and I&#39;m doing dishes and she just starts to cry again. <br/>\nThis time because she dropped her pill on the floor. It wasn&#39;t that she <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t find it cause she didn&#39;t even look. She just started to cry because <br/>\nshe dropped it. Joe got her settled and found the pill and she took it and <br/>\nthen went to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow before anyone thinks it&#39;s just because she&#39;s sick, that isn&#39;t the case. <br/>\nThese are just the latest examples that I can think of. Even when she&#39;s <br/>\nperfectly fine, these types of things still bring her to crying.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes she&#39;ll start to cry just because she can&#39;t finish something to <br/>\neat. Now she never gets yelled at for any of these types of things from any <br/>\nof us. The kids are never punished. That&#39;s what makes this all so hard to <br/>\nget. I can&#39;t see where she would be afraid of anything. No one is making fun <br/>\nor anything close to that. Now sometimes it is her brother pushing her <br/>\nbuttons. That I get.

He&#39;s 22 now,<br/>\nand a Marine, and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s cried at all since he was about 15.<br/>\n <br/>\nI guess that&#39;s not really advice, and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s helpful at<br/>\nall.  But I assure you, people who cry easily aren&#39;t trying to<br/>\nmanipulate people, and telling them it&#39;s irrational to be crying is only<br/>\ngoing to make them cry harder.  I think emotional control comes with<br/>\nage.<br/>\n <br/>\nSorcha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] criers","postDate":"1047381530","msgId":60704,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMTRoZm93aXN5N3BJNFNJS2IwMDAzMjFkZEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":60698,"nextInTopic":60706,"prevInTime":60703,"nextInTime":60705,"topicId":60697,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;ve actually thought about that. I&#39;ve even asked her if she wanted <br/>\nto join an acting class but she&#39;s not interested. (it&#39;s for homeschoolers)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom came me to one day and asked if I knew Sierra could make herself cry <br/>\non command. Now my mom has a tendency to be a &quot;Oh that didn&#39;t hurt you&#39;re <br/>\nnot really crying&quot; kind of person. So I really can&#39;t be sure if she is <br/>\nright. Whenever I&#39;ve seen it happen, this kid is really crying. Now she can <br/>\nprolong it once she gets going. That&#39;s why holding her doesn&#39;t help. She <br/>\nreally gets it going when someone is around.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s rather reassuring to know someone else was pretty much the same way and <br/>\nwas able to overcome it later on. Not comforting that it was terrible for <br/>\nyou. I guess one reason why I&#39;m so concerned is I remember a friend from <br/>\ngrade school. Poor Jamie sat in front of me and had bright red hair and very <br/>\npale skin. She wore her hair always in two braided pig tails. If the teacher <br/>\ncalled on her and she didn&#39;t know what to say, her ears would turn bright <br/>\nred and I knew she was going to cry. She cried for everything, even with us <br/>\nkids only. Very sensitive. I remember later on kids making fun of her. It <br/>\ncertainly wasn&#39;t anything she seemed to enjoy. I left that school in 5th <br/>\ngrade so I never found out how Jamie dealt with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the outlook of how hard it may be for Sierra to deal with too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] criers","postDate":"1047364136","msgId":60698,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVhLjE5MWFhZjJhLjJiOWVkYzI4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":60697,"nextInTopic":60704,"prevInTime":60697,"nextInTime":60699,"topicId":60697,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/11/2003 1:05:15 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...

She cries a lot over what seems to be nothing at all. Now I try <br/>\nto put myself in her position to understand, but to be honest, most of the <br/>\ntime I just don&#39;t get it. I&#39;ve tried talking to her when she gets like this <br/>\nand it makes things so much worse. I can&#39;t even begin to talk to her about <br/>\nwhy she&#39;s crying until much later. If I even try a half hour later, she&#39;ll <br/>\nstart crying all over again. I&#39;ve tried holding her and she just keeps <br/>\ncrying and crying. It seems like leaving her alone works best for her to get <br/>\nover it. As much as it works, I hate doing it. Just leaving her to cry.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples: The other night, Joe was getting her into the shower. She wanted <br/>\nto take a bath. So Joe got the shower ready for her to do her hair first and <br/>\nthen run the bath for her to play. Well I had in another time, given her a <br/>\nbath first and conditioned her hair, let her play and then rinse her hair <br/>\nout after. Joe didn&#39;t know and she didn&#39;t ask or say anything. She just <br/>\nstarted to cry. Finding out later that she wanted to bath first and then <br/>\nshower her hair.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoe and I are making a very thoughtful effort to explain things and ask more <br/>\nso she understands and we do too. But it&#39;s not always things like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight she was starting to feel worse again. With everyone else getting <br/>\nbetter, she&#39;ll get everyone else sick again. I was trying to get her to take <br/>\nsome meds so she wouldn&#39;t get a lot worse. I gave her two choices and she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want either one. She went and got into bed before anyone else, I <br/>\nrubbed her down with Vicks and she was fine. When Joe went to put Alyssa to <br/>\nbed, Sierra was crying like crazy. No one had a clue as to what was wrong. <br/>\nTurns out she just started to cry because she couldn&#39;t breath. I got her <br/>\ncalmed down and then she wanted to take a Sudafed. She comes out to do that, <br/>\nshe&#39;s drinking water and I&#39;m doing dishes and she just starts to cry again. <br/>\nThis time because she dropped her pill on the floor. It wasn&#39;t that she <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t find it cause she didn&#39;t even look. She just started to cry because <br/>\nshe dropped it. Joe got her settled and found the pill and she took it and <br/>\nthen went to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow before anyone thinks it&#39;s just because she&#39;s sick, that isn&#39;t the case. <br/>\nThese are just the latest examples that I can think of. Even when she&#39;s <br/>\nperfectly fine, these types of things still bring her to crying.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes she&#39;ll start to cry just because she can&#39;t finish something to <br/>\neat. Now she never gets yelled at for any of these types of things from any <br/>\nof us. The kids are never punished. That&#39;s what makes this all so hard to <br/>\nget. I can&#39;t see where she would be afraid of anything. No one is making fun <br/>\nor anything close to that. Now sometimes it is her brother pushing her <br/>\nbuttons. That I get. But a lot of the time it&#39;s nothing of the sort.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas??<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7285,"nextTopicId":60935}}
