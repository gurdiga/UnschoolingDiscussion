This list has been pretty intense the last few days and I thought some might appreciate a light story of unschooling &quot;success-in-progress.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n************<br/>\nI just wanted to share (with people who would truly appreciate it) some writing Dane just handed me.  I will put all the translations into parentheses.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe drew out a &quot;cartoon&quot; titled Mi PT BD.  (My Pet Beetle)<br/>\nI&#39;m going to try to explain this as best as I can.  There are a bunch of little drawings all over the paper and each one has a little caption bubble above its head.  The captions are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;NO&quot; (No)<br/>\n&quot;OOY&quot; (Yes)<br/>\n&quot;IM WAD&quot; (I&#39;m waiting)<br/>\n&quot;IKBU&quot; (I can beat you)<br/>\n&quot;P&quot; (pfft)<br/>\n&quot;Di&quot; (die)<br/>\n&quot;No&quot; (no)<br/>\n&quot;Surrender&quot;  {This was actually written by Beck (8)}<br/>\n&quot;UH&quot; (uh)<br/>\n&quot;KM BAK&quot; (come back)<br/>\n&quot;No&quot; (no)<br/>\n&quot;plez&quot; (please)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t say it made any sense...lol....but it was cute.  I love all the phonetic/invented spelling.  And I love that Dane is learning to read and write at his own pace and feels no shame or pressure for it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to anyone who made it through this.<br/>\n<br/>\nJen  :o)<br/>\nMom to Beck (8) and Dane (5)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93115,"nextTopicId":93125}}
