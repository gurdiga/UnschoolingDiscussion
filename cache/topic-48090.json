I&#39;ve read and agreed with Sandra&#39;s writings for several years. I also enjoy the frankness of this list and have gotten a lot out of it. However, the name-calling, deliberate twisting of words, put-downs, and flat refusal to accept that other&#39;s have a right to hold their own views is totally against what I believe unschooling should be about. No matter if a parent spanks or believes in God or is young, they may still have valuable input to offer and they are being squashed right out of posting on this list. The atmosphere here is that if you don&#39;t fit in the &quot;perfect parent&quot; box or at least repent of what you do that makes you not the &quot;perfect parent&quot; and promise to try harder, that you&#39;re not welcome, you&#39;re stupid, and you don&#39;t care about your children. While that attitude may help some people, it turns even more away that could benefit from the ideas and philosophies that go along with unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, BTW, I&#39;m on two other lists that have 500+ members and neither of them have even a fraction of the flaming and attacking going on here. It&#39;s very possible when everyone works together as a team and helps each other. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n <br/>\n  From: marji <br/>\n  Yes.  I agree with the &quot;truely [sic] wonderful&quot; and &quot;honestly helpful&quot; <br/>\n  parts.

What the posters you see as <br/>\n  &quot;mean&quot; and &quot;hurtful&quot; lack in sweetness is more than made up several-fold in <br/>\n  honesty and helpfulness.  I only wish you could appreciate and benefit from <br/>\n  that!

There are times when I read a <br/>\n  post by those &quot;mean&quot; folks and I&#39;m just so very grateful for their ability <br/>\n  to stay on target!

(Hope I&#39;m not stepping on any toes, Joyce-moderator!)<br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n  <br/>\n  I think it&#39;s very sad that you would be so rude to a newcomer on the <br/>\n  list.  I think it&#39;s sad that you would be intolerant of other <br/>\n  people&#39;s parenting practices.  Even if it does give you cold chills, <br/>\n  there are much nicer ways to talk to people you disagree with.  You <br/>\n  catch more flies with honey...<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily true that one can&#39;t be an unschooler <br/>\n  AND choose to spank.  I would think that totally unschooling would <br/>\n  usually lead to a non-spanking position, but that&#39;s just my guess.  <br/>\n  Not everyone gets there at the same time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  If a spanker would say to a non-spanker, &quot;I don&#39;t want to read <br/>\n  anything else you have to say&quot;, they would get slammed big time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  And I&#39;ve had two people tell me that my posts repulsed them, just <br/>\n  because I support parental rights.  If I told someone who doesn&#39;t <br/>\n  believe in parental rights that their posts repulsed me, I would get <br/>\n  slammed big time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Is it ok to be verbally mean to people because they have a different <br/>\n  point of view?  That&#39;s not good discussion and it&#39;s not good <br/>\n  debating.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  As far as who is disrupting the list, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the people <br/>\n  who are brave enough to stick up for their right to discipline their <br/>\n  children according to their own consciences, I think it&#39;s the handful <br/>\n  of people who reply with cold meanness. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
