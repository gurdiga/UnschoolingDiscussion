I hope you won&#39;t my piping up on this question.  I&#39;m really new to <br/>\nthis list, and although the volume of mail has been tremendous, I have been <br/>\nenjoying reading what I can when I can.  I noticed this particular little <br/>\nthread, and loved what Sandra had to say about this.  I hope you won&#39;t mind <br/>\nmy two cents here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems to me that if my kid were grumpy about not getting enough rest <br/>\nbecause he didn&#39;t get enough sleep, I&#39;d be *quietly* sympathetic.  If he <br/>\nwas late going to a thing he really wanted to go to and/or missed it <br/>\nbecause he didn&#39;t plan for it, and was terribly disappointed, I&#39;d be <br/>\n*quietly* sympathetic.

I suppose I could offer up advice about what he <br/>\n*should have* done, but unsolicited advice is usually not appreciated and <br/>\nbenefits no one (I think it only builds up the advisor at the expense of <br/>\nthe advisee).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds to me like Kirby has figured out exactly what he needs to do to <br/>\nbe able to get done what he wants to get done (I hope that made sense <br/>\n{g}).  Being able to figure out these things - all things - for ourselves, <br/>\nI think, is our birthright, no matter what our age.  When we need help <br/>\nfiguring them out, we can ask for help, which, ultimately, is part of being <br/>\nable to figure out for ourselves what to do:  We figure out whom to ask or <br/>\nwhere to look for the information we need.  (If I play my cards right, I <br/>\nhope I&#39;ll be one of the people my son knows he can look to for help when he <br/>\nneeds it.  He&#39;ll only do that if he can trust me to offer nonjudgmental <br/>\nhelp that he can accept or refuse without my getting offended or weird.  In <br/>\nother words, if he knows he won&#39;t have to hear &quot;I told you so&quot; and &quot;Of <br/>\ncourse you&#39;re late; you should have...&quot; and other know--it-all stuff <br/>\nparents are so good at shoveling up.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people have to learn to do something, they just do it.  If there are a <br/>\nfew bumps along the way (grumpy from lack of sleep, for example), they&#39;ll <br/>\nbe able to figure out what went wrong and how to deal with it the next <br/>\ntime.
