I really feel for you <br/>\nholding your tongue, sort of.  I have to do this with my SIL as well.  She is <br/>\na clean your plate person with one child and the otehr doesn&#39;t eat much at <br/>\nall.  She is built like my son.  Tall and skinny.  My SIL sees it as she is not <br/>\neating enough so she pushes everything on this girl.  If she won&#39;t eat what is <br/>\nout for supper than she she gets her to eat anything, candy, cookies etc.  She <br/>\nkeeps harping on the poor girl until she eats something.  I do hold my tongue <br/>\nthough.  I know people have their own parenting styles.

My niece goes to day care <br/>\nand is there most of the day.  As soon as my SIL (no  longer <br/>\nmarried to my brother) and my niece get home, my SIL makes <br/>\nmy niece eat.  It has never been an option of &quot;are you hungry&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;do you want to eat now?&quot;  It&#39;s just a rule.  If my niece isn&#39;t hungry <br/>\nand doesn&#39;t want to eat much (after all, she did just get home <br/>\nand wants to spend some time with mommy), then she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nget to eat anything else that night.  If my niece (who&#39;s name is <br/>\nLinzie) wants something later in the evening, then my SIL will <br/>\neither tell her no or force her to eat cold left over dinner.  Of <br/>\ncourse, what 22 month old will eat cold dinner that&#39;s been sitting <br/>\nout?  So, she dosen&#39;t eat it and then goes to bed hungry.  &quot;bed <br/>\ntime&quot; is another thing, my SIL forces Linzie to go to bed at 8 pm, <br/>\nperiod.  If she doesn&#39;t want to (like when I&#39;m visiting and she&#39;s <br/>\nexcited to see me), then she just has to scream until she goes to <br/>\nsleep.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m coming from a household (with my husband and 2 year old <br/>\ndaughter) where none of that happens so I just don&#39;t understand <br/>\nit.  My daughter eats when she&#39;s hungry and stops when she&#39;s <br/>\nfull.  I will ask her what she wants to eat at around 6 or so but, if <br/>\nshe says nothing then I don&#39;t force her to eat.  Usually, once I get <br/>\nmyself something or my husband gets his dinner, then she will <br/>\nhave what we are having.  But, not always.  She will ALWAYS <br/>\ncome up and ask me for what she wants, when she&#39;s hungry.  <br/>\nWhich may be at 5 pm or may be at 8 pm.  As for bed time, she <br/>\ngoes to bed when she&#39;s tired.  Most times it&#39;s around 9 or so but <br/>\nsometimes it&#39;s as early as 8 and as late as 11pm, it just <br/>\ndepends on if or when she napped that day.  I have never let her <br/>\ncry herself to sleep because I would rather have some &quot;alone <br/>\ntime.&quot;  Sure, there have been times when I would love to have <br/>\nsome quiet time before going to bed and I wish she would just <br/>\ngo to sleep but......I have never put her in her bed/crib and let her <br/>\nscream until she went to sleep.  My SIL won&#39;t even consider <br/>\ngetting Linzie a &quot;big girl&quot; bed because then she would be able to <br/>\nclimb out and get out of her room (she has told me this, in those <br/>\nexact words).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo....last night I had had enough (I may not be welcome there for <br/>\na while).  My SIL put dinner in front of Linzie (beans, weiners and <br/>\npeas and carrots).  Linzie ate some of it but only a bite or two and <br/>\nthen started yelling &quot;bite, bite.&quot;  My SIL was ignoring her, as <br/>\nusual, so I asked what she wanted.  My SIL said that Linzie <br/>\nwanted tomatoes.  She had eated a couple (the small cherry <br/>\nones) already and wanted some more.  Ok.....so get her some <br/>\nmore, what&#39;s the problem?  I looked at my SIL and said &quot;so, why <br/>\ndon&#39;t you give her some more tomatoes, it&#39;s not like she&#39;s asking <br/>\nfor chips and dip for heaven&#39;s sake, it&#39;s TOMATOES!!&quot;   Her <br/>\nresponse was because she&#39;s already eaten some and she <br/>\nneeds to eat everything else on her plate and then she can have <br/>\nsome more.  OMG!  If the poor child wants some damn tomatoes <br/>\nand not peas and carrots, get her the damn tomatoes.  Of <br/>\ncourse, then Linzie and my SIL get in a screaming match and <br/>\nLinzie has to go to a time out.  All because she wanted to eat <br/>\nextra tomatoes at dinner time.  It was really very sad, I think. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I left feeling frustrated and angry and so was Linzie.  To <br/>\ntop it all off, she had to go to bed hungry and screaming.  I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t even stay after that.  I know that sometimes it feels like a <br/>\nstruggle to get kids to eat &quot;healthy&quot; but, it&#39;s tomates we&#39;re talking <br/>\nabout not cookies and ice cream.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74945,"nextTopicId":7876}}
