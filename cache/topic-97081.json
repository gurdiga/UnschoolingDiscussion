It deals with the programming that school (and society/family etc...) gives you.  Actually, if you can devour any of his books I&#39;d suggest it!  His books are usually financially geared, but they are very interesting and deal with the mindset that we are programmed with from school.  His book &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot; is excellent as well and shows the difference between his biological father (&quot;Poor Dad&quot;) who was a public school teacher, etc... and his best friend&#39;s dad and his financial mentor (&quot;Rich Dad&quot;) who did not have the education his biological father had.  <br/>\n<br/>\n:)  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
