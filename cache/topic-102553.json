Just like when I finally let go of candy restrictions.  It wasn&#39;t that I had them, it was that I stopped buying my daughter (7) candy whenever she asked.  I said she could buy it with her allowance.  Then it turned into something she was spending her money on, usually the first thing.  So, I decided that wasn&#39;t such a good idea and the next time we went to Sam&#39;s, I told her she could pick out anything she wanted.  She chose 5 lbs of Mike & Ikes and 3 lbs of Laffie Taffie.  She ate a lot of it at first, but she also shared a lot of it with her friends.  We bought that stuff back in late September.  There&#39;s still a bunch of it in the pantry.  At Halloween, she could care less how much candy she got and it sat around for a long time untouched.  When things are readily available, in all areas of life, they are not coveted.<br/>\n<br/>\n  :o)<br/>\n  Nichole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yahoo!

Gaining utility is the reason why a person buys a <br/>\nproduct or engages in an activity. Just like businesses make decisions <br/>\nin such a way as to maximize total profits, individuals make decisions <br/>\nin such a way as to maximize their &quot;total utility.&quot; Economists view <br/>\npeople as &quot;utility-maximizing&quot; agents. Through an economist&#39;s eyes, <br/>\nwe&#39;re all going through our lives making constant comparisons - <br/>\nchoosing minute-by-minute what to do, what to eat, what to buy, what to <br/>\nwear, what to say, and everything else, and every time we choose, we do <br/>\nit so as to increase our total utility as much as possible. Imagine you <br/>\nare standing in an ice cream store and choosing a flavor - what an <br/>\neconomist sees is that your brain is rapidly going through all the <br/>\nchoices, figuring out how much utility you&#39;d gain from a scoop of <br/>\nstrawberry versus a scoop of rocky road and so on, and then picking the <br/>\none that gives you the most utility. (Notice that utility has to be <br/>\npredicted - we could be wrong in our pick, but we do our best given the <br/>\ninformation we have. I could decide that strawberry is my pick for <br/>\ntoday - that&#39;s the flavor that I prefer right now - the one that will <br/>\ngive me the most utility. And then I might discover, to my dismay, that <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t live up to my expectations and I might WISH I could change <br/>\nmy mind. It happens. So, our choices are actually based on our <br/>\n&quot;expected&quot; utility gains.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay - there is a lot more I could say about &quot;utility&quot; and if you have <br/>\nobjections to this way of seeing the world, we can talk about them. <br/>\nBut, I&#39;ll leave that for later, and, after introducing one more idea, <br/>\nI&#39;ll move on to what this has to do with children and <br/>\ntelevision-watching restrictions.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, imagine you&#39;re in that ice cream shop and you&#39;ve bought that <br/>\nstrawberry cone because it had a high utility value to you. You eat it <br/>\nup and it is delicious and you compute the expected utility of ANOTHER <br/>\nice cream cone and decide to buy one. You eat it. YUM. Now you compute <br/>\nthe expected utility of a third ice cream cone. So - what do you think? <br/>\nIs the 2nd ice cream cone going to give you as much ADDITIONAL utility <br/>\nas the 1st did? Will the 3rd one be expected to add as much to your <br/>\ntotal utility as the 1st or 2nd ones did? What&#39;s going to happen as you <br/>\neat more ice cream cones? After you&#39;ve had one, the expected utility of <br/>\nthe next is lower than the expected utility was for the first. And <br/>\nafter you&#39;ve had two, the expected utility for the third will be lower <br/>\nthan the expected utility for the second one was. They still might have <br/>\nvalue to you, they still give you utility, just not as much extra <br/>\nutility.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;extra&quot; utility you get from having &quot;one more&quot; of something, is <br/>\ncalled &quot;marginal utility.&quot;<br/>\nAnd - marginal utility goes DOWN as you have more and more of the same <br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nEVEN if you chose different flavors for each of your ice cream cones, <br/>\nyou&#39;d have chosen the highest-utility flavor first and so subsequent <br/>\ncones would provide lower and lower marginal utility.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis way of looking at choices is applicable to almost everything we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s your favorite thing to do? Watch movies? Read a book? Garden? Go <br/>\nto Disneyland? Why don&#39;t you just do THAT all the time and nothing <br/>\nelse? I mean - if it is your favorite, then doesn&#39;t IT give you higher <br/>\nutility than anything else. Why do you ever stop doing it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer is that as you do more and more of something, the marginal <br/>\nutility of doing even more of it, goes down. As its marginal utility <br/>\ngoes down, other things start to look better and better.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut - when you restrict an activity, you keep the person at the point <br/>\nwhere the marginal utility is really high.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you only allow a limited amount of tv, then the marginal utility <br/>\nof a little more tv is high and EVERY other option looks like a poor <br/>\none, comparatively.  Watching more tv becomes the focus of the person&#39;s <br/>\nthinking, since the marginal utility is so high. Relax the constraints <br/>\nand, after a period of adjustment and experimentation to determine <br/>\naccurate marginal utilities, the focus on tv will disappear and it will <br/>\nbecome just another option.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] TV detox","postDate":"1105634545","msgId":102557,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFCMjEyNTBGLTY1ODItMTFEOS04MTY0LTAwMEE5NTdFRkU0NkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNzNjY2OStqMTc2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNzNjY2OStqMTc2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":102553,"nextInTopic":102559,"prevInTime":102556,"nextInTime":102558,"topicId":102553,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I  have gone through myriad <br/>\nemotions about what letting go of control looks like and how I feel about the results.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the following occurred:<br/>\n<br/>\nJust last week, the TV was on in the morning again (it&#39;s on most of the <br/>\nday here as TV or X Box) and I sometimes will say, &quot;Can we take a TV break? I&#39;m tired of <br/>\nthe noise.&quot; They usually oblige me, but it&#39;s never their idea. Which was fine. I have <br/>\naccepted that they like TV a lot more than I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell on this particular day, Jacob said, &quot;Can we turn the TV off and just have classical <br/>\nmusic on?&quot; Caitrin and Liam said, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m sick of TV.&quot; Since that day, we&#39;ve had the TV <br/>\noff almost every morning by their choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s taken two years for that to happen that way. Two whole total years of non-<br/>\ninterference.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey still watch TV. They still love TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it struck me how long it took for them to make a comment like that on their own with <br/>\nno prompting from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would make it appear that my goal was for them to stop watching TV. Not at all. But I <br/>\ndid wonder about that &quot;TV is just one more option&quot; thing that I thought was more <br/>\ncharacteristic of unschooling families.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it turns out, we had controlled TV for the first 15 years of my oldest son&#39;s life (and then <br/>\nthe corresponding amount in each of the younger ones) and my oldest said once, &quot;We have <br/>\nto much to catch up on to get all the jokes with our friends.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI now understand that. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I&#39;d share our process since I had thought it would only take eight months for <br/>\nthat moment to occur. :) But nope! 24 months, almost to the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie~~off to watch some TV</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102584,"nextTopicId":102487}}
