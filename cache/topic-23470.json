These are the parents who know how to get things done with administrators.&quot; <br/>\n So, if we were putting our kids in a private school it would be ok? When my children were in public school, I was looked upon as the pest by the administration, because I would not keep my mouth shut when I disagreed with something. This statement assumes homeschoolers are more afffluent than public school parents and I believe that has been proved otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as the most committed parents leave, the schools may falter more, giving the larger community yet another reason to fret over their condition. <br/>\nIt is our responsibility to ensure everyone gets a fair education? I thought that is why public schools were started in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe softening economy may also begin to thin the ranks of home schoolers, many of whom are middle-class families that can&#39;t afford private schools; if stay-at-home teaching parents have to take a job, free public school will start to look very inviting. <br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the Federal Government, up to three-quarters of the families that home school today say they do so primarily because, like so many of us, they are worried about the quality of their children&#39;s education.<br/>\nAccording to the first statement, finances will change our mind, but the second states homeschoolers motivation is quality of education. Make up your mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut imagine what American public education would look like if parents who currently home school flooded their local schools with all that mighty dedication instead. One doesn&#39;t diminish a home-schooling parent&#39;s sacrifice for his child to note that he may also be abdicating some of his responsibilities to his community.<br/>\nI thought one of my greatest responsibilities to the community was to raise up responsible children who know how to give back to the community instead of destroy it.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn 1992 psychotherapist Larry Shyers did a study while at the University of Florida in which he closely examined the behavior of 35 home schoolers and 35 public schoolers. He found that home schoolers were generally more patient and less competitive. They tended to introduce themselves to one another more; they didn&#39;t fight as much. And the home schoolers were much more prone to exchange addresses and phone numbers. In short, they behaved like miniature adults. <br/>\nSo, according to this psychotherapist, patience, communication and respect for other people are undesirable traits in children? Do they have to act rude, competitive and combatative with one another to be considered &quot;normal&quot;? <br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;There&#39;s something very efficient about [traditional] schooling, and home schooling isn&#39;t exactly efficient.&quot; <br/>\nIf I had $3000.+ per student to spend, My children would have a much more &quot;efficient&quot; education than the public school could ever give them.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo many public school administrators silently agree with what Wayne Johnson, president of the California Teachers Association, says in objecting to any public expenditure on home schoolers: &quot;Putting money into home schooling is throwing money down a rathole. You have no idea if that money is being spent properly or children are benefiting.&quot; <br/>\nThats funny, I feel that way about public education...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJohanna <br/>\nLife is the ultimate learning experience!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23449,"nextTopicId":23435}}
