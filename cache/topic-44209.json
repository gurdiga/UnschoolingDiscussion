The<br/>\nlittle things we all do sometimes like counting to 3 very slowly or taking a<br/>\ndeep breath, walking away, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is also 6, and one thing that has helped him was learning to see his<br/>\n&quot;triggers&quot; and how to cope when he feels the meltdown coming.  After a<br/>\nnumber of times of going through what happened with him afterwards, he<br/>\nlearned to identify the point where he felt overwhelmed, and eventually we<br/>\ncould come up with things to do differently next time.  It&#39;s helped, though<br/>\nnot for every situation, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s any consolation, I&#39;m finding 6 a lot easier than 5....maybe she&#39;s en<br/>\nroute to outgrowing it....!<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44137,"nextTopicId":44210}}
