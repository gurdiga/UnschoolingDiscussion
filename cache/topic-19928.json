The driver rolled down his window <br/>\nand said, &quot;If you get in the car, I&#39;ll give you ten dollars and a <br/>\npiece of candy.&quot;  The boy refused and kept on walking. <br/>\n<br/>\nA few moments later, refusing to take, &quot;no&quot; for an answer, <br/>\nthe man driving the car pulled over again.  &quot;How about twenty <br/>\ndollars and two pieces of candy?&quot;  The boy told the man to leave <br/>\nhim alone and kept walking. <br/>\n<br/>\nStill further down the road the man pulled over to the side of <br/>\nthe road and said, &quot;Okay, this is my final offer.  I&#39;ll give you <br/>\nfifty dollars and all the candy you can eat.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe little boy stopped, walked up to the car, leaned into the <br/>\nwindow and said, &quot;Look, you bought the piece-of-junk, Dad. <br/>\nYou&#39;ll have to live with it.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19926,"nextTopicId":19828}}
