As those who&#39;ve read my book know, I am a Quaker, and<br/>\nwe take, as our very first principle, that there is the light of God (Christian<br/>\nFriends,  call it &quot;the light of Christ&quot;) within every person, and that this<br/>\nlight was planted in us by God Him(Her) Self so that we might seek out the good,<br/>\neach through our own experience, and each in our own way.  People seek that<br/>\nwhich is True in their own ways because it was ordained by the Truth itself that<br/>\nthey do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you can see that, if you watch and witness, in your children.  They have no<br/>\nneed of our God talk, and our Holy Books -- these are, after all, but tools, and<br/>\nthey become weapons -- sometimes deadly -- when we use them against each other<br/>\n-- but they seek -- it is built into who they are from their very births.  I<br/>\ncall this &quot;original seeking&quot; -- and unlike concepts of original sin or original<br/>\nvirtue -- every mother and every father can see it with their own eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur children are witnessing to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert<br/>\n--<br/>\n&quot;If you love being stopped mid-page by powerful observations that strike your<br/>\nmind like little explosions of light, get this book.&quot;-Home Education Magazine.<br/>\nTo read reviewer or reader comments, or the foreword from &quot;And the Skylark Sings<br/>\nwith Me&quot;, and to order, check out the new website: www.skylarksings.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6571,"nextTopicId":6569}}
