I like <br/>\nSturbridge better than Plymoth Plantation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go to the Cape, you could go to Woods Hole (near Falmouth) <br/>\nOceanographic Museum and Aquarium.  The Aquarium is free and has a hands-on <br/>\nsection for picking up crabs etc. and looking at them under microscopes.  <br/>\nThey also feed the seals 2x a day there.  There is also a nice garden <br/>\noverlooking the water a few blocks from the aquarium with a Bell Tower (part <br/>\nof Catholic church across the street) and a small wooden playground up the <br/>\nstreet.   Email me if you want more info.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go to Hyannis, the Cape Cod Potato Chip Factory there had a <br/>\nself-guided tour and a free bag of chips.  My kids really liked it!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book store above is awesome!  I love the remainder rooms (books marked <br/>\ndown)!  And the rest of the store is about 20% off retail.    <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone else mentioned Curious George Goes To Wordsworth bookstore in Harvard <br/>\nSquare, Cambridge.  A wonderful store and you could go to the Mount Auburn <br/>\nCemetery in Cambrige too.  Lots of beautiful trees, headstones, famous people <br/>\nburied there (self-guided tour info too).   There is a tower with a great <br/>\nview too.   If you go there, just a mile or so down the street is East <br/>\nWatertown and lots of little Armenian and Greek shops/bakeries.  Yum!  Massis <br/>\nBakery, Sepal&#39;s Restaurant, and others.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps, <br/>\n~Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n«·.,¸¸,.·´¯`·.,¸¸,.·´¯`·.»§«(¨`v´¨).»§«·.,¸¸,.·´¯`·.,¸¸,.·´¯`·.»<br/>\n                                 ` v´<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of <br/>\ninstruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiousity of inquiry; <br/>\nfor this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need <br/>\nof freedom.&quot;<br/>\n-- Albert Einstein <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41273,"nextTopicId":41277}}
