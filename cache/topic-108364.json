A few weeks ago we mailed out invitations to family and a few of his kid friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nSIL calls and leaves a message on the machine.  It both saddened me and angered me at the same time.  I&#39;ve posted about this SIL in the past -- she was a die-hard school at homer (who claimed to be &#39;relaxed&#39; but was anything but) who feels obedience is the word of the day -- parents dictate and kids obey.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, she has 2 kids, ages 14 & 15.  My son wanted to invite their whole family, and the invitation was addressed as such.  They recently moved here from out of state.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer message stated:  Sorry we won&#39;t be able to attend the party.  H & C both have extracurricular activities on Sat.  I know the party is Sunday, but I don&#39;t think they are really interested in attending a 7-yr-old&#39;s party and that they would be bored.  I think maybe the younger cousins would have a better time there.  Thanks for asking.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the....???  Since when does AGE matter with family??  I was so stunned I didn&#39;t even reply.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, my son&#39;s best friend is 12, and he&#39;s 7.  What does age have to do with anything??<br/>\n<br/>\nCall me flabberghasted....<br/>\n<br/>\nJanet<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108369,"nextTopicId":108159}}
