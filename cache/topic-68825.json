It was called With the Door Open: My Experience.  A <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; passage from it has always stayed with me:<br/>\n&gt;     “The most comprehensive formula for human culture which I know was <br/>\n&gt; given by <br/>\n&gt; the old peasant who, on his deathbed, obtained from his son this one <br/>\n&gt; promise: to sit every day for a half an hour ALONE in the best room.  The <br/>\n&gt; son did this and became a model for the whole district.  This father’s <br/>\n&gt; command has take thought for everything, for Eternity, soul-deepening, <br/>\n&gt; refinement, history.”<br/>\n&gt;     I’ve thought a good deal about the meaning of that passage.  When I see <br/>\n&gt; a <br/>\n&gt; baby quietly staring at his or her hands….or a toddler off in a corner <br/>\n&gt; putting something into a cup and then taking it out, over and over again… <br/>\n&gt; or <br/>\n&gt; a preschooler lying in the grass daydreaming… I like to think that they, in <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; their own ways, are “alone in the best room” of their houses, using the <br/>\n&gt; solitude they need to find the courage to grow.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You know, this moved me deeply, and I thank you for sharing it, Jennifer.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad was a Class-A jerk in many ways, but as is true of a lot of abusive <br/>\npeople, he had his deep and charming side as well.  I tend to focus on his <br/>\nnegatives and forget the many positive things he gave me.  I wonder if he <br/>\nread Anker-Larsen?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have early memories of a *Thinking Bench* right outside our back door when <br/>\nI was little -- about 5.  Daddy used to make me sit there every day.  I hated <br/>\nit at first, and felt like I was being punished, but I wasn&#39;t.  This was <br/>\nnever related to punishment at all (he had much more creative ways of doing <br/>\nthat.)  I don&#39;t know how long I was required to sit.  It was likely too long <br/>\nfor a 5 year old, but it still worked its magic on me, over time.  I found <br/>\ninner stillness on that bench.  I had my first experiences of BEING.  Even I <br/>\nrecognized that it was a prfound experience, although I certainly didn&#39;t use <br/>\nthat word when I thought of it -- it was just a magical time for me.  <br/>\nRemembering it still is.  Being taught the value of solitude at such a young <br/>\nand highly impressionable age.  I KNOW this changed me.  What a gift.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68699,"nextTopicId":68827}}
