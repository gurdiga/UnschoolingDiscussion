They <br/>\nsaid their daughter&#39;s the only non-Indian kid at Laguna/Acoma high school.  <br/>\nThey used to homeschool, but she&#39;s really liking that school.  They said they <br/>\nwere a little worried about what she might be missing.  I said she was <br/>\nmissing NOTHING, but gaining something others couldn&#39;t get for any amount of <br/>\nmoney or study.   I asked if she was hanging out at the pueblos and getting <br/>\ninvited to feasts.  Oh yeah, they said, just lately a deer dance.  Well there <br/>\ny&#39;go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI met them because Holly and I found a crate of books on the road.  They were <br/>\nelementary  music-teacher things.  I wouldn&#39;t have minded having some of <br/>\nthat, if they were unclaimed.  Lots of recorder and guitar and keyboard <br/>\nstuff!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I went through looking for a name, found a photocopy of a receipt for her <br/>\nhaving bought some guitars, and called the number thinking it was someone in <br/>\nthe neighborhood.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, their car had been stolen at gunpoint from their house that morning at <br/>\n4:00 a.m. and the state police had assured them the guy had gone south.  Huh. <br/>\n Apparently he went EAST, and for some reason gently set her crate of <br/>\nteacher-stuff out in the road a couple of blocks from my house.  The state <br/>\npolice wanted to take the crate for evidence and I talked them out of it.  At <br/>\nleast they got something back that way.  My winning argument was I was pretty <br/>\nsure car thieves weren&#39;t going through seeing if any of those books were <br/>\nworth selling at the used book store, so they weren&#39;t going to find any <br/>\nfingerprints but mine, and meanwhile she wouldn&#39;t have the stuff she needed <br/>\nfor her job.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften the best stories happen when people are not trying to be part of good <br/>\nstories.

They had math.  They had grammar with a vengeance.  They had <br/>\nscience fiction, medieval heraldry, and Gilbert and Sullivan. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat was all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDerek, though, came to be hanging out with me, and I could almost say not a <br/>\nthing that he didn&#39;t look quizzical about.

Zip.  He knew less about Christianity than people <br/>\nwill learn walking through a mall because he had  never walked through a mall.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I used to tell him stories.  He wasn&#39;t embarrassed to ask me.  So I showed <br/>\nhim how to use a Bible to look things up.  Showed him the concordance and the <br/>\nlist of Bible books.  Told him the stories of Jacob and Esau, and of Job, and <br/>\nshowed him where to read them whole.  Told him about The Tower of Babel.<br/>\n<br/>\nHOW could he have missed all that?
