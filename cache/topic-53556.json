Just like I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t hand a toddler a sharp knife to use, I wouldn&#39;t introduce anything<br/>\nto my kids that I didn&#39;t feel good about.  So when the little kids are<br/>\naround, I make sure that I am listening to music, reading books, watching<br/>\nmovies that I feel good about exposing my kids to.  Now as the older kids<br/>\nhave gotten older, they are more &quot;out in the world&quot; and know about artists,<br/>\nmovies, etc. that wouldn&#39;t be my first choice for them.  I do tell the kids<br/>\nhow I feel about it, what my concerns are.  Sometimes the kids agree,<br/>\nsometimes they don&#39;t.  If the kids still want to watch or listen to<br/>\nsomething that I have my doubts about, I watch it with them to make sure<br/>\nthey are handling it ok.  Then I quit worrying and try to remember that I<br/>\nhave very different tastes from my parents even today as an adult and that<br/>\nis certainly ok.  And the kids have NEVER consistently watched or listened<br/>\nto anything that seemed to have a negative effect on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie--the other one</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53328,"nextTopicId":53457}}
