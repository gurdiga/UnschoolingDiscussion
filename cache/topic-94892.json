(one can hope ;o)<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t read *all* the responses....just don&#39;t have the time....so <br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this particular concept has been discussed or not.  <br/>\nBut for what it&#39;s worth...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe figured out, over a period of time, approximately how much we <br/>\nwere spending on our child&#39;s wants....toys, video games and <br/>\nequipment, special snacks, etc.  It turned out to be quite a hefty <br/>\nchunk of money!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, instead of fretting over every expenditure, whether or not we <br/>\nwere really spending *too* much on him, and not giving him a good <br/>\nexperience as far as the value of money, etc., we decided to give <br/>\nhim a rather large allowance, since we were spending that much <br/>\nanyway, and let him learn by experience how to budget his money.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first, it was kind of awful, because the money went right through <br/>\nhis fingers, and it was gone when he wanted something later in the <br/>\nweek, and he was used to us buying whatever he needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut with consistency, he learned to be patient and wait for &#39;payday&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then there came a time when he *had* to have &#39;EyeToy&#39; (a <br/>\nwonderful interactive video game than engages the entire body!)  And <br/>\nsince we (the &#39;bank&#39;) thought that would be a really good <br/>\nexpenditure, we &#39;loaned&#39; him the money, wrote up a contract where he <br/>\ncould pay back a certain amount each week.  But one of the <br/>\nstipulations of the contract was that he would also put aside a <br/>\ncertain amount each week into &#39;savings&#39;, in case he ran up against <br/>\nthis same problem in the future and needed something his budget <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all sat down together with the contract I had written, and <br/>\ndiscussed what it all means, and showed him what all the different <br/>\ncolumns in the ledger I had made were for, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI watched as he literally sort of &#39;puffed up&#39; with pride....that he <br/>\nhas some power in all of this, and that he has decisions to make, <br/>\nand that his decisions will be respected, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all signed and dated the contract, after making sure everyone <br/>\nunderstood what it all meant.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn interesting thing has happened since we began this almost two <br/>\nmonths ago.  He has become *very* generous.  He wants to spend some <br/>\nof his money on mom and dad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt first, I had a problem with this, because I didn&#39;t want him <br/>\nspending his money on us.  But after some thought, I graciously <br/>\naccepted his gifts to me with much pleasure, knowing that generosity <br/>\nis also a very valuable life lesson.  Learning to &#39;budget&#39; our <br/>\ngenerosity is something that has to be considered.  We can become <br/>\ngenerous to a fault, which can also get us into a lot of trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis began to lead into discussions of other areas of generosity.  <br/>\nGenerosity of time spent together, generosity of affections, and so <br/>\nmuch more. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt just seems that once we got the &#39;money monster&#39; (speaking of <br/>\nthe &#39;monster&#39; of money management ;o) under control, our lives have <br/>\nbecome so much more pleasant!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94798,"nextTopicId":94777}}
