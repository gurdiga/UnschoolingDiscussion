We&#39;ve began a co-op of sorts with a neighbor for her son. <br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s been kicked out of school and was being sent to an alternative <br/>\n&gt; school. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This advice is for you or for your neighbor?  Are the parents actually <br/>\nplanning on Unschooling the boy?  If not, the advice on this list <br/>\nprobably doesn&#39;t apply.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Someone did state that it would take at least a month for him to &quot;come <br/>\n&gt; around.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Deschooling is often said to take a minimum of one month for every year <br/>\nthat a person is in school.  I would guess that the harder school was on <br/>\na person, the longer that period of time could be (and being kicked out <br/>\nwould definitely be considered hard on a person).  The time starts over <br/>\ncompletely whenever any schoolishness is forced on a person (including <br/>\nco-ops in a lot of cases!).  So, for a 14 year old that was having <br/>\nproblems in school, I&#39;d give him at least a year and a half for <br/>\ndeschooling.  I&#39;d buy (or rent or borrow) a bunch of videos and books <br/>\nand games and leave them around the house.  I&#39;d spend as many of my <br/>\nwaking hours as possible right with him.  I&#39;d talk to him, and leave him <br/>\nalone if he wanted to be alone (with frequent checking up on him -- to <br/>\ngive him food, mention a cool show on tv, point out the weather, etc. -- <br/>\njust random cool things that would interest a person).  I&#39;d stay open <br/>\nand available to him.  I&#39;d apologize to him for all that he has been <br/>\nthrough in his years in school.  I&#39;d emphasize that he is not a failure! <br/>\n  School failed him, not the other way around.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are his interests and hobbies?  I&#39;m going to stereotype and just <br/>\nguess that perhaps he likes skateboarding and music and video games? <br/>\nHelp him do those things more.  Enjoy him and celebrate his newfound <br/>\nfreedom.  Have a party -- a NEVER BACK TO SCHOOL party.  Take him <br/>\nshopping (if he likes that sort of thing).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lisa in AZ</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175556378,"authorName":"Denise Thomas","from":"Denise Thomas &lt;denisedthomas@...&gt;","profile":"denisedthomas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Suggestions with a 14 Year old...","postDate":"1129349917","msgId":108958,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMDE1MDQxODM3LjY0OTgxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxNDA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGM0LjMxZmViNzY5LjMwODEzYWFjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":108955,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":108957,"nextInTime":108959,"topicId":108903,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t know the book personally, but would the teenage liberation handbook be appropriate for him?

We all need that down time. Babies get fussy when overstimulated, three year-olds scream at the grocery store when they have been hauled all over, running errands all day, fourteen year-olds need private alone time, so do adults. We can&#39;t expect every minute of the &#39;school&#39; time frame to be filled with &#39;unschooling&#39; activities, that is not how it works. You aren&#39;t replacing one for the other, you are getting rid of one and going on with your life. Two weeks isn&#39;t enough time for anyone of any age to &#39;get it&#39;. He probably isn&#39;t going to want to do anything for a time except just be.
