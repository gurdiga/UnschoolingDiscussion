If you&#39;re really *that* curious to see what&#39;s there, please <br/>\n&gt;save everything before clicking the link. *virulent - highly <br/>\n&gt;infective, rapidly spreading, deadly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This message is on our website at<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/badurl.html.\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/badurl.html.</a> We will post any updates <br/>\n&gt;and additional information on that page.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A little history: We created the home-ed-press.com domain name when<br/>\n&gt;we were publishing books on homeschooling several years ago. We sold <br/>\n&gt;the book publishing part of our company when we decided to focus on <br/>\n&gt;the magazine, but we kept the home-ed-press.com URL mirrored to our <br/>\n&gt;home-ed-magazine.com site because so many homeschooling websites <br/>\n&gt;showed to the old URL &lt;home-ed-press.com&gt; as their link to Home <br/>\n&gt;Education Magazine&#39;s many features and free services.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But somehow the registration on the home-ed-press.com domain name<br/>\n&gt;expired (we&#39;re still trying to figure out how it expired without our <br/>\n&gt;knowledge), and it was bought by a wholesale company, which leased or <br/>\n&gt;rented it just last week to an overseas company which linked it to a <br/>\n&gt;porn site, obviously to capitalize on the high number of links.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So here we are, with a big mess on our hands: A widely linked<br/>\n&gt;homeschooling URL linked to a gnarly pornography site. We are working <br/>\n&gt;to straighen out the mess, but we need help. All the help we can get.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;PLEASE - If you have a link to the old home-ed-press domain name on<br/>\n&gt;your website please change it to home-ed-magazine.com as soon as <br/>\n&gt;possible. Please check the sites for your local homeschooling support <br/>\n&gt;group, your local public library, your favorite online resources - <br/>\n&gt;anyplace that might have a link to Home Education Magazine&#39;s hundreds <br/>\n&gt;of pages via the old home-ed-press.com URL.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Webmasters: We offer the following advice from Ann Zeise, who first<br/>\n&gt;notified us of this problem:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Here&#39;s how to find out if you have any home-ed-press links on your<br/>\n&gt;site. Go to the search engine at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.altavista.com\">http://www.altavista.com</a> In the <br/>\n&gt;search field put the following parameters (exchanging my <br/>\n&gt;www.gomilpitas.com URL for your own root directory in the last part):<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;+link:www.home-ed-press.com<br/>\n&gt;-url:www.home-ed-press.com+url:www.gomilpitas.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If your site shows up at all on Altavista, you will be able to see if<br/>\n&gt;any pages have the errant URL on them. Then just go into your copy of <br/>\n&gt;these pages and do a &quot;&quot;FIND and REPLACE&quot; and replace <br/>\n&gt;&quot;www.home-ed-press.com&quot; with &quot;www.home-ed-magazine.com&quot; -- They kept <br/>\n&gt;all the rest of the directories and paths the same, so your link will <br/>\n&gt;now go to its original destination. (Do check in case you just happen <br/>\n&gt;to have a link to a page they have removed for some reason. All of <br/>\n&gt;mine were corrected this way.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;NOTE: using the first two parameters in this sort of search is a good<br/>\n&gt;way to find out who is linking to you. Just put in your own URL after <br/>\n&gt;&quot;+link:&quot; and &quot;-url:&quot;.   -Ann Zeise<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please forward this notice to homeschooling and alternative education<br/>\n&gt;email lists, online newsletter editors, support group lists, <br/>\n&gt;educational reference lists - anyplace Home Education Magazine&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;award-winning website might be linked.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This message is on our website at<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/badurl.html.\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/badurl.html.</a> We will post any updates <br/>\n&gt;and additional information on that page.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thank you for whatever you can do to help!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mark and Helen Hegener, Publishers<br/>\n&gt;Home Education Magazine<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM@...\">HEM@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Goddess Garden~ Where Herbs are our Heartsong~<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.demetria.com\">http://www.demetria.com</a><br/>\nHeart of Herbs<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.heartofherbs.com\">http://www.heartofherbs.com</a><br/>\nHerbal Correspondence, Apprenticeships and Workshops<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20758,"nextTopicId":20762}}
