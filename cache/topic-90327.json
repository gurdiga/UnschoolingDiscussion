What makes you<br/>\nmost uncomfortable?  Pay attention to the language you<br/>\nuse, and the feelings that you have.  How does that<br/>\nserve you now, does it still work for you, and make<br/>\nsense to you, or is it just habit? <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the other side of that, is, what first appealed to<br/>\nyou about unschooling?  What is it that you liked so<br/>\nmuch you really became ready to start letting go of<br/>\nall those beliefs?  Those are important guideposts.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe point here is to make it &quot;your own&quot;, right?, and<br/>\nthat means reading, discussion, and thought, and lots<br/>\nof time to do those things! It might mean that some of<br/>\nwhat you read in a book or read on this list doesn&#39;t<br/>\nfit quite right right away and that&#39;s ok. You have<br/>\nidentified a blindspot and that&#39;s good.  Try not to<br/>\nget judgmental and keep searching for *what it is* you<br/>\nhave a problem with.  Someimes that is very hard to<br/>\ndo, read thru the archives and you&#39;ll see many others<br/>\nstruggle with it too! <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I know with <br/>\ntime I will become more comfortable with presenting<br/>\nmyself honestly to the world but I am not there yet<br/>\nand am not sure how to become comfortable.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice:  Stay open to learning.  Get used to not<br/>\nknowing *all* the answers, but getting to know BETTER,<br/>\nevery day, what&#39;s right for you, and your kids!  <br/>\n  <br/>\n&lt;&lt; I know much of my discomfort is disliking anyone<br/>\nnot to approve <br/>\nof me.  I would value any insights you can give me.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, man, I know what that is like.  lol  My only<br/>\nadvice is, push thru the discomfort to stand up for<br/>\nyourself, and you might do it poorly at first, but<br/>\nthat&#39;s ok, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing yet! ( My<br/>\nvoice used to shake, and so did my hands!) <br/>\n<br/>\n Practice!  Do it with strangers, people you&#39;ll never<br/>\nsee again, and don&#39;t care (as much) about. Practice in<br/>\nfront of your mirror when your nervous about an<br/>\nupcoming situation, or role play with your husband or<br/>\nan understanding friend, whatever works.  You&#39;ll start<br/>\nto feel more confident as you pay more attention to<br/>\nreal life, and not &quot;what they MIGHT think&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Also, what do your kids answer when people ask them<br/>\nwhat grade they&#39;re <br/>\nin or about school?  My kids don&#39;t feel like we do<br/>\nschool so are lost <br/>\nwhen strangers ask about it.  Thanks again for your<br/>\ninput.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is ruthless. lol They ask, what grade are you<br/>\nin and he simply says, &quot;I don&#39;t go to school.&quot;  He<br/>\nusually gives them a look like, &quot;Go ahead, ask me<br/>\nanother stupid question.&quot;  lol<br/>\n<br/>\n  There&#39;s usually dead silence while the other person<br/>\ntries to figure out how that could possibly be!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it amazes us how ignorant people are about<br/>\nhomeschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, I usually feel sorry for the person and<br/>\nI tell them his age, ( or he does) and that if he were<br/>\nto be in school, he might be in 4th, but that he&#39;s<br/>\nhomeschooled, and that we don&#39;t measure his<br/>\nintelligence in grades.  There&#39;s usually more dead<br/>\nsilence at this point.  lol <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just my POV about the subject line of your<br/>\npost.

I talk about how the life we are living now is an investment for<br/>\nwhen Jayn is a teenager. I know that it is primarily about being happy and<br/>\nfulfilled today, but other people are sometimes reassured that we are at<br/>\nleast thinking about the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

My kids are still relatively young (7,6,4,3,3).  I was following a CM approach and have abandoned it for the second time.

There&#39;s a driving force inside us that says we *need* to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; make them understand so they can stop thinking bad thoughts about us and our<br/>\n&gt;&gt; families and our choices.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; But if someone can let go of the emotions questioning stirs up -- not<br/>\n&gt;&gt; necessarily not feel the emotions but let the emotions exist, accept them,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; but detach ourselves from the control they try to weild over us -- a person<br/>\n&gt;&gt; can get to a healthier place.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; If someone questions us we can choose to give them information or not<br/>\n&gt;&gt; depending on whether it seems a useful use of our time or not. But if we can<br/>\n&gt;&gt; accept that their emotions and reactions and mental place aren&#39;t ours to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; control, we can be more at peace with ourselves. We can be at peace with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; doing what we feel is right without taking on the burden of expecting the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; world to change for us and because of us. We&#39;re releasing the information for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; people to use as they will, not expecting a change in anyone in return. They<br/>\n&gt;&gt; are where they are for a reason. We can give them the information to change,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; but it isn&#39;t in our power to change them. It&#39;s entirely their choice to hold<br/>\n&gt;&gt; onto the place they&#39;re in or seek out what they need to get to a new place.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Many people are not going to understand homeschooling. Fewer are going to<br/>\nunderstand unschooling. If they wanted to, they&#39;d reach out and ask<br/>\nquestions. When they attack someone who has the information they need to<br/>\nchange their ignorance to knowledge, they are protecting their own<br/>\nignorance. They&#39;re basically saying it&#39;s scary where you are and I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant that scariness to affect me, so I&#39;m going to do what I can to defend<br/>\nmyself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing we can do about that. They&#39;re making the choice to remain<br/>\nignorant. We can offer the information but we can&#39;t make them take it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we can let go of that need to make them take the information in so they<br/>\ncan understand us, we can let go of the need to defend ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, what do your kids answer when people ask them what grade they&#39;re in or<br/>\n&gt; about school?

We don&#39;t do grades.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOr you can tell them -- if they&#39;re birthdays are in the summer! -- that to<br/>\nfigure out their grade they can subtract 5 from their age and say &quot;We&#39;re<br/>\nhomeschooled but if I were in school I&#39;d be in grade x.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could tell your kids that when people ask what grade the kids are in,<br/>\nthey&#39;re trying to get some information they can relate to.
