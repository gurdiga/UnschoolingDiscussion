The workshops were wonderful, and the place was amazing. <br/>\nJulian was just 8, and he had always pretty much been around an adult most of <br/>\nthe time all his life. There, however, he found things he wanted to do, and <br/>\nmet me at specific times. It was cool, because it felt safe to let him do <br/>\nthat, and he felt good. He spent one whole afternoon in a kayak, and fell in <br/>\nlove.
