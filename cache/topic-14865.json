My son has been making up<br/>\nsymbols and using letters/symbols from other languages such as Egyption<br/>\nand Chinese.  It&#39;s really fun seeing his languages develope.   He has<br/>\nsome awareness of  English rhyming words and how words begin with<br/>\nsimilar letters and asks how words are spelled sometimes.  He writes<br/>\nsome of his letters backwards. He probably has word recognition for<br/>\nabout 100 words.  He&#39;s six years and would be in first grade and be<br/>\nforced to do the traditional way if he was in school, I&#39;m sure glad he&#39;s<br/>\nnot.  Who knows, maybe he&#39;ll be a linguist some day!  I wonder what<br/>\nlanguage he will write today.<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14852,"nextTopicId":9999}}
