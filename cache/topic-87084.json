If I ask him","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1620017212\">I completely agree and have really only been learning that more <br/>\nrecently.  My 5yo ds is really pretty happy playing with anything <br/>\nand on his own.  If I ask him if he wants to do something he usually <br/>\nturns me down.  This could get pretty frustrating, for ME!  LAtely, <br/>\nI just start building with the Legos and he joins in.  We got an art <br/>\ntable for Xmas so everything is more accessbile for him and his <br/>\nbrother.  I also leave our back doors open to the back yard and <br/>\npatio so there is no boundary between the spaces.  They do not have <br/>\nto ask to go out and I do not have to offer.  It is available at <br/>\ntheir leisure.  The weather has been wonderful the last few months <br/>\nhere in south Florida so they have really been enjoying the <br/>\noutside.  Also, if they are glued to the TV sometimes I will just <br/>\noffer playdough or the park or something of the sort and they will <br/>\nchoose that.  Most kids will not choose TV in in spectrum of other <br/>\nthings.  My kids are usually attached to it when I am really busy <br/>\nand they drift up from the playroom.  Sometimes, I just remember to <br/>\nswitch the TV off when they have left it.  I have learned to be <br/>\npretty free with TV time here.  I have found that sometimes they are <br/>\nactively playing and then pass the TV which was left on and BOOM <br/>\nthey are absorbed by it.  If they want to turn it back on, that&#39;s <br/>\nfine but at least that way it is a conscious choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Danielle E.

Do you have him help you make cookies and<br/>\n&gt; go to the store and hang out the laundry and take him<br/>\n&gt; to the park or playground? Are you reading books he<br/>\n&gt; likes to him and washing the puppy and taking long<br/>\n&gt; walks in the woods?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unschooling isn&#39;t about letting the kids go it alone.<br/>\n&gt; It is about freeing them up and helping them discover.<br/>\n&gt;  Unschooling actually seems to take more parental<br/>\n&gt; involvement than school-out-of-a-box homeschooling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just my .02,<br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; --Susan in VA<br/>\n&gt; WifetoVegman<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for<br/>\n&gt; children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school<br/>\n </span></blockquote>than<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now this really helps me think. I have been trying to do more things<br/>\nwith him. Usually I would suggest things and he would just turn me down<br/>\nto watch TV. This Christmas we bought him some board games and set up<br/>\nhis play area for him to use a bit more and he has been asking to play<br/>\nmore. We try to play as much as he wants. <br/>\n<br/>\nBooks, he isn&#39;t into reading yet. I have tried this and there are a<br/>\nselect few that he wants to read, which is fine. He has helped me with<br/>\nlaundry and such before, but its more of a chore for him and he chooses<br/>\nto sit and watch TV instead! Occasionally I DO shut the TV off and then<br/>\nhe is forced to do other things and he enjoys it. It must be that he is<br/>\nso comfortable with doing nothing and just sitting and not thinking. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it still ok to shut it off and &quot;make him&quot; do other things? Should I<br/>\nhave a talk with him about the overuse first? We have tried to tell him<br/>\nwe would like him to do other things, but I get the frowns and attitude.<br/>\nI really don&#39;t feel its healthy for a 6yo to watch as much as he does<br/>\nand vegetate. We also live in a pretty urban area - no woods here!! We<br/>\nhave certain play dates we go to and those days are great for his<br/>\nimagination. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette,Jason<br/>\n& Our 3 Boujas<br/>\nNicolas, Joseph<br/>\n& peanut due 1/12/04</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87368,"nextTopicId":87064}}
