I think that&#39;s ultra important to model for children.<br/>\nI will always do the thing that is most respectful of the people I&#39;m with IF it does not go against my personal beliefs.<br/>\nMoving myself to nurse, does not violate any of my beliefs that my child should have access to the breast on demand. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day, a single male friend helped me drive the kids home after an unschooling function. He was in the house for a few minutes and when Jalen wanted to nurse,I knew it would be a bit uncomfortable for him since it was just he and I in the living room. I just excused myself to the back room and nursed Jalen to sleep. No big deal.<br/>\nIn other situations I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to nurse wherever I was. It all depends. And if it came down to the choice between helping others be comfortable or my child&#39;s comfort, my child wins everytime.
