She then informed her that <br/>\nthe only legal way for her to homeschool is:  1. To be a credentialed <br/>\nteacher  2. Hire a tutor  3. Be enrolled in a private school paying <br/>\ntuition and homeschool through the private school or  4. If R-4 is <br/>\nfiled my friend would then have to charge tuition and educate other <br/>\nchildren too. 5.  Or enroll in Paramont&#39;s school district I.S.P.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know this it totally bogus.  She also told her she was sending her <br/>\na copy of a court case that supports her interpretation of the R-4.  <br/>\nUnfortunatly, she didn&#39;t get the case name or # and we are waiting <br/>\nfor that to come in the mail.  Until then, please left me know all <br/>\ninfo. we can give to this misinformed person.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32063,"nextTopicId":32066}}
