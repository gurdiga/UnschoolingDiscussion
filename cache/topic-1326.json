I&#39;m Liz (45) just<br/>\ncelebrated 27th wedding anniversary with Jac, parents of 6 kids (4-24, 3 of<br/>\neach) grandparents of 1.  I am currently homeschooling 2 of ours, 2 are<br/>\nolder & out of school (well 1 is in college) and 2 are in public school.<br/>\nThe question of the good things about public school draws me into this<br/>\nconversation. I know that this is antedotal and very personal.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 13 yo son is in a special public school that only deals with<br/>\nmultipl-handicapped children birth -21 yrs.  He has cerebal palsy, mental<br/>\nretardation, attention deficit disorder, impulsivity, pervasive<br/>\ndevelopmental delays and AIDS.  We adopted him when he was three and had<br/>\nlived in a hospital all of his life (they told us he wouldn&#39;t live to enter<br/>\nschool.)  The public school is able to offer him activities and equipment<br/>\nthat we could never access.  His needs are so great that I could never<br/>\nhomeschool him and meet the needs of the other children.  However, over the<br/>\nsummer I do see remarkable progress is some areas due to my focus on his<br/>\ndevelopment.  But by the same token, I see remarkable progress during the<br/>\nschool year in other equally important areas due to their ability to work<br/>\nwith him.  His school has a adult child ratio of 6 adults to 1 child (this<br/>\nincludes speech & physical therapists, occupational therapist, councilors,<br/>\nteachers, aids, etc.) So he gets the best of both worlds.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 15 year old daughter is in public high school after 1 1/2 years of<br/>\nhomeschooling.  Her social needs (she is quite an outgoing social<br/>\nbutterfly)are such that I could not involve her in enough outside activities<br/>\nto keep her happy.  She needs to be with lots of people all of othe time in<br/>\norder to be happy.  She is also bi-polar and just to be honest, I couldn&#39;t<br/>\ndeal with her mood swings and constant needs and demands on me.  Once back<br/>\nin public school she and I both became much happier (even though I fought<br/>\nputting her back in school due to academic problems).  She is better able to<br/>\ndeal with multiple instructors and such so much better than she can deal<br/>\nwith one on one instruction and guidance.  I feel that we made a lot of<br/>\nprogress during her time at home and probably could have made more progress<br/>\nif her mental illness had not disrupted the family so severely, that I<br/>\nreally needed the respite from her.  This may sound like a cop out and<br/>\nsometimes I feel that it is, however, it is reality for my family.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I feel that there can never be a blanket answer to the question of what<br/>\nis best for every child or every family.  Each child even within the same<br/>\nfamily really needs to be treated individually and their educational options<br/>\nleft open to meet their needs. I believe that institutionally there is not a<br/>\nlot of good about ps, but individually ps can be good for certain children &<br/>\nfamilies.<br/>\n<br/>\n Even in homeschooling I find that the 2 kids here must be dealt with very<br/>\ndifferently, not just because of the 10 year span in ages, but in learning<br/>\nstyles & needs.  My 4 yo balks at being taught anything, he is more<br/>\ninterested in learning & doing on his own. Unschooling is the answer for his<br/>\neducation. My 14 yo needs structure and much more guidance in her studies<br/>\n(may be due to the 7 years in ps), she isn&#39;t interested in learning for the<br/>\nfun of it.  She hasn&#39;t developed any real outside interests that keep her<br/>\noccupied. TV & rock music are her only interests at this time.  Yes, alot of<br/>\nthis is age appropriate for both kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my $.02.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace, <br/>\nLiz</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1364,"nextTopicId":1376}}
