Not to <br/>\n&gt; be kind<br/>\n&gt; and respectful to our children because they will eventually run into <br/>\n&gt; others<br/>\n&gt; that won&#39;t?<br/>\n&gt; Do you honestly think that our children at a young age will be <br/>\n&gt; equipped the<br/>\n&gt; same in their ability to handle things when they have to be out <br/>\n&gt; working?

Condescension toward anyone, young or old, is<br/>\nwrong.  For some reason here, I&#39;m unable to get through to this group. <br/>\nI&#39;m agreeing with 99.9% of everything you&#39;ve said.  It&#39;s not about<br/>\n&quot;toughening them up&quot; so much as it is preparing them.  But come on,<br/>\nsurviving requires some degree of  &quot;toughening up.&quot;  But I define &quot;tough&quot;<br/>\nmore as being able to deal (or learning to deal) with some of the<br/>\nnot-so-gentle things life sometimes hands us.  What is the harm in a<br/>\nchild learning that others won&#39;t always treat him/her with the same<br/>\nrespect and kindness his/her parents did.  Huh?  I mean, I can look at my<br/>\ngirls and see products of the kindness, respect, love that was given<br/>\nthem, but I can also see that they have the *hutzpah* to deal with the<br/>\ncrap.  I&#39;ll repeat:  I&#39;m on your side; that&#39;s why I&#39;m exploring new ideas<br/>\nin homeschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOK, I&#39;ll try to sit back and &quot;listen&quot; for awhile, but damn!  It&#39;s hard<br/>\nfor me to not put my two cents in.  And I&#39;ll admit that it&#39;s gotten me in<br/>\ntrouble in the past.

Yes, I am new to homeschooling, even newer to<br/>\nunschooling, but I&#39;m not new to parenting.  My two grown daughters, who<br/>\nwere schooled in public schools, were classic underachievers, yet I feel<br/>\nI did the &quot;very best&quot; I could for them given what I knew and had to work<br/>\nwith at the time.  While they are still struggling with career choices,<br/>\nall in all, they are well-adjusted, confident young women who are also<br/>\nparents.  They are also single parents.  If I say that they are doing the<br/>\n&quot;very best they can,&quot; I mean that, given the enormity of their<br/>\nresponsibilities, it can&#39;t be &quot;better&quot; at the moment even though &quot;better&quot;<br/>\nis the ideal for my grandkids and for all kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I mention not worrying about every move we make, I am talking about<br/>\nextreme positions and I&#39;m speaking literally, such as it&#39;s impossible to<br/>\nmonitor everything that comes out of our mouths, and how can we expect<br/>\n&quot;perfection&quot; in an imperfect world?  When I initially responded to<br/>\nsomeone&#39;s mentioning the book about punishing kids through rewards, I<br/>\nnever said I agreed that we in fact do punish our kids everytime we<br/>\nreward them.  I&#39;ve said, &quot;I&#39;m proud of you&quot; to my kids countless times. <br/>\nIt&#39;s just that every so often I tell them they can be proud of<br/>\nthemselves.  What&#39;s the problem here?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m guilty of having old-fashioned notions about parenting, but I<br/>\nthink that the number one priority should be to show our kids love and to<br/>\nmodel loving relationships with our partners, families, etc.  Is this all<br/>\nI think we have to do and let the pieces fall where they may?  Absolutely<br/>\nnot.  I think we have to have a plan, think before we speak when<br/>\npossible, model the behaviors we want to instill in our kids.  My point<br/>\nin all of this is only to say that we will make mistakes, but even that<br/>\nteaches our children, in my opinion, lessons about fallibility and human<br/>\nvulnerabilites and says, &quot;Hey, it&#39;s okay to screw up sometimes!&quot;  What is<br/>\nit we model for our kids when we react to others&#39; points of view -- not<br/>\nwith tolerance -- but with such blatant hostility??<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

I have <br/>\n&gt; been <br/>\n&gt;  reading -Punished by Rewards- and now that I think of it, that <br/>\n&gt; makes <br/>\n&gt;  sense.  So how do I undo it???????????<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t catch the beginning of this discussion, but I think I&#39;m<br/>\nunderstanding what it&#39;s about.  I plan on picking up the book, but I just<br/>\nwant to say that I have two grown daughters whom I lavished praise on<br/>\nwhen they were kids, but I was careful to not go to extremes since I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to raise megalomaniacs.  I think it&#39;s tough to go to<br/>\nextremes, however, without some &quot;caution&quot; flag popping up in our heads.<br/>\nBy that I mean that, to me, extreme would be something like, &quot;You&#39;re<br/>\nbetter than everyone else...prettier...smarter...&quot;, etc.; fill in the<br/>\nsuperlative.  And I think praise should be treated like candy -- dole out<br/>\nbits at a time and it&#39;s not so bad for you.  As with everything else in<br/>\nlife, I suppose, moderation seems to be the key.  I do believe that a<br/>\nstrong sense of self, of pride in one&#39;s accomplishments, should be<br/>\nintrinsically motivated.  I think it&#39;s OK to say to a child, &quot;You can be<br/>\nproud of yourself.&quot;  Even if we slip &lt;OMG!&gt; and say, &quot;I&#39;m proud of you,&quot;<br/>\nin the long-run it&#39;s less harmful than, oh, let&#39;s say, &quot;You can&#39;t do<br/>\nanything right!&quot; or, &quot;I wish you were never born.!&quot;  Children are<br/>\nresilient; they overcome the most dreadful things.  The majority are<br/>\nsmart enough when they reach adulthood to realize that, no matter how<br/>\n&quot;good&quot; they are, the world is not at their beckoned call.  They sort it<br/>\nall out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI listened to some advice I picked up somewhere when the kids were small<br/>\nwhich resulted in my saying things such as, &quot;I think I&#39;ll put that<br/>\npicture on the fridge&quot;, rather than, &quot;What a great picture you drew.&quot; <br/>\nIt&#39;s not that there&#39;s really anything wrong with the latter statement;<br/>\nit&#39;s just that, with the first, the child can deduce for him/herself<br/>\nthat, &quot;Hey, she likes what I drew.&quot;  This way, the child is &quot;rewarded&quot;<br/>\nintrinsically although the praise was generated extrinsically.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line:  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any danger from this group to our<br/>\nchildren&#39;s well-being.  We love them; they forgive us...<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
