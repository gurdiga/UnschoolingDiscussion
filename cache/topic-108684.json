Take the focus off food and work to make changes in<br/>\nyour lives that include more physical exercise.  Set a good example for the<br/>\nkids and have your own exercise routine.  There are so many fun things to<br/>\nchoose from that something should strike your fancy.  (I love Leslie Sansone<br/>\nlow impact aerobic tapes.  I can do them mindlessly 6 days a week and<br/>\nalthough they aren&#39;t very strenuous, they make a huge impact in how I feel.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been heavier and more inactive than was healthy at different times in<br/>\nmy life.  I love to eat for the taste of food alone, not to mention the<br/>\ncomfort it gives me and the fact that I can&#39;t stand being hungry. I have<br/>\nfound that with even a moderate level of moving each day I can eat a quite a<br/>\nlot of food and not gain weight.  Aerobic exercise ups your metabolism. It<br/>\nalso took away the constant pain I had in my lower back.  I am not rail<br/>\nthin.  I wear a size 12/14 but I feel healthy and strong.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep searching until you find something you like to do.  (and your dd too,<br/>\nbut setting a good example is probably more important for a lifetime.) Maybe<br/>\nget a gps and go on hikes to find geocaches if you need a reason to get<br/>\nmoving.  If life is interesting enough, she probably won&#39;t eat to fill a<br/>\nvoid, she&#39;ll eat when she needs it.  Keep life interesting and keep moving.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.344 / Virus Database: 267.11.9/116 - Release Date: 9/30/2005</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185316150,"authorName":"nrskay","from":"&quot;nrskay&quot; &lt;okmardesich@...&gt;","profile":"nrskay","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"food issues, unschooling","postDate":"1128221021","msgId":108684,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRobmhndCtoaGQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":108691,"prevInTime":108683,"nextInTime":108685,"topicId":108684,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have grown up always overweight and continue to struggle with my weight to this day.

My mom & dad were normal weight.  I&#39;m adopted <br/>\nand happen to know my birth mother.  She was overweight all of her <br/>\nlife too, as are one of my sisters and 2 brothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was little my adopted mom would take me to the doctor and he <br/>\nwould put me on a diet....  I was just a kid and I learned at a very <br/>\nyoung age the something was wrong with me.  I ate too much <br/>\n(according to the doctor).  That was the beginning of my troubles.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow at 51 yo I&#39;m beginning to understand my issues with food and my <br/>\nweight.  Limiting food is not the answer, because it puts the <br/>\nemphasis on the food and her weight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith my 11 yo dtr, I&#39;m very careful about not saying anything about <br/>\nher weight or eating.  She goes through growth spurts and eats like <br/>\na horse and then just eats a little until the next cycle of growth.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is not over weight and does not seem to have any issues with her <br/>\nweight like I did.  But, I let her eat what she wants, when she <br/>\nwants and however much she feels she needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have friends who don&#39;t let their kids eat candy at home and I have <br/>\nwitnessed those same children consuming large amounts of candy and <br/>\njunk when their parents aren&#39;t around.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m trying to say is take the issue off of her food, <br/>\nher weight, help her to become a little more active and let her work <br/>\nit our herself.
