Eight years in the military on <br/>\nmobility assignments and then a civilian job overseas saw to that.  His <br/>\nhealth is strong and it doesn&#39;t seem to have hurt him any.

Freedom is messy.  With it comes responsibility.  That includes the <br/>\nimpact my choices have on the people around me and vice versa.

I won&#39;t vaccinate for social reasons, i.e., &#39;let&#39;s <br/>\nvaccinate for diseases they&#39;ll be exposed to as a teenager, because all teens <br/>\nhave sex and we want to be sure and get everyone, so we&#39;ll start when they <br/>\nare babies&#39;.  Nope, not in our family.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that, we look at the likelihood of actually being exposed to a <br/>\nparticular disease, the risks to the child from the vaccine vs risks from <br/>\ndisease and go from there.  For example ds is 12.  As an infant he was <br/>\nvaccinated for MMR (before I even thought to argue about it).  The risk of <br/>\nbad results from catching any of these diseases increases pretty <br/>\nsignificantly for older children/adults, so we will continue that series.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always keep vaccinations up to date for tetanus.  It is a disease that is <br/>\naround today, with real potential to exposure.  Also, the disease itself has <br/>\na high incidence of death or paralysis.  Compared to the risks of the <br/>\nimmunization, it makes sense to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo continue polio vaccines makes no sense to me.  I realize polio vaccine was <br/>\nquite a breakthrough and the original development of this vaccine spared lots <br/>\nof people their lives or life long disability.  In fact, my SIL had polio and <br/>\nstill has some residual effects of the disease.  However, polio is not a <br/>\ndisease we are likely to be exposed to, so the vaccine risk is too high.  <br/>\nWere there a major epidemic, I would look again at this decision.  <br/>\n(unfortunately, ds has already received this one, too...way back when...)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest reason I don&#39;t vaccinate is a personal belief that all these <br/>\nvaccinations are harming the individual and society.  I believe the process <br/>\nof vaccinations actually disable the immune system, leaving the body more <br/>\ndisease prone either from contagious illness or injury from the vaccine.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s a gut level reaction.  I&#39;ve seen some studies and articles on the <br/>\nsubject which explained it much better than that but for me it came down to a <br/>\ngut reaction.  When I have researched the subject or read articles pro or <br/>\ncon, I come away consistently feeling it is not right for me or my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn interesting side note is that I&#39;m having major health problems.  It <br/>\nappears that I have an auto-immune dysfunction which is hereditary and <br/>\nmetabolic.  The metabolic part effects how my body processes everything, <br/>\nincluding vaccines or medications.  My children appear to have inherited this <br/>\ndisease from me.  I am convinced we would be in even worse shape if we had <br/>\nall the recommended vaccinations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy church does not have a stand against vaccinations, but, because it is a <br/>\n&#39;gut&#39; reaction for me, I have never hesitated to declare exemption due to <br/>\nreligious reasons.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, <br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"njfM_oXoNEKR6GdE3wHldBQ4hgLd922-asaOc52TxGPvisfBiL7gZjmnVJ2akHEBLSwH7CSkGC8REVk0gzVS_AG0lA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Vaccination","postDate":"969600776","msgId":13271,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwOTIyMDU1My5lOE01clBMMjYzNDRAc20wMTAxLnByb21lZGlhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":13270,"nextInTopic":13273,"prevInTime":13270,"nextInTime":13272,"topicId":13264,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I can tell you about Hep A & B which I wouldn t touch with a ten foot pole.
