But you didn&#39;t really, I just wanted to say <br/>\nwhat I had to say in the right way, and I was to sleepy!  <br/>\nI understand what you mean now, when I first read the post I thought it was <br/>\njust that everyone wanted to talk to her about hsing and she didn&#39;t always <br/>\nwant to talk about it.  Like she was the center of attention and didn&#39;t like <br/>\nit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo one likes to defend themselves all the time, I just simply don&#39;t.  One <br/>\ntime and one time only someone tried to start some stuff with my girlfriend <br/>\nand I at the music school.  Her son is very disruptive and has been all but <br/>\nkicked out of school.  Anyway, she started talking to us and my girlfriend <br/>\nalways feels she has to be defensive.  Then the woman started on me and said <br/>\nsomething about socialization.  I looked at my friend and we both just burst <br/>\nout laughing.  Then I told her we had no problem and turned around and walk <br/>\noff.  My friend spent another ten minutes before she could tear herself away. <br/>\n I don&#39;t mess with em.  If they start, just say, If you are really interested <br/>\nand want to know, I will be glad to share, if you want to debate, find <br/>\nsomeone else, I am here for pleasure.  If they persist, walk away and THEN <br/>\nyou know you need new acquaintances.  That&#39;s the way I look at it anyway!<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa,     ; &gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":426,"nextTopicId":541}}
