The original poster made a clear <br/>\ncontradiction in her post.  I posted the exact lines she said.  Kelly offered an <br/>\nexplanation.  But, for all practical purposes, what the original post said WAS a <br/>\ncontradiction.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNO safety rules means the kid can use any knife to cut anything they want.  <br/>\nMaybe the poster meant &quot;with adult supervision&quot;    But, that is still a &quot;rule&quot; <br/>\n, or a restriction.  &quot;you can use any knife you want ONLY when an adult can <br/>\nhelp you&quot;   Is that not what most folks on this list would do?   I think when <br/>\nsomeone says &quot;We have NO safety rules&quot;, it sounds like there is no regard for <br/>\nthe childs safety.   I do not think that is the case at all. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Lots of words, phrases, perceptions, DO get examined at the molecular level <br/>\non this list.   The truth is, unless one IS a totally non coercive parent, <br/>\nthey usually have &#39;safety rules&quot;   Do not go in the street, wear a helmet, wear <br/>\na seatbelt, don&#39;t eat poison, don&#39;t take candy from strangers.    What is so <br/>\nWRONG about saying &quot;we have safety rules&quot;??  Should they be called something <br/>\nother than rules?  Maybe, guidelines?  precautions?   <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom]  Safety rules..","postDate":"1053885793","msgId":70710,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZlLjJlNDMyNjMyLjJjMDI1ZjYxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70693,"nextInTopic":70730,"prevInTime":70709,"nextInTime":70711,"topicId":70679,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/25/03 10:40:00 AM, grlynbl@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-550473538\">In a message dated 5/25/03 10:40:00 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grlynbl@...\">grlynbl@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  But, with &quot;no safety rules&quot;, why wouldn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t a <br/>\nchild use an appropiate knife to cut a tomato if they wanted to? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause they&#39;re three and don&#39;t like tomatoes?<br/>\nBecause they don&#39;t care to learn all the differences between knives, maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all questions are worth taking to the molecular level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom]  Safety rules..","postDate":"1053883822","msgId":70730,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxOGUwMWMzMjMwNiQ4ZTcwMzRjMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGI4LjQwZGYyMTFhLjJjMDI0Nzk5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70710,"nextInTopic":70731,"prevInTime":70729,"nextInTime":70731,"topicId":70679,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... child.
