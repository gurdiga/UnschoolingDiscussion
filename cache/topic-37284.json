I can see how<br/>\nit would be difficult for some to believe that someone without violent<br/>\ntendences would want to watch violence.

There was a book, Night John, that children were supposed to read <br/>\nand report on for a grade (at the school where I worked) However, the book <br/>\ncontained graphic (of course we all have an imagination) content. The <br/>\nteachers didn&#39;t find that there was anything wrong with this and one teacher <br/>\nproceeded to tell me, &quot;at least they are not watching it on television!&quot; What <br/>\ndifference is that the child reads &quot;bad&quot; content on pages as opposed to <br/>\nseeing it on television. Either way there is going to be a mental picture <br/>\nthat the child has conjured up or a visual from the child watching <br/>\ntelevision. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would have to say that I don&#39;t agree with all things, but like I said <br/>\nbefore...I am easy to get along with. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of things that deem to provide an educational experience for <br/>\nour children.

It is all okay, why? Because we are parents that have <br/>\ndifferent beliefs, yet we can all come together with a common goal, to <br/>\nhomeschool our children and offer them something different as opposed to the <br/>\nnorm. We have all decided to step out of the box and open new doors for our <br/>\nfamilies.
