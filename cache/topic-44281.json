You just have to <br/>\nmake them &quot;Think&quot; that you are.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want more information, I&#39;ll share some tips I learned from <br/>\nanother list here at Yahoo.  There are ways to make them think they <br/>\nare in control, when actually you&#39;re the one calling the shots.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLike today, I got another visit from &quot;Caseworker&quot; who at first tried <br/>\nto say they both had to go to public school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then hit her with our counties statitics for the report cards and <br/>\nother statistics she knew nothing about. By time she left she finally <br/>\nagreed that &quot;Homeschooling&quot; seemed best for Mirial (YiPee!!! one <br/>\nobstacle down, my main concern), and she wants to see what <br/>\nunschooling is all about before deciding on Mariah.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo she left with a totally changed attitude, not the kind I was <br/>\nhoping for completely, but getting there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I am working on a 100 page book I plan to print out tonight, <br/>\nand bind up professionally looking, for her to get educated herself <br/>\nabout the benefits of unschooling.  By time she finish&#39;s reading all <br/>\nthe info I&#39;m copying from the internet about the benefits of <br/>\nhomeschooling and unschooling, she&#39;ll be ready to homeschool her own <br/>\nchildren (If she has any).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe key is too have more knowledge than they do, and keep yourself <br/>\nahead of the game, so that when they leave they will be going &quot;Huh&quot; <br/>\nwhat the hey was she talking about&quot; and also wondering just what laws <br/>\nthey may be treading on if they decide to try and push the issue.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll accomplish 1 of 2 things.  You&#39;ll either get an overworked <br/>\nperson too tired to research the subject temselves, and will basicaly <br/>\ngive up after you keep pushing more and more &quot;Knowledge&quot; that they <br/>\nhave to research on them. Or you&#39;ll get a caseworker that is <br/>\ngenuinely concerned about what&#39;s in the best interest of the <br/>\nchildren, who will take the time to research, and if you&#39;re fighting <br/>\nsomething you know is best, she&#39;ll admit you were right all along <br/>\n<br/>\nMy caseworker today didn&#39;t even know my county is ranked as one of <br/>\nthe worst in the country.   Knowledge is power, and the more <br/>\nknowledge you get, the better off you&#39;ll be.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh I could share so much more, but it would take to long.  I even <br/>\nconfused a judge once, about a case law I brought up in court once <br/>\nconcerning my children, that he didn&#39;t even know existed (I won my <br/>\ncase).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you ever want to talk, just hollar :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaria<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I want him out of school but I don&#39;t want them to take him so I am<br/>\n&gt; reluctantly following their rules. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10294444,"authorName":"Myranda","from":"&quot;Myranda&quot; &lt;myrandab@...&gt;","profile":"randascloudream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] SC, laws and DSS","postDate":"1032285527","msgId":44283,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzZWUwMWMyNWU3MyRlMDQyODEyMCQwMTNmZmVhOUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwMzIwOTczNDkuMTk1MS4xNjA3Ny5tMTRAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDA3ODAxYzI1ZTcyJGQxZTAwZjQwJDIxMWMzYjQ0QGdvb3NjazAxLnNjLmNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":44281,"nextInTopic":44298,"prevInTime":44282,"nextInTime":44284,"topicId":44281,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Virginia, Even though the authorities say you have to be approved first, YOU DON T!!!!
