LOL  It was such a foreign idea to me that when he asked I wasn&#39;t sure<br/>\nwhat to do.  The Playland is completely visible from the check stands and we<br/>\nwander past every few minutes to check on him.  Plus, he&#39;s 5 and VERY good<br/>\nat telling adults what he thinks.  He&#39;s always dissapointed to leave so it<br/>\nmust be a good experience<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny, Lanora and I have to find enough stuff to look at for an hour so<br/>\nhe can be in there.

I <br/>\njust couldn&#39;t think of a better solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh will probably need to be hospitalized again some day, and I&#39;m <br/>\nworking on finding a better solution for then, but haven&#39;t yet.
