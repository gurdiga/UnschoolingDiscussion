My son who is almost five sounds a lot like your <br/>\ndaughter.  He hates structure and anybody telling him how to do anything.  <br/>\nAnd forget group activities.  Once when we were discussing what school was <br/>\nlike, I told him that he would have to ask the teacher to go to the <br/>\nbathroom.  He looked at me incredulously and snorted, &quot;If I have to do that <br/>\nthen I will just turn up the music really loud, walk out the door and go <br/>\nhome.&quot;  I&#39;m still not sure exactly what the music is about, but I assume it <br/>\nis symbolic of blocking out this authoritative figure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, often times I feel like I am not doing enough with my kids - <br/>\nespecially when I hear about all these &quot;great&quot; things other kids are doing <br/>\nin preschools.  But then I think about how much cooler it is that my kids <br/>\nget to relax all day and follow their own rhythms.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree...I think you shouldn&#39;t do any classes with your daughter.  <br/>\nActually, I remember now when I was in some group - I think it was the <br/>\nBrownies or Blue Birds or something like that.  There was this art activity <br/>\nwith eggs that all the girls were doing.  For some reason I was unable to <br/>\nfollow the instructor&#39;s directions and so the instructor told another adult <br/>\nto go over and help me.  I remember feeling extremely humiliated as none of <br/>\nthe other girls were having difficulty.  I felt scared around the other <br/>\ngirls that I didn&#39;t know.  Looking back, I now realize that it never really <br/>\ndawned on me back then that I didn&#39;t HAVE to be there...I just assumed I had <br/>\nto be because my mom put me in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nErika  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nFree up your inbox with MSN Hotmail Extra Storage.

She is free to leave the class and come to me downstairs<br/>\nwhenever she wants, and will usually take a break towards the end of the<br/>\nhour. We don&#39;t even get to Monday park day on a fully regular basis. Jayn<br/>\nreally does fill her time with playing and art and physical stuff. I am an<br/>\nenormous believer, especially in artistic and creative endeavors, in<br/>\nsupplying materials (or other kids) and then backing off.

Permission to embellish your character may come with<br/>\nan improv group, but not always with a group that puts on a play.

I try very hard to make the vast majority of Jayn&#39;s<br/>\ninteractions with other homeschoolers, in activities that reflect a culture<br/>\nof freedom and individual explorations.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
