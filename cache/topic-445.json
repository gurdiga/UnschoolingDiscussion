However, I find it difficult to manage all my<br/>\nstress relief, shoulder crying and comiserating, as well as all my<br/>\ncomraderie and sharing of mutual excitement and ideas, over the internet.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know anyone in person who is &#39;like minded.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I like to get together for tea with girlfriends while my kids are sleeping<br/>\n(not happening) or go out to lunch together at a little cafe (not<br/>\nhappening) or have couples and single friends over for dinner and<br/>\nconversation (not happening.)  I am also a very physically affectionate<br/>\nperson and I enjoy being tactile with people.  I like to hug my friends and<br/>\nbe close to them when we are talking and sharing.  But I don&#39;t have any<br/>\ngood friends here like that.  We moved too recently and I am too shy and<br/>\ncautious with strangers in person.  The ladies in the Playgroup seem to be<br/>\nmaintaining their emotional comfort distance, and my husband is always<br/>\nnagging me to make some better friends, as he knows I need them.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWith more than 18 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n....ONElist is THE place where the world talks!<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nCheck it out!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
