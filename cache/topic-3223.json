We&#39;ve been passing germs around here for a month....even<br/>\nduring our 10 day vacation,  the toddler was sick 5 days and up six nights.<br/>\nSo my sleep debt only increased on *vacation*!<br/>\n    Thought we were past that since,  but for the last few nights the<br/>\ntoddler (17 mos.) has awakened in the night.  (two nights ago it was from 1<br/>\na.m. to 4:30 a.m. !<br/>\n    I used to think I wanted four children in our family,  but this sleep<br/>\ndeprivation with a !7mos old is changing my mind! (No to mention how it<br/>\nwould change our economics (i.e.,  we don&#39;t have a van,  only a 5 seat -<br/>\nsubcompact! - car,  don&#39;t know where another bed could go in this 1250 sq<br/>\nft, tiny bedroomed house).<br/>\n    I&#39;m rambling in delerium...I apologize...Anyway,  this makes it tough to<br/>\nfollow through with the 7.5 yo on projects.  Oh well,  I&#39;m hanging in<br/>\nthere.....knowing *This To Shall Pass*.
