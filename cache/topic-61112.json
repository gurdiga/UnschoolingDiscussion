Hi Wendy and welcome. I just love the way you started this email. :o) I wish that all parents would first see their kids as wonderful and amazing.

My name is Wendy and I am the mother of an amazing and<br/>\n&gt;incredible 11 year old boy.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Wendy and welcome. I just love the way you started this email. :o) I wish <br/>\nthat all parents would first see their kids as wonderful and amazing. <br/>\nEverything else is just details.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;ve gotten somewhat better over the past few years, but recently <br/>\n&gt;&gt;(literally days ago) my son approached me with the idea of unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He DOES sound amazing. Sounds like he&#39;s done his research and has the <br/>\nconfidence to forge a different path.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;and eventually latched on to my own interests and am now an avid reader, <br/>\n&gt;&gt;writer, learner, liver, etc.  Why can&#39;t I trust my son to do the same?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve been conditioned by the &quot;experts&quot; not to trust your son. It&#39;s a <br/>\npretty all encompassing societal message. There&#39;s no shame. You&#39;re open to <br/>\nthis new idea. That&#39;s a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m afraid he&#39;ll never be motivated to pick up a book or look up something <br/>\n&gt;&gt;that he&#39;s interested in.  I worry that college will be out of his reach.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why not just take some time off altogether to deschool and get used to this <br/>\nnew way of living. Get yourself used to observing the learning that is going <br/>\non. It won&#39;t look like school-research papers, book reports, etc-but it will <br/>\nbe learning for the sake of getting information he needs. Parent him NOW as <br/>\nan 11 year old incredible, amazing boy. College is well within his reach, <br/>\nbut you don&#39;t need to stress over it NOW. That&#39;s for the schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green <br/>\nearth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly alive.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                      ~ Thich Nhat Hanh<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61098,"nextTopicId":60857}}
