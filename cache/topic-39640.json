Simple.**<br/>\n<br/>\nBullshit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose 44 sounds are represented by (I don&#39;t have the time to look it up right <br/>\nnow) way more than 44 letters or letter groups. PLUS many of those letter <br/>\ngroups represent more than one sound. Several of the vowel groups represent <br/>\nnumerous sounds, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES PHONICS HORRIBLY HORRIBLY DIFFICULT FOR <br/>\nKIDS WHO ARE NOT MEMORIZING WHOLE WORDS BUT TRYING TO SOUND THEM OUT EACH AND <br/>\nEVERY TIME THEY SEE THEM.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery damn time someone posts about how easy phonics is to teach they do the <br/>\nlittle routine with short vowel sounds and single consanants in a CVC <br/>\npattern. Yup, that&#39;s easy. It&#39;s also NOT more than 50% of what kids are <br/>\ntrying to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately I don&#39;t have time to get into a longer discussion on this <br/>\nissue, as I&#39;m leaving for NY in the morning and I&#39;ll be gone for 2 weeks. <br/>\nI&#39;ll probably run past it when I come back, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed, did you write this article yourself?<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39620,"nextTopicId":39643}}
