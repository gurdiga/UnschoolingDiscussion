The <br/>\nman is the head of the household, just as Christ is the head of the <br/>\nChurch.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember that I was a non-person as far as my father was concerned, <br/>\nuntil I turned 17.  Then, all of a sudden, from one day to the next, <br/>\nmy opinion mattered to him.  He would listen to me with respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a load of bull.  I respected my children from day one.  I <br/>\nunderstood and worked with the limitations that came with their youth <br/>\nand inexperience, and never forgot that I was the responsible party, <br/>\nbut what they thought and needed and how they felt was always <br/>\nimportant to me as we moved through each day.

And parents will <br/>\nwant to go through the line and help the littler kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have another experience with such things.   I&#39;ve been to feasts in <br/>\nthree pueblos near where I grew up:  San Juan, Santa Clara and San Ildefonso.   <br/>\nFeasts are in homes, like on the same day lots of homes will be serving a <br/>\ntraditional meal.  Kind of like Thanksgiving (different food) in the format and <br/>\ntradition, but they have more than one feast day a year, and they differ somewhat <br/>\n(different pueblos have different particular days).<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of putting up bunches of tables, they serve at the regular table, six <br/>\nor eight people at a time usually.  And it&#39;s a precedence order depending <br/>\nsomewhat on the event and on the rank of the people.  I was often a teenager, and <br/>\nso was usually at the last or second to the last table, with whichever friend <br/>\nI went with.  Once I went with Rosita Tsosie to a Pueblo where she didn&#39;t <br/>\nlive (she was from Santa Clara) and so I got to eat when she ate, because I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know other people at that house and so they seated me at her &quot;level&quot; of <br/>\nprecedence.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not discussed much--the people serving just know who ranks next, they <br/>\nseat the people that person will want to talk to most, they try not to snub <br/>\nanyone, and the meal flows along pretty quickly (UNlike Thanksgiving).  I guess <br/>\none batch of people will be at the table 20 or 25 minutes, and then they clear <br/>\nit and switch out casually.   People are informed when they&#39;re going to be  <br/>\nnext, so they stay near the house (see how often I was a kid and outside with <br/>\nother kids? &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not offensive or insulting in that context.  I was just always glad to <br/>\nhave been invited at all!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last time I went will probably be the last time I ever go, and it was my <br/>\nfriend Jon&#39;s funeral.  I was about middlin&#39; of six tables, I think.  I saw <br/>\nwith his ex wife, who was my age and I&#39;d known them both since before they were <br/>\nmarried, and with one of Jon&#39;s sisters, a few years older than I am.   There <br/>\nwere younger people still waiting, but they didn&#39;t mind.  They were playing <br/>\nvideo games in the house next door (same lot, relatives) and kicking around in the <br/>\nyard talking.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIn an SCA context there are times when my kids aren&#39;t seated the first round, <br/>\nif there are people who outrank them and the table&#39;s full.  But that doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean they can&#39;t get to food, just means they don&#39;t get the sit-down candlelit <br/>\nfirst-class section.
