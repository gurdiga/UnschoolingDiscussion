Your whole framework is different-.<br/>\n<br/>\n   the old framework is full of ideas we have because we are such good students of our culture, we know it so well, it is not even a &quot;knowing&quot; anymore, more like our bones have it written on them. we dont question our premises.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So I think, when I read your question, I am not &quot;doing unschooling&quot; because of a result I am going for (i.e. magical reading).  It is not a &quot;method&quot; that I chose to &quot;educate&quot; my kids.  Because the focus is not my kids- it is me- it is me getting rid of my idea that I have the right, authority, responsibility, to force my ideas and adgendas onto another person&#39;s life.  I dont &quot;educate&quot; anyone (faulty premise)- people &quot;educate&quot; themselves. People can&#39;t eat for one another, and they can&#39;t learn for one another either.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  It is me getting rid of my idea that I have to &quot;worry&quot; about something that doesnt bother my child, that I have to give them help, ideas or things they didnt ask for. <br/>\n<br/>\n  And it is also realizing that when they do really need help, they *will* make it evident.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  It is unlearning the idea that kids are not capable of leading their own life, being their own person- it is learning that kids REALLY ARE REAL PEOPLE- just like me.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  It is learning that when we give up the idea that we have to live our life AND our children&#39;s life, we experience true freedom ourselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Our codependant, dysfunctional society has few examples of real trust- so we cant really fit it in our brains.  BUT when we experience it first hand (not just read it in an e-mail :-), but really feel it, and our kids feel our trust, THEN lord have mercy!  we are looking at the world from heaven!  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway,  Im thinking a paradigm shift is in order :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Love to you,<br/>\n  Bronwen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3979435,"authorName":"Annette Naake","from":"&quot;Annette Naake&quot; &lt;naake1999@...&gt;","profile":"naake1999","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"the magic of reading (maybe)","postDate":"1012280648","msgId":31765,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PExBVzItRjYyTkdDWFdHbVF5dDUwMDAxMDJjMUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31766,"prevInTime":31764,"nextInTime":31766,"topicId":31765,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Someone wrote (and not all that recently; I m on digest): With the written word facing him at every turn, trying to let go of your expectations would be the ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1596976274\">Someone wrote (and not all that recently; I&#39;m on digest):<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the written word<br/>\nfacing him at every turn, trying to let go of your expectations would be the<br/>\nbest thing for him.

But do offer to read to him, no matter how old he is, and do allow him <br/>\nto see that YOU enjoy reading. If you do, of course. I have noticed that if <br/>\nkids have a good vocabulary, they catch on to reading faster. So anything <br/>\nthat  builds vocabulary is going to help in the long run: plays, songs, <br/>\njokes, poems... heck, talking.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this brings me to another point. There are people on this list who <br/>\napparently know 16yos who can&#39;t or don&#39;t read. I think that would really <br/>\nbother me. To those of you who are sure that if we just surround our kids <br/>\nwith books, etc., and then sit back and watch the magic happen: What if it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t? Is it acceptable to become an adult in our society who just doesn&#39;t <br/>\nread? Would you want to allow your kid to go out into the world so <br/>\nunprepared? Aren&#39;t you worried they&#39;ll be taken advantage of, or be unable <br/>\nto negotiate contracts/instructions/newspapers?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31814,"nextTopicId":31805}}
