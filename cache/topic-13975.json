It is almost universally celebrated, by those of virtually all<br/>\nreligions, or no religion at all. Preparations for it take place for a period<br/>\nof weeks or even months, and it is eagerly awaited by young and old alike. More<br/>\nis published and broadcast as part of its annual commemoration than for any<br/>\nother holiday of the year.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is neither a domesticated mentally challenged fowl nor a funny-hatted man<br/>\nwith silver buckles on his shoes associated with it.  It is not Thanksgiving.<br/>\nIn fact, it is a holiday without a popular name.  I write of course of the day<br/>\nafter Thanksgiving, a day which is the source of many of the hopes - to be<br/>\nrealized and dashed - of America&#39;s children in the coming month, and acts as<br/>\neither a joyous sign or ominous harbinger for the health of the American<br/>\neconomy, and the fate of tens if not hundreds of thousand of workers, business<br/>\nowners, and their families around the globe.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the evening of Thanksgiving Day, after the turkey has hit the soup, I gather<br/>\nup the hundreds of pages of ads for the &quot;After Thanksgiving Day Sale&quot;. Now in<br/>\nour family, as Quakers, we don&#39;t celebrate a traditional gift-giving Christmas,<br/>\nso some of the heat is off. But the sales are good, I&#39;m told (though I&#39;ve often<br/>\nsuspected that the stores just mark up all the prices on their winter goods and<br/>\nthen take 40% off so that the prices are pretty much the same; I don&#39;t worship<br/>\nin the mall often enough to know for sure.)  I then decide what I &#39;need&#39; or<br/>\n&#39;want&#39; (when I say &quot;I&quot;, it is a corporate &quot;I&quot;, like in homeschooling family).<br/>\nThere&#39;s usually one or at most two items to be found in each of six or seven<br/>\ndifferent stores, the stores of course being scattered in various and sundry<br/>\nparts of the city.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughters and I arise at 6 a.m., I having pressed upon them how crucial it<br/>\nis to arrive early, and having convinced them of the compelling superiority of<br/>\neach particular item in the store that is our destination. We pull up at the<br/>\nfirst store a little before 7. Stand in line. Purchase item. Then on to the<br/>\nnext store, and the next. We are relentlessly efficient. Like feeding sharks.<br/>\nSometimes we have to choose among colors, or designs, or whatnot. But no<br/>\ntomfoolery - we know how to do this. We stick to the list. We don&#39;t browse. We<br/>\ndon&#39;t look at socks in the store where we buy jackets, or ties where we get<br/>\nbedspreads. We don&#39;t get distracted by trinkets, sale signs, Santa Claus, or<br/>\nhandbills. We avoid &quot;smellville&quot; (that&#39;s what we call the cosmetics section of<br/>\nthe department store.) We refuse to be distracted. By 11 a.m., we are home,<br/>\nlike big game hunters, having bagged our limit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy 11:30, after surveying our cache over a second cup of coffee, nausea sets<br/>\nin. I have convinced myself, and started to convince most of the rest of the<br/>\nfamily (my wife, having conscientious abstained, doesn&#39;t need much convincing),<br/>\nthat at least half the items we purchased we really don&#39;t need, or they aren&#39;t<br/>\nparticularly nice, or they aren&#39;t any better than the same item we saw for ten<br/>\npercent of the price we paid in the local thrift shop, and I don&#39;t like<br/>\nsleeping under a blanket made by exploited children in Bangladesh or watching<br/>\nmy younger daughter run around in athletic shoes fabricated in unventilated<br/>\nsweatshops in Indonesia (has anyone found a good alternative for these?)<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the next three days, I&#39;ll bring back at least half the items (the children<br/>\nare excused) - perhaps these days should be dubbed &quot;Albert&#39;s Weekend of<br/>\nReturns&quot;. The sales clerks hate to see me - they haven&#39;t been trained for<br/>\nreturns yet! Maybe I&#39;ll end up sending the extra money to India (or wherever<br/>\nelse I think it&#39;s needed), or, in rare instances, I&#39;ll exchange what we have<br/>\nbought for different stuff. But I&#39;ll have burned up ten gallons of gas,<br/>\ngenerated fair quantities of stress and used up good chunks of time we could<br/>\nhave spent in more life-fulfilling activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no question that I (like many Americans) am suffering from a very<br/>\nparticular neurotic &#39;thought disorder&#39;, and I am now in recovery. Teaching our<br/>\nchildren to become knowledgeable consumers is important, of course. But getting<br/>\nthem to understand the inherent dishonesty behind the artificial production of<br/>\nnew needs and desires is even more vital.  Liberating my children by providing<br/>\nalternatives to America&#39;s religion of consumption, and helping them understand<br/>\nthe non-material basis for a truly satisfying life is, in my judgment, central<br/>\nto my family&#39;s homeschooling efforts, and ranks up there well ahead of state<br/>\ncapitals, square roots, or French verbs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I&#39;ve gotten some help. The holiday has been given an appropriate name<br/>\nthat has been gaining in popularity - &quot;International Buy Nothing Day&quot;! Check it<br/>\nout at www.adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/  Started about five years ago by a<br/>\nCanadian magazine named Adbusters (I guess my lack of economic patriotism is<br/>\nshowing), BND, as it is now affectionately known, was celebrated last year in<br/>\nmore than 30 countries, including France, Japan, Panama, Israel, South Korea,<br/>\nBrazil, as well as the United States.  Billed as a &quot;global carnival of life in<br/>\nthe face of consumer conformity&quot;, BND has gone so far as to produce radio and<br/>\ntelevision spots to get their message across, though in most cases requests to<br/>\npurchase time for the spots have been rejected by network executives [&quot;Contrary<br/>\nto the function of advertising itself and against our ethics (sic),&quot; said one)]<br/>\nonly to have the story of their rejection, complete with ad clips, make it on<br/>\nthe evening news.  On the BND website, you can download &quot;Christmas Gift<br/>\nExemption Vouchers&quot; to give to friends and family, templates for buttons and<br/>\ntee shirts, and a full range of posters and press releases. A celebration is<br/>\nlikely coming to a town or city near you-and, if it hasn&#39;t yet, start one! Make<br/>\na new family tradition.  Adbusters, by the way, is a delightfully irreverent,<br/>\nsophisticated rag filled with strategies for bringing corporations back under<br/>\npeople&#39;s control, and fighting the commercialization of public education (don&#39;t<br/>\nget me started on that one!), and is a great source for posters, stickers, and<br/>\nother materials to be used in guerilla anti-marketing campaigns. Your<br/>\nrebellious (or just socially conscious) homeschooled teen or pre-teen will love<br/>\nit!<br/>\n<br/>\nNot quite ready for Buy Nothing Day? Well, then connect up with the Center for<br/>\na New American Dream&#39;s &quot;Kids and Commercialism Campaign&quot;. You can find them<br/>\nonline at www.newdream.org/campaign/kids/index.html.  Download their excellent<br/>\nbrochure, &quot;Tips for Parenting in a Commercial Culture.&quot;  There is a kids<br/>\nwebsite full of fun, non-commercial play ideas, advice from responsible<br/>\nconsumption gurus, essay contests, and links to dozens of groups who will keep<br/>\nyou better informed as you gird up your loins, take up your battle axe, and<br/>\nstand ready to defend your hearth and kin against the next advertising<br/>\nonslaught.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmericans represent less than 5% of the world&#39;s population, but consume 30% of<br/>\nthe planet&#39;s material resources, and we continue to churn out waste at an<br/>\nalarming rate. One scientist has figured out that we would need four extra<br/>\nplanets if everyone on earth consumed as much as Americans do. But let&#39;s not<br/>\nload down our holidays with guilt. Rather, let&#39;s choose to use our holidays to<br/>\nreconnect ourselves with friends, with nature, and with our playful, creative<br/>\nsides, and help rebuild communities that extend far beyond the confines of the<br/>\nshopping mall parking lot. And, if we&#39;re really smart, we can do that with our<br/>\nchildren every day. For me, that&#39;s what homeschooling is all about.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake a big poster with your kids emblazoned &quot;More Fun, Less Stuff!&quot; Try it out<br/>\nas a family slogan (you could even write a family jingle!), and hang it in a<br/>\nprominent place. Next time you feel the urge to shop coming on, look at the<br/>\nposter, and you&#39;ll know it&#39;s time to clean out the garage. &quot;Hey, this could<br/>\nspell the end of civilization as we know it,&quot; says my friend Anthony (I think<br/>\nhe was referring to responsible consumerism, not to the new era of uncluttered<br/>\ngarages across America.)
