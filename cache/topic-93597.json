Real life has limitations that only <br/>\ngames can ignore, which is what makes it real life, more like a game the more <br/>\nwe <br/>\neliminate its limitations. And real life never includes everybody. Real life <br/>\nis the clubs we&#39;re in and clubs we&#39;re not. . .   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe definition of a game (a game as opposed to &quot;just playing&quot;) is that there <br/>\nare restrictions and limitations and the players see how well they can do <br/>\nwithin those artificial restrictions.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven &quot;let&#39;s play cops and robbers&quot; has implied rules, and kids will point out <br/>\nquickly when one cheats.   There aren&#39;t jetplanes in cops and robbers, for <br/>\ninstance.  There&#39;s probably not time travel, unless they state upfront they&#39;re <br/>\nplaying within the restraints and realities of a certain novel or movie or <br/>\nthey&#39;ve made something up.   But without other pre-set conditions, cops and <br/>\nrobbers involves someone snagging a treasure, &quot;the good guys&quot; chase them, find them, <br/>\nget it back, with some &quot;bang bang&quot; possibly involved, and maybe a jail from <br/>\nwhich they can escape which adds the element of tag and a base.  But kids don&#39;t <br/>\nneed to discuss the rules in advance, they just need to know who&#39;s who and <br/>\nthey go.  Simplest version is just nothing but chase in the first place, but you <br/>\ncan &quot;arrest&quot; people or shoot them.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying a game with cards is very limited as compared with what could be done <br/>\nwith cards in the real world.  You could clip them to a bike frame so they <br/>\nmake noise in the spokes or learn to throw them great distances with accuracy, <br/>\nor use them folded up to keep a table from rocking or you could eat them or <br/>\nstart fires with them or tape them together or put them all over a w Game, rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93512,"nextTopicId":93545}}
