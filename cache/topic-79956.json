Every five minutes (well maybe about 6 or 7 times in a couple of hours &lt;g&gt;) she&#39;d ask me how do you spell object.  I&#39;d spell it and she&#39;d type it out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my head I was having a little conversation with myself &quot;sheesh, I&#39;m getting sick of this - no you&#39;re not Lee-Ann, be happy that she feels comfortable asking you - yeah, but I can&#39;t even string two thoughts together for myself - come on, look at her, she&#39;s loving what she&#39;s doing don&#39;t spoil it&quot;.  I&#39;m pleased to report that Smeagol one out over Gollum that time LOL  I answered her cheerfully, every time.  The next day Megan was playing the Sims again.......&quot;mum how do you spell obj....no it&#39;s okay I can do that myself now.......mum how do you spell world?&quot;  lmao<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we did school at home I tried getting her to write the letter, make the sound, say the word (instructions in a phonics work book that we had), she hated it.  Well she sure can handle it nicely now and neither of us even realised she was doing that.  Listen to me spell, repeat the letters in her head and find them on the keyboard!  Same thing as the book but way more fun and something that she really really wanted to know.

I have always responded<br/>\nthat IF he doesn&#39;t know how to spell something or what a word means that I <br/>\ntell<br/>\nhim, I don&#39;t say *look it up yourself.* I say that the kids need to be<br/>\nafforded the same respect. He says the kids are different, that the need to <br/>\nLEARN<br/>\nhow to do these things themselves. I think that they will learn by observing <br/>\nme.**<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids all know how to use references. They know how to use dictionaries, <br/>\nencyclopedias, computer databases (the older two know how to use card catalogs, <br/>\na skill that&#39;s already obsolete!), indexes... and how to ask people for help <br/>\nand information, as well. When they wanted to know how to use things, I showed <br/>\nthem. I never ever answered a request for information with &quot;go look it up&quot; - I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t say it to a friend and I think it&#39;s rude to say it to a child asking <br/>\nfor help or information. It hasn&#39;t made my children dependent on me for <br/>\ninformation. Children WANT to be able to use the tools they see used by the adults <br/>\naround them. They want to be competent in their world, and will actively <br/>\nstrive toward that goal if we aren&#39;t constantly getting in their way and pushing at <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a paperback dictionary sitting on the loveseat across the room. <br/>\nSarah left it there - she&#39;s been writing a letter to a new friend in another state <br/>\nand she wants everything to be spelled correctly. She&#39;s asked me how to spell <br/>\na few things but mostly she seems to be looking a lot of things up in the <br/>\ndictionary. This is a new behaviour for her. I&#39;m not sure where the dictionary <br/>\ncame from, it&#39;s not familiar to me. Maybe it&#39;s the one my sister and I bought at <br/>\nWalmart last fall to settle disagreements over a word game we were playing <br/>\nwhile sitting with our dying father. If it is that one I hope she&#39;s finding it a <br/>\nmore useful tool than we did, we were both wishing we&#39;d brought our own.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I never told her to go use a dictionary, and yet, there she is. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79961,"nextTopicId":79943}}
