He was bringing the play into his &#39;real&#39; life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe show was banned for a short while. Now he can watch it and enjoy it<br/>\nwithout it &#39;taking over&#39; his daily life.  It wasn&#39;t a good thing to watch if<br/>\nhe couldn&#39;t determine what was real and what was not.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is SOOOOOO incredibly sad! I mean, so sad that I can hardly sit here and <br/>\nread this! Sad, sad, sad! To-my-core-deep-in-my-soul sad!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two boys, 16-next-week and eight-next month. Both were &quot;Batman&quot;. And I <br/>\ndon&#39;t mean wore a Batman costume occasionally. I mean BATMAN! <br/>\n<br/>\nDuncan has eight or nine bat-costumes that he wore daily. He lives (still) in <br/>\nthe Batcave---ask anyone who has been to my house: the room is painted dark <br/>\nblue with a glow-in-the-dark batsignal on one wall, the town of Gotham with <br/>\nglow-in-the-dark windows on another, the Batmobile on a third, and &quot;POW!&quot;, <br/>\nSOCK!&quot;, &quot;OOF!&quot; on other walls. Batman curtains and blanket with dozens of the <br/>\nplastic Batmen and villians everywhere! (We also have some Spiderman stuff, but it&#39;s <br/>\nminor!)<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron, on the other hand, only had one or two costumes, but he WAS Batman. <br/>\nYou were ALWAYS to address him as Batman (or the Caped Crusader)! Unless, of <br/>\ncourse, he was in &quot;street clothes&quot; when you were to address him as &quot;Mister <br/>\nWayne&quot; or &quot;Bruce&quot;! Seriously!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve given both boys complete freedom with fantasy play. They both really <br/>\ngot into these characters. Duncan&#39;s lasted YEARS longer than Cameron&#39;s. Cameron <br/>\nwas also a dinosaur (T-Rex, of course) for about a year. He also went to <br/>\nschool! :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth boys brought smiles to strangers&#39; faces when seen in public with their <br/>\ncostumes on. More than one person was TOTALLY entranced with Cameron when he <br/>\nanswered that his name was Bruce Wayne! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be afraid that, if I were to have hindered this deep and intense <br/>\nfantasy play, they might have taken it &quot;underground&quot; and been little batmen when <br/>\nthey knew I wasn&#39;t watching or made up stories/scenes in their minds that they <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t share with me-----or WORSE! Given up on fantasy play all together! My <br/>\nheart breaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt IS real to them----just as your religion, which *I* think of fantasy, is <br/>\nreal to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nDragon Tales would no more turn him into a dragon as Batman would turn my <br/>\nboys into Batmen as Chritianity would turn me into Mother Teresa!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89350,"nextTopicId":89432}}
