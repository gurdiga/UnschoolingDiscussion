Some<br/>\nyears ours make it (and we&#39;re only about 12&quot; - 18&quot; we<br/>\ndidn&#39;t measure, I&#39;m guessing) At one time my husband<br/>\nwas really into this and we use to move the Koi into<br/>\nplastic horse troughs in the greenhouse for the<br/>\nwinter. Well, he had invested literally thousands of<br/>\ndollars in Koi - and we had a *sudden* early cold snap<br/>\nand lost them all!  Since then we stick to gold fish<br/>\nand shiners and the like (when my oldest dd were<br/>\nyounger they use to go cray fishing at the creek down<br/>\nthe road and release the cray fish in the pond. One<br/>\ntime we saw a neighbor boy going up the road with a<br/>\nstring of fish,one was a beautiful sunny and the gills<br/>\nwere still moving. We ask him if he&#39;d release it in<br/>\nthe pond, he did, and thanks to mild winters it lived<br/>\na few years!) Even at 3&#39; it would be best to have an<br/>\naerator though - but if you have an aerator it won&#39;t<br/>\nfreeze completely so the kids can&#39;t skate (our<br/>\noriginal purpose.) The funniest thing to me is when<br/>\nthe pond first gets a thin sheet of ice on it and the<br/>\nfish are still swimming (when it really freezes they<br/>\ngo into a sort of suspended animation) and the cat can<br/>\nsee them under the ice and chases them around batting<br/>\nat the surface of the ice!<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nMichele<br/>\n(mom of 5dd: Justice 22, Felicity 20, Christian 18, Grace 13, Elysian (Mia)2)<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email alerts & NEW webcam video instant messaging with Yahoo!
