The <br/>\nkids who are here all the time are very respectful and kind and I don&#39;t mind <br/>\nfeeding them at all.  It&#39;s the child who is usually a friend of a friend who <br/>\nis just remotely &quot;related&quot; to my kids or their activities that behave that way, <br/>\nprobably because they know they don&#39;t come regularly and so they don&#39;t care <br/>\nwhat if they are disrespectful or what others think.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI could be totally wrong and they do it for other reasons.  Most of the <br/>\n&quot;older&quot; kids this happens at nights after most of us are in bed and the nearly <br/>\ngrown ones are playing video games and watching movies, listening to music and <br/>\nsuch.  Someone will be here and someone else is looking for them so they show up <br/>\nto play or watch and they wander upstairs and help themselves, sometimes to <br/>\nEVERYTHING they can find.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not so bad now, my 18 year old has begun to speak out about others being <br/>\ndisrespectful in HIS home and will tell his good friends NOT to bring <br/>\n__________ back over again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight we had five extra kids for dinner, all very respectful and good <br/>\nfriends of my kids.  I didn&#39;t know they were going to be here when I planned <br/>\ndinner, but my son got a new car so they all had to come and oohh and ahhh over it.  <br/>\nIt was dinner time, so I had my oldest run by the store on the way over and <br/>\nget me more potatoes and steaks and they all had a great time with dinner on <br/>\nthe deck.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if I can just talk them into helping CLEAN, it will be a GREAT evening!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve loved hearing the suggestions that you all have for snacks and the <br/>\nlittle baggies and such.

I did at one <br/>\npoint have to hide snacks, sodas, etc., when my boys were teenagers.  There <br/>\nmight be fifteen or twenty teenagers here and maybe three or four were <br/>\ndisrespectful enough that if there were four or five cases of soda downstairs, they <br/>\nthought they HAD to drink it all because they COULD.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe final straw was a couple hundred dollars worth of food disappearing in a <br/>\nday... no one can afford that every day.  My kids starting seeing that if they <br/>\nhad disrespectful kids here (usually a friend of someone else who tagged <br/>\nalong with someone else that was here) and they drank up all the sodas, juices, <br/>\nGatorades and ate all the sandwich stuff, snack stuff and even the FOOD in the <br/>\nfreezer, then they were the ones that suffered because that amount might very <br/>\nwell have lasted them for weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey would tell their friends NOT to bring so and so over anymore, but often <br/>\ntimes when they were driving, they show up because so and so was here and <br/>\nproceed to indulge in everything they could get, without an invitation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids were sensitive to this and before this really bad summer was over all <br/>\nnon perishable snacks and stuff were in MY bedroom closet.  I hated that, the <br/>\nkids hated that.  It seemed so selfish and was really because of a very small <br/>\namount of their friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally one day my DH came home and caught some kid rummaging through my <br/>\nbedroom because he had seen the kids go in and come out with sodas so he (in his <br/>\ndisrespectful manner) was helping himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe made it CLEAR that this is NOT a free food bank, it&#39;s NOT a buffet and <br/>\nit&#39;s NOT their home, so if they are not OFFERED anything, then don&#39;t take it or <br/>\nlook for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was kinda mortifying but he had enough, so had we.  Guess what they <br/>\n&quot;offenders&quot; were not at all phased by it, they somehow feel it wasn&#39;t meant for <br/>\nTHEM, after all they are just friends of whoever, not my kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can get ugly, I&#39;m not sure of a good way to head it off.  Don&#39;t get me <br/>\nwrong we have lots of kids here all the time and I feed them, I cook specifically <br/>\nfor them, but respectful kids, kind kids, kids who are FRIENDS to my kids.  <br/>\nKids who don&#39;t think they should load up their pockets with bottles of soda to <br/>\ntake with them, or just call other people to come hang out at my house.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe let it go to far for too long when we moved here and the kids got older.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to limit other kids when yours don&#39;t need/don&#39;t get limits on food.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI will feed any child that&#39;s hungry but you have to be careful not to let <br/>\nyour house turn into the &quot;free food bank&quot; as my DH often refers to this one.  I <br/>\nonce found my next door neighbor child standing in my front door handing out 24 <br/>\nounce bottles of soda to every child within blocks that came and asked for <br/>\nit, (he came in through the kitchen door while we were gone) he was nine at the <br/>\ntime.  He thought it was a good thing to do since his Mom wouldn&#39;t let him <br/>\ngive out his food and drinks to the neighborhood...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only advice it to either hide it (which always feels wrong and stingy when <br/>\nI do it) or set ground rules early (which is hard when you don&#39;t have them <br/>\nfor your own and your kids might not understand) or limit the number of children <br/>\nat your house to a couple at a time (which seems to punish your own children <br/>\ntoo).<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to &quot;hearing&quot; creative ways others deal with this. Sometimes it <br/>\nstill is a bit of an issue here, especially with DH, I just mostly raise my <br/>\neyebrows at them and it stops anymore trips to the cupboard or fridge or <br/>\nfreezer.

One son LOVES cake, pies and ice cream type <br/>\ndesserts, one loves the fruit bar popsicle type treats, the girls, they like a very <br/>\nGOOD dessert every now and again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen other children would come over, I&#39;ve seen them eat themselves sick <br/>\neating a pile of chocolate candy that was set out.  At first I thought maybe I <br/>\nshould say something since there were eating so much, but I don&#39;t limit mine so I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t.  More than once I&#39;ve had mothers call me irate about &quot;allowing&quot; their <br/>\nchildren to eat so much candy at my house.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat to do?  Tell them they CAN&#39;T eat candy here or that they can only have <br/>\none or two pieces?  To my kids that sounded selfish and it always made the <br/>\nother kids sneak and eat it anyway.  I could put it away when certain kids were <br/>\ncoming over I guess or remind them they got sick last time and their mother <br/>\nwasn&#39;t happy?<br/>\n<br/>\nI never did find a good way to handle this, I didn&#39;t feel like it was my job <br/>\nto police other peoples children regarding candy that was sitting out. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know others wondered why MY kids didn&#39;t get sick from it, I guess because <br/>\nit WAS available they knew when they truly wanted it, they could have it.  My <br/>\n15 (yes she&#39;s officially 15 now) year old gets cravings for chocolate during <br/>\nthe month, but only wants GOOD chocolate, Godiva and her dad indulges her (and <br/>\nhimself).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids LOVE veggies, raw, cooked, they don&#39;t care they eat them.  Only one <br/>\nchild is a picky eater.  The one that was two when I was in college and my <br/>\nmother watched.  She had lots of rules regarding food.  He&#39;s going to be 22 and <br/>\nSTILL runs for the snack cupboard when he comes here, he knows he&#39;s free to take <br/>\nwhatever he chooses, eat it here or take it home, he usually does both!  My <br/>\noldest daughter finds it amusing that he&#39;s still so child like in that regard.  <br/>\nTwo weeks ago he put a Klondike bar in his jacket pocket to take home to eat <br/>\nlater.  He took off his jacket in the truck and forgot about the ice cream... <br/>\nnice mess the next day at work.  Now he takes the whole box, in a bag, no more <br/>\nforgetting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think limiting them definitely makes some children want it so much more and <br/>\nthey WILL eat themselves sick, I guess because they don&#39;t know when they will <br/>\nbe allowed any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bet there is still trick or treat candy stashed in Cait&#39;s room somewhere <br/>\nfrom last year uneaten, probably even Christmas Stocking candy, her room is due <br/>\na good spring cleaning, I&#39;m sure of it, maybe next week...<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72773,"nextTopicId":72508}}
