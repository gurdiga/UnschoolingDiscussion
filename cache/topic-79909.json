Just <br/>\nsend me an email (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jbogart@...\">jbogart@...</a>) and I&#39;ll attach it as a <br/>\nword doc.<br/>\n<br/>\nFootnotes to article: Interestingly, my daughter has moved on <br/>\nfrom her Jane Austen plans. She and her brother did attend a <br/>\nVintage Dance ball in full costume and performed all the dances <br/>\nbeautifully. The co-op we go to even hired a vintage dance <br/>\nteacher and a swing dance teacher based on my kids promotion <br/>\nof the dances.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut she is now interested in learning foreign languages, <br/>\nstudying psychology and reading lots of classic literature. So <br/>\nshe&#39;s moved on from dance, but still shows bigtime enthusiasm <br/>\nfor what drives her. She continues to act in Shakespeare plays.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son&#39;s interest in computers has continued unabated and he&#39;s <br/>\nfigured out how to spend two-to-three periods a day with the <br/>\ncomputer teacher at the local high school. He&#39;s also completed <br/>\ntwo very primitive computer games using Visual Basic (which he <br/>\ntaught himself).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rat lover of the family is the one wanting to be an animal <br/>\ntrainer, so you can see that that interest continues to drive him <br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought you&#39;d enjoy an update to go with the article if you <br/>\nend up reading it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. For women who want to discuss B-Hags with other women, <br/>\nI have a website www.trapdoorsociety.com where we share our <br/>\nown learning adventures and B-Hags. (We also have &quot;l-hags&quot; for <br/>\nthose littler more manaeable sized goals).</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79905,"nextTopicId":79866}}
