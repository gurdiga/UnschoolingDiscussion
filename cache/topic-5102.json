My sister had a best friend through the junior high and high <br/>\nschool years who was rather dominating and I felt like this letter reminded <br/>\nme of that girl.  My sister let the girl be the dominant one in the <br/>\nfriendship but it finally ended because my sister decided to go to college <br/>\nand this girl felt that it was wrong.  There were religious issues involved <br/>\nand the girl felt that my sister was not a true Christian because she was <br/>\nchoosing the things of the world by taking some classes at the community <br/>\ncollege.  (My sister had become interested in psychology.)  It ended up <br/>\nreally hurting my sister a lot and it took her many years before she was able <br/>\nto trust enough again to have close friends.<br/>\n    It seems to me that if a person isn&#39;t willing to believe in you for who <br/>\nyou are and is going to use her friendship as a leverage when you aren&#39;t <br/>\ndoing what she thinks you should do, you&#39;re probably a lot better off without <br/>\nthe friendship.  However, teens may not be able to see this and sometimes <br/>\nhave to learn on their own, painfully, unfortunately.  <br/>\n     Of course, I may be totally wrong about this girl because I don&#39;t know <br/>\nthe situation at all.  I hope they are able to mend it.  As your daughter <br/>\ncontinues learning at home, she will probably be much more independently <br/>\nminded than many of us were as teens and therefore able to choose friendships <br/>\nwhich are positive for her. <br/>\n<br/>\n     Lucy in Calif.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bonknit@xxx.xxx","from":"Bonknit@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"jNxNhLrrnYYP7wUOqFHgTqUOVE37iPtNMYcrUc1q5XxLGjRGuBJrJ8XNV-Q2mxNNzj8vs-ON","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Friend problems","postDate":"944276026","msgId":5121,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zMjcuNTEyMS45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5120,"nextInTopic":5123,"prevInTime":5120,"nextInTime":5122,"topicId":5102,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/3/99 7:08:46 PM Eastern Standard Time, andersen@spiritone.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-958322794\">In a message dated 12/3/99 7:08:46 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andersen@...\">andersen@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Thank you, thank you, thank you.
