I have been <br/>\ndoing a lot of this all along but could never pin point it, label it I guess. I <br/>\nmean the learning without reading part. It just makes so much sense, why in the <br/>\nworld can&#39;t more people see it? <br/>\n<br/>\nReading is a tool for learning but it&#39;s not all of learning. My younger son <br/>\ndoes not care to read a lot now though he can. For the last 2 years we have <br/>\nbeen listening to books on tape everywhere we go. We went from &quot;How to Eat Fried <br/>\nworms&quot; to The Lord of the Rings Trilogy&quot; to &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; and back. We <br/>\nlisten to kids books and adult books and we talk, we talk about the story, the <br/>\nwords (what are galoshes?), of the hardships (take a trip and build your own <br/>\ncanoe along the way!!) and even sex Ed (venereal disease was rampant among <br/>\nLewis and Clarks men).<br/>\n<br/>\nI once asked someone if they thought blind people are still able to learn? <br/>\n(Braille aside) (This was to illustrate my point)<br/>\n<br/>\nI love when something I read goes click, click, click in my head.
