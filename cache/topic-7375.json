We are in the process of <br/>\nadoption but as my daughter is now 11, this new baby will not be much of a <br/>\nplaymate.  My daughter also needs me to do everything with her.  Some people <br/>\nmight label that behavior &quot;dependent&quot;. Me, I don&#39;t believe in labels.  My <br/>\ndaughter  needs my companionship and I give it to her.   This has led to the <br/>\nmost beautiful and pure relationship I have ever had and I feel blessed.  <br/>\nDon&#39;t worry about your son - enjoy him and paint with him and spend as much <br/>\ntime with him as possible!  We all know they grow too fast...   jackie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7369,"nextTopicId":7356}}
