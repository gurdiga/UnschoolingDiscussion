I am a friend of<br/>\nCindi&#39;s from SOCHS.  I was completely moved and changed by your talk.<br/>\nYour explanation of what unschooling &quot;is&quot; and what it &quot;isn&#39;t&quot; clarified<br/>\nso much for me.  Most importantly it made me realize that we are living<br/>\nan unschooled life.  We had reached our goal and now we can get on with<br/>\nliving.  This was a huge moment for me as I sat listening to you with<br/>\ntears in my eyes. <br/>\n <br/>\nIf you were to talk about some of the same things you did at that<br/>\nconference and simply add Roya&#39;s point of view, I suspect that would<br/>\nanswer a lot of questions that people may have about your life as<br/>\nunschoolers and your relationship with each other.  For example, does<br/>\nRoya remember your attempt at unit studies and what did she think about<br/>\nit?   Also, new unschoolers always love to hear about the personal<br/>\njourney towards unschooling and the moment that you took that &quot;leap of<br/>\nfaith&quot;.  Does Roya remember this journey and what did it look like to<br/>\nher?  Or was she too young?  <br/>\n <br/>\nI have three children, my son Riley is 12, my son Casey is 10 and my<br/>\ndaughter Maggie is 5.  This is the first time I have posted.  I have<br/>\nbeen on this list for a little under a year now and have learned so<br/>\nmuch.  I think that it is a great idea to hear from Roya so she can<br/>\nshare her perspective.  I love to hear the parent&#39;s story, but it would<br/>\nbe fascinating to hear what your children have to say.<br/>\n <br/>\nDeanne <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n<br/>\nSecondary<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Secondary+school+education&w1=Secon\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Secondary+school+education&w1=Secon</a><br/>\ndary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+educat<br/>\nion&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chic<br/>\nago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=ZmtJ9eV8jDgLVf_rQitp3g&gt;  school<br/>\neducation <br/>\nGraduate<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Second\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Second</a><br/>\nary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+educati<br/>\non&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chica<br/>\ngo+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=_ar44lA2aVf7qUVJT2dfbA&gt;  school<br/>\neducation <br/>\nHome<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Secondary+\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Secondary+</a><br/>\nschool+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w<br/>\n4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+s<br/>\nchool+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=igfV0UPAcfSvC6KUmUYY6w&gt;  school education<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGraduate<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education+online&w1\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education+online&w1</a><br/>\n=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+<br/>\neducation&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w<br/>\n6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=OHt1qK6J19R35_4ff-oJHg&gt;<br/>\nschool education online <br/>\nHigh<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Secondary+\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Secondary+</a><br/>\nschool+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w<br/>\n4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+s<br/>\nchool+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=BV3EOkp5uIRJ0eqRAZQNcw&gt;  school education<br/>\n<br/>\nChicago<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Chicago+school+education&w1=Seconda\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Chicago+school+education&w1=Seconda</a><br/>\nry+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+educatio<br/>\nn&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicag<br/>\no+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=pesFSb8HMcPS2_oNEoEwuw&gt;  school<br/>\neducation <br/>\n <br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
