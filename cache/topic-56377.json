We go for family bike rides <br/>\nin much the same way (though my kids aren&#39;t up to riding 40 miles of <br/>\ncourse :-). But preparing a meal is more or less a stressful event <br/>\nfor me, as I am not a good cook. Baking cookies or something can be <br/>\nfun, but that&#39;s different than a daily meal. So for our family, the <br/>\nbike ride would involve far less preparation and stress and only <br/>\nminimally more equipment (you ought to see my kitchen after I cook, <br/>\nmy DH will remark &quot;Where&#39;s the battle?&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think maybe it still hasn&#39;t been explained properly by me.

My kids love to go over to <br/>\nour friends house where the mother always has a grand meal on the <br/>\ntable and it is a very special occasion. They *are* most impressed <br/>\n(and so am I!). Then again, I don&#39;t think my very, extremely active <br/>\nkids would be happy living in that house because the parents are much <br/>\nmore homebodies than we are. My kids go nuts if we stay in the house <br/>\none day, let alone every day! My strengths don&#39;t lie in cooking, but <br/>\nthey do lie in being active enough to keep up with my kids running <br/>\naround all day, taking them biking, swimming, hiking, camping, to <br/>\ntrack meets, fun runs, the beach, the mountains, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy for me to look at the way other people do things and <br/>\nconclude that my parenting is somehow lacking because I don&#39;t hand-<br/>\ncook every meal like one of my friends or hand-knit and sew all my <br/>\nkids clothes like another, or sit down and do crafts all day like <br/>\nanother, or whatever. But we can&#39;t all be everything. I think the <br/>\nbest I can hope for is to be myself, and to meet the needs of my kids <br/>\nas best as I can do. And if that means that they lack a sit-down <br/>\ndinner every night, but get to go for a family bike ride, I&#39;m sure <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be fine :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Again, maybe this doesn&#39;t become so important until the children <br/>\n </span></blockquote>are older, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but I&#39;ve always done it, or maybe it&#39;s just important for that very <br/>\n </span></blockquote>reason?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe. My mom isn&#39;t a particularly good cook, and I never missed it, <br/>\nnot even when I was older. I don&#39;t like to sit still, and I was <br/>\nalways glad not to be forced to sit down for a whole meal except on <br/>\nthose torturous holiday occasions. It really is more or less torture <br/>\nto have to sit down for an hour just to eat. I think that&#39;s okay. <br/>\nIt&#39;s okay to accept that people are wired differently and that <br/>\nsomething that is very pleasurable for one person is not particularly <br/>\nso for another. My DH is even worse. Even in a restaurant he wants to <br/>\neat as quickly as possible and have it over with. He&#39;s more of a <br/>\nfidget-body than I am, and I&#39;m sure if his childhood was being lived <br/>\nnow, he&#39;d be put on various drugs to &quot;control&quot; his hyperactive <br/>\ntendencies.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne size will never fit all, and I&#39;m glad that I got to be my kids&#39; <br/>\nparents, because our lifestyle fits them fine.
