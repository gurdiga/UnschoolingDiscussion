My 7-year-old boys have access to it <br/>\nwhenever they wish.  Personally, I don&#39;t think that a show has to be <br/>\n&quot;educational&quot; to be worthwhile - although my boys pick up new vocabulary <br/>\nfrom some of the silliest shows around - so, I suppose, all of them can <br/>\nbe viewed as &quot;educational&quot; to a certain extent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are certain shows on the Cartoon Channel like, Dexter&#39;s <br/>\nLaboratory, Tom & Jerry, Ed, Edd, & Eddie, and Justice League that my <br/>\nboys just love.  If these shows entertain them and make them happy, then <br/>\nI really don&#39;t see anything wrong with letting them watch them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly TV can be educational, but, in our house, it primarily serves <br/>\nas a form of entertainment.  There are other shows and channels they <br/>\nlove to watch, which, I guess, many other people would consider as being <br/>\nmore &quot;educational&quot;.  Some of these shows are:  History Channel <br/>\n(History&#39;s Biggest Blunders, any show about tanks, planes, battleships, <br/>\nsubmarines, GI&#39;s, Nazis,WWI, or WWII, The History of the Gun, Shows <br/>\nabout Knights, &quot;Blacksheep Squadron&quot;).  They love Animal Planet (that <br/>\ncrocodile guy), Discovery and The Learning Channel (Walking with <br/>\nDinosaurs, etc.), they also love &quot;Battlebots and Junkyard Wars&quot;.  They <br/>\nlike American Movie Classics channel because they like westerns, <br/>\nespecially JOHN WAYNE.  They like old movies like Godzilla and on Friday <br/>\nnights, there&#39;s monster fest so they get to watch &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, <br/>\n&quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;, and other old monster movies.  On <br/>\nFriday nights at 9PM there&#39;s a show called &quot;Special Effects&quot; on AMC <br/>\nwhich is a little documentary show about how the special effects of <br/>\nmovies are made - They really like that a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nTV offers them a lot of entertainment and educational stuff as well.  <br/>\nBut, believe me, that&#39;s not all they do.  They are very involved in more <br/>\nactive pastimes such as riding bikes, Legos, taking compressors, etc. <br/>\napart, helping me in the yard, kitchen and cleaning, helping their my <br/>\nhusband with his Chemistry, etc., lots of drawing, computer games, <br/>\nplaying with friends, etc.  They have very full lives and TV just <br/>\nhappens to be a part of their lives because it makes them happy.  If <br/>\nthey&#39;re happy, I&#39;m happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Join the worldís largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
