But after MUCH talk, not just my point of<br/>\nview, but a few of our friends, that have kids in our<br/>\npublic school system, he came around to my side. I<br/>\nsupported my case to him with a lot of research. I<br/>\nthink if homeschooling is that important to you, than<br/>\nyou should be able to come up with some kind of<br/>\ncompromise. Most important, you should consider your<br/>\nchild&#39;s needs. We agree that public school would ruin<br/>\nour child, at least for now. <br/>\nDanie<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

He won&#39;t even give it a chance even though the public schools out here are so bad. I&#39;m in Oregon in the united states, near Portland to be exact, and their thinking about shutting down 11 elementary schools because there is no money for them. I mean come on! Anyways, i kinda understand where your coming from. My children would rather be home schooled, since their above public school grade level, but he just thinks it&#39;s my influence. I&#39;ve just kinda given in to a compromise that they can go to public school if he gets them into a better one. We&#39;ll have to see.
