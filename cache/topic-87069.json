REALLY PLAY!  Getting down on the floor, letting your minds romp and wander, getting the crappy parts of everyday living out of your heads and losing yourselves in the moment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDrop your &quot;baggage&quot; at the door, go in and sit down with your kids and LET them show you how to play again!  No matter how long it takes, no matter how many dishes are waiting in the sink or how dirty your floors are, stay there with them until your belly aches from laughing so hard!  THAT is when the world around you sort of fades away, and it&#39;s just you and your kids having fun and PLAYING!  Laughter has a way of letting a person see things differently, and in a much brighter light.  It is, in my mind, the absolute cure for drudgery.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re a mom, not a maid, not a nanny, not a cab driver or a referee, and I don&#39;t care what your own mom told you, mom&#39;s should have fun too!  <br/>\n<br/>\nScrew the dishes, go PLAY with your kids!  If it comes time to eat and there&#39;s no dishes to eat off of...improvise, adapt, overcome!  That in itself might be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Always remember, Lead By Example***<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n___________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign-up for Ads Free at Mail.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://promo.mail.com/adsfreejump.htm\">http://promo.mail.com/adsfreejump.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":107520860,"authorName":"hmsclmyboy@aol.com","from":"hmsclmyboy@...","profile":"hmsclmyboy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] organizing","postDate":"1072803451","msgId":87100,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU5LjI0OWM0NTMuMmQyMzA4N2JAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":87098,"nextInTopic":87101,"prevInTime":87099,"nextInTime":87101,"topicId":87069,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/30/2003 7:39:52 AM Pacific Standard Time, danielle.conger@comcast.net writes: also think that Lyle needs to post more cleaning","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1567776179\">In a message dated 12/30/2003 7:39:52 AM Pacific Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danielle.conger@...\">danielle.conger@...</a> writes:<br/>\nalso think that Lyle needs to post more cleaning strategies! ;)<br/>\nAnd here I though Lyle wrote a book or something, I just realized who it is <br/>\nand I agree he needs to post more cleaning strategies.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":107520860,"authorName":"hmsclmyboy@aol.com","from":"hmsclmyboy@...","profile":"hmsclmyboy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] organizing","postDate":"1072802878","msgId":87101,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0MC4xZmE3ZjQ4Zi4yZDIzMDYzZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":87100,"nextInTopic":87103,"prevInTime":87100,"nextInTime":87102,"topicId":87069,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/29/2003 9:33:23 PM Pacific Standard Time, starsuncloud@netzero.net writes: Alright, I admit it...I think I have a crush on Lyle!!:) OK","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1908800738\">In a message dated 12/29/2003 9:33:23 PM Pacific Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> writes:<br/>\nAlright, I admit it...I think I have a crush on Lyle!!:)<br/>\nOK who is Lyle?<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164542605,"authorName":"Danielle E.

Cool.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not hard, Ren.  Whenever you&#39;re doing something (whether it&#39;s housework or anything else) and it feels boring and monotonous, stop what you&#39;re doing, look at what you&#39;re doing, and think of another way to do it.  It doesn&#39;t matter what you come up with, anything new will help.  A lot of my &#39;methods/inventions&#39; don&#39;t work, but they&#39;re still fun to come up with.  Sometimes I&#39;ll spend an hour thinking up a new way to do something that might have only taken 20 mintues to actually do.  I know that sounds crazy, but it gets me out of a rut and most of the time we have fun with the &#39;new way&#39; whether it works or not.  It gives my mind, and the kid&#39;s minds something to do.  Anyone can use a dustmop to round up dust bunnies, but try getting down on your hands and knees with a drinking straw and blowing them into a pile!  It&#39;s not effecient, but when you get the kids involved it can be a lot of fun.  The dust bunnies themselves drop way down the list of priorities, and the fun and <br/>\n creativity move to the forefront of the job.  The job turns into a game, and the rut just fades away.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not a big fan of ruts.  They&#39;re boring.  <br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Ren &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tue, 30 Dec 2003 05:28:13 GMT<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] organizing<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Floor mopping--strap some cleaning rags to your kid&#39;s feet and let &#39;em go!
