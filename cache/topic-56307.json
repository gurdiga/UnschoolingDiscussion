I opened my mouth and inserted my foot, <br/>\nhere:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The Bible doesn&#39;t say that Judas bought himself a field with the <br/>\n&gt;silver. One account has Judas hanging himself, and another account <br/>\n&gt;has him falling and bursting asunder. If you think about it, a dead <br/>\n&gt;body, after a few days, falling from the limb it was hanging on, or <br/>\n&gt;the limb breaking...it would VERY EASILY burst asunder and its <br/>\n&gt;bowels gush out. Ugh. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Have you ever read a biography of, say George Washington? Then read <br/>\n&gt;another Washington bio by a different author. would they be <br/>\n&gt;identical? no. No more than the four writers of the gospels used <br/>\n&gt;identical words...different authors, different words, different <br/>\n&gt;events highlighted. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Heidi<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ren then quoted the Bible passages about Judas, showing in Acts 1, <br/>\nwhere it says that he acquired a field with the price of his <br/>\niniquity. In fact, Ren did what I should have done: found the <br/>\npassages and examined them with her own eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra then asked if an apology to the group would be forthcoming.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my embarassment and chagrine, I did offer that apology. Once <br/>\nagain, &quot;speaking&quot; before thinking. Here is an amended apology:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If I have offended anyone on this list, by my embarassing attempt at <br/>\nanswering a critic, please accept my apology.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut may I add...if my silly reaction to the Judas question offended <br/>\nthis group, then this group is easily offended. <br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56303,"nextTopicId":56314}}
