Perhaps that is the<br/>\nsingle most remembered event when people ponder the fall of communism and<br/>\nthe end of the Cold War.<br/>\n<br/>\nA century from now, many historians could likely conclude that in terms of<br/>\nsignificance to world history, the two most important years of the 20th<br/>\ncentury are 1945 and 1989; 1945 marking the end of WW II and a radically<br/>\nchanged and politically and economically realigned world, and 1989 marking<br/>\nthe collapse of communism and another major political and economic<br/>\nrealignment.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the events of 1989 will also emerge as the most poignant modern<br/>\nexample of just how much influence average citizens can have when they<br/>\nmuster the courage to get actively involved.  Oppressive governments and<br/>\nfailed ideologies can be pulled down and swept away (even without bloodshed)<br/>\nif enough people are willing to take the risk by speaking and acting as<br/>\ntheir consciences dictate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who feel they&#39;re powerless to make changes, would do well to educate<br/>\nthemselves in the history of the events leading up to the fall of the Berlin<br/>\nWall.  That history is a message of hope, a reaffirmation that the power is<br/>\nwithin<br/>\neach and every one of us to create a better world if we are willing to put<br/>\nforth the<br/>\neffort.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Andersen<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/joandersen\">http://members.xoom.com/joandersen</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4215,"nextTopicId":4214}}
