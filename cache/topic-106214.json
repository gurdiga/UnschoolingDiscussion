It was a  bunch <br/>\nof nude sunbathers on a beach (probably France, where Holly has personal  <br/>\nexperience suggesting people are going at it everywhere, and yet these people  <br/>\nwere NOT going at it whatsoever).  Mostly men, mostly older, just being  there, <br/>\nlying in the sun with their eyes closed, and it was a distance shot  so they <br/>\nwere ...  If a computer screen were the whole photo, the people  were about the <br/>\nsize of a person&#39;s finger, and about 15 of them showed, and then  there was <br/>\nsome beach, and some cliff.<br/>\n <br/>\nNot detailed.  We were all 12/13 (early 8th grade) and one of the boys  <br/>\nbrought it.  We were taking turns looking at it and then folding it quietly  back <br/>\nand passing it on.  What was the big buzz will probably seem stupid to  some of <br/>\nthe people here.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis was a little town in northern New Mexico.  Almost all of us (over  99%) <br/>\nhad dark brown hair, or black hair (some of the Indian kids, and  half-Indian, <br/>\nsome of them brown hair too).  Few of us had much public hair  yet.  Even the <br/>\ntwo redheaded kids (one strawberry blonde, a girl from  Texas; one <br/>\ndark-red-haired boy of a really old local Hispanic family) had  dark-haired parents.   <br/>\nThere had been a blonde girl in our class  (larger class; 300 kids or so in 8th <br/>\ngrade that year) but she wasn&#39;t there that  year for some reason I don&#39;t <br/>\nremember (Martha-Ellen something; went to my  church, I sold her my piano when I <br/>\nwas 22 or so).<br/>\n <br/>\nWe were all looking at the red and blonde pubic hair. The discussion was  <br/>\nthat we hadn&#39;t realized people with light-colored hair on their heads would also  <br/>\nhave that color of public hair. I was surprised at how much pubic hair a man  <br/>\ncould have, and chest hair.   My only prior experience was of men  having <br/>\nbeards that didn&#39;t necessarily match the hair on their heads.<br/>\n <br/>\nI just realized that it was that same physical classroom we passed that  <br/>\nnude-beach photo around in that was my classroom when I was teaching sex ed to  my <br/>\nclass, and Judy K&#39;s class, and Alice Prather&#39;s class, because the other two  <br/>\nof them were too shy and clueless to begin to discuss it with them.  Never  in <br/>\nall those years have I connected those two incidents.  Room A-9, of a  school <br/>\nbuilding that was built by the WPA and is no longer classrooms.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t think kids (even boys who are touching themselves) look at porn the  <br/>\nway adults do.  I don&#39;t think our guesses of what they&#39;re thinking are  likely <br/>\nto be entirely on target.  I DO know parental reaction can screw  kids up and <br/>\nparents won&#39;t get the reaction they&#39;d hoped for (if they&#39;d thought  about <br/>\nwhat they thought their rules or shaming would get them).<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":135609248,"authorName":"Julie W","from":"Julie W &lt;jjjwoolfolk@...&gt;","profile":"juliewinar","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Porn (was kids online)","postDate":"1117247337","msgId":106231,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyOTdENzY5LjkwNjAzMDNAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFlOS4zY2RkMTM2NS4yZmM5MjIzYUBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFlOS4zY2RkMTM2NS4yZmM5MjIzYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":106230,"nextInTopic":106232,"prevInTime":106230,"nextInTime":106232,"topicId":106214,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Some  of it is just adventure/romance, and some is at least<br/>\nas graphic as romance  novels. Maybe it&#39;s for and by girls, though, I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo nights  ago I wanted to play Destruct-o-Match on Neopets. Both Marty (14)<br/>\nand Holly  (11) play Neopets, and I have an account (just so I can play  that<br/>\npattern-falling cascading game myself without having to ask Marty) and  our<br/>\nMac Powerstrip we use to get to recent files, recent programs, recent  sites<br/>\nwas FULL of porn stuff. I didn&#39;t open any, the titles themselves were  gross<br/>\nenough. OH!! I had wanted to get to Netflix to cancel getting a DVD I  had<br/>\njust rented (which didn&#39;t work).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell anyway, usually I use it  to get to Neopets games page.<br/>\n<br/>\nI called Marty in, and said &quot;Marty, this is  a bit much.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said &quot;Most of it was pop-ups mom, I didn&#39;t really look at  it all much.<br/>\nJust some.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked him if he could cover those kinds of  trails over so I didn&#39;t have to<br/>\nknow and so Holly wouldn&#39;t accidently see. I  said he needed to open a bunch<br/>\nof CLEAN websites and look at some better  stuff so that would be on the<br/>\ntrail. He told me he could delete the trail. I  said I didn&#39;t think he<br/>\ncould, that I had even asked Leon, one of the  developers, who said it only<br/>\nworks on the Mac OSX version, not 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut  Marty is a teenaged boy, so besides his porn curiosity he has a  computer<br/>\nfacility. And he figured out a three-step process to erase that list  through<br/>\nInternet Explorer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I say &quot;NO, never ever even look,&quot; I risk  losing the communication we have<br/>\nwithin which he will just tell me what he&#39;s  seen and knows and where it came<br/>\nfrom.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that story has gone two  days now. At first he was embarrassed and &quot;Mom,<br/>\nokay, I know, don&#39;t talk to  me about it anymore.&quot; So I said I wanted to talk<br/>\nto him one more time the  next day, about whether he knows the reasons people<br/>\nobject to kids looking at  porn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next day came and had nearly passed without me remembering,  when he came<br/>\nand said, &quot;Okay, mom.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You wanted to talk  to me about porn.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oh! Thanks. I hadn&#39;t remembered.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I asked  if he knew the objections. He said no. I said, &quot;In all your<br/>\nreading and  listening you haven&#39;t heard objections to porn?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, that its illegal  for me to see it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked to him about degradation of women, about  creating unhealthy and<br/>\nunreasonable expectations in marriages, and that  normal sex wasn&#39;t like that.<br/>\nHe said &quot;Well, DUH, mom!&quot; I said some people  were messed up by WANTING it<br/>\nto be. He seemed surprised that that could  happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him that some of those who are filmed are not quite  volunteers and<br/>\ntold him two stories, one of the mom of girls his age he&#39;s  known his whole<br/>\nlife, who was photographed as a kid for posed stills which  were sold out of<br/>\nOklahoma. It was shocking for him, and I don&#39;t know much  detail, but naming<br/>\na person he knew who had been victimized was effective. I  told him of a<br/>\ndrug dealer and illegal snake importer my younger half-brother  had taken up<br/>\nwith some years back, who videod him and his then-girlfriend,  and used it as<br/>\nblackmail (she was from a Mormon family) to get them to  deliver drugs for <br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I said I didn&#39;t think it was the most  horrible thing people could do, to<br/>\nlook at pictures, but he REALLY needed to  be careful because it&#39;s illegal and<br/>\nI didn&#39;t want the county coming to talk  to me about anything they were doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I had a similar moment with Holly  later that evening about going outside in<br/>\na teensy fancy t-shirt and nylon  pajama pants, no shoes, in January, while<br/>\nshe has a sore throat. &quot;Illegal,&quot; I  told her, for parents to allow that,<br/>\nand let&#39;s not draw attention to a loose  lifestyle by being outside in the<br/>\ncold without proper attire.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI told  Marty that women tend to prefer word-porn and so they don&#39;t get<br/>\ncaught, but  pictures were easy to find and more offensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him one danger was  obsession. I didn&#39;t go into that much, because<br/>\nsome of the original arguments  about obsession were the cost. I did have a<br/>\nfriend years ago who had a large  collection of porn videos that had cost him<br/>\n$60 to $80 apiece. Had he had the  internet, his obsession wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nruined his finances, nor left a  mountain of evidence to shock his mom.<br/>\n(That friend had a sex change  operation since then, so I think it was his way<br/>\nof dealing with deeper  psychological and biological situations, and that was<br/>\nway too much to tell  Marty.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I asked him if he had ANY idea how much trouble some other  boys his age<br/>\nwould get into if their parents caught them having looked at  that kind of<br/>\nstuff on the computer. He said &quot;Lots?&quot; I talked about loss of  computer<br/>\naccesss, grounding, and physical spanking by some big grown  man.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said he had been mostly embarrassed when I first talked to him  because he<br/>\nhad had friends in the house. They couldn&#39;t hear us, but he had to  leave<br/>\nwhere they were, talk to me, and go back in there, and it just  embarrassed<br/>\nhim. I said in those worst-case situations, the parents would  have called<br/>\nall of the friends&#39; parents, said to come get them, told them  why, and some<br/>\nof THEM would have been grounded and in trouble just for  hanging out with<br/>\nsomeone who had looked at porn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt he really  fully believes me on those things, or maybe he can&#39;t fathom<br/>\na parent doing  that to a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind having a kid who can&#39;t readily imagine  being hit by an angry,<br/>\ngrown man or can&#39;t imagine being told &quot;You stay in  your room for a month and<br/>\ndon&#39;t even touch a computer.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone who  has read this far and is offended, I didn&#39;t mean to throw this<br/>\nout to offend  anyone. It&#39;s a candid, current situation involving a real teen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd  usually the trail on this real teen&#39;s internet use has Neopets, AoN  (a<br/>\nrole-playing game), humor sites, and in-person friends&#39; journals.  People<br/>\nwho know Marty wouldn&#39;t think of him as a nasty kid. He&#39;s not. He is  coming<br/>\ninto adulthood, though, and he&#39;s curious.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think similar to  make-up, if it is declared &quot;only for adults,&quot; and a girl<br/>\nwaits and waits and  WAITS until she can use it and is then unlikely to just<br/>\nlet it go unused, a  boy who is slapped away from any glimpse of nudity until<br/>\nhe&#39;s eighteen is  GOING to immerse himself in his newfound access for a while<br/>\nthe moment he  gets a chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith and I were out grocery shopping, and talking about  Kirby turning<br/>\nseventeen this year. I said I used to want to have a big  eighteenth birthday<br/>\ncelebration for him, like a graduation, but I no longer  want to do that. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to declare an end to his learning, nor to his  living with us if he<br/>\nwants to stay. Keith said he had no ideas either, but  that was fine. Said<br/>\n&quot;Well, I&#39;m not going to get him drunk and take him to a  whorehouse, so<br/>\nthere&#39;s probably going to be no rite of passage.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby  wouldn&#39;t want any of that anyway. ANOTHER good thing. When he turns<br/>\neighteen,  he&#39;ll have more legal rights, but there won&#39;t be the effect of huge<br/>\ntension  released. He&#39;ll have no restrictions suddenly lifted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this won&#39;t  suit everyone&#39;s belief system, but it is working with us to<br/>\nproduce mature,  calm, considerate, communicative teenaged boys. They&#39;re not<br/>\nangry with us,  they&#39;re not reactionary, they&#39;re not  sneaky.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n-----<br/>\nquotes are other  people<br/>\n-------<br/>\n<br/>\nMsg # From:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\nDate:   Sat Jan 18, 2003  9:20 am<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; My dh has shared that he  believes that when the family is<br/>\n<br/>\nunhealthy, porn more likely beomces an  addiction to fill a hole. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree.

Roxana is involved <br/>\nin an online role-playing activity where people interact on Live <br/>\nJournal in the roles of famous literary characters. So you have <br/>\nSherlock Holmes chatting with Ender Wiggins and so on. Very cool. She <br/>\nLOVES it. Is spending 5 or 6 hours per day on it, lately.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - what&#39;s funny is that some of them have started writing real <br/>\nLETTERS to each other - in long-hand, I mean, putting them in envelopes <br/>\nand MAILING them to each other. For some of them, it just seems to be a <br/>\nnatural part of their character to want to write letters, so they&#39;re <br/>\ndoing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVE it - seeing these in the mailbox - addressed to Rox&#39;s character <br/>\nnames!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my oldest was in school, in 4th grade, they did an activity <br/>\ncalled, &quot;Hot Seat,&quot; where one person sat on a chair and the other kids <br/>\nsat on the floor around him/her. The person on the chair was supposed <br/>\nto pretend to be a character from a book the whole class was reading <br/>\nand the other kids must ask that &quot;character&quot; questions and he/she would <br/>\nanswer (in character). Some kids - maybe 2 or 3 kids - really liked it <br/>\nand got into it. The others went through the motions - they asked every <br/>\ncharacter the same few questions and they always gave the same rote <br/>\nanswers. Did their time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow there are all these people - hundreds, I think -  spending hours <br/>\nand hours pretending to be characters from literature and having <br/>\nfascinating interactions with each other. Nobody&#39;s making them do it. <br/>\nRoxana is regularly staying up until 3 am because she&#39;s enjoying it SO <br/>\nmuch that she just can&#39;t make herself stop and go to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is HER thing - she loves literary stuff - character analysis and <br/>\nso on. She&#39;s absolutely totally completely THRILLED to have discovered <br/>\nall these other people who share this passion with her. I&#39;m SO glad <br/>\nshe&#39;s not in school, being forced to do anything like this with people <br/>\nwho are NOT interested and just going through the motions, doing their <br/>\ntime!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Porn (was kids online)","postDate":"1117212751","msgId":106215,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ3N2o4ZitmZGRkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTcwMWM1NjJkNiQ3NzM3NjY5MCQ2NTAzYThjMEBqb2huPg=="},"prevInTopic":106214,"nextInTopic":106216,"prevInTime":106214,"nextInTime":106216,"topicId":106214,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
