I think people misuse or abuse them.  Some think they are a <br/>\ntrue assessment of intelligence.  (I KNOW none of YOU would think <br/>\nthat!)  They aren&#39;t.  And to make matters worse, the way the schools <br/>\nuse them and administer them makes them even worse.  I remember in <br/>\ngrade school, I would always finish first or second in my class.  I <br/>\nalways tried to be really quiet and keep turning the pages every once <br/>\nin a while because I didn&#39;t want the rest of the class to know I was <br/>\ndone.  But the other girl who was fast, used to make it very obvious <br/>\nand act all condescending about it.  I remember even then, thinking <br/>\nthat it had to make the others nervous to know she was done and they <br/>\nweren&#39;t.  I knew even then that some kids didn&#39;t test well, even <br/>\nthough they knew the material well.  My mom was tutoring a boy in my <br/>\nclass and he would know all the stuff in my house and when we got to <br/>\nschool he just could not produce it.  He nearly failed several <br/>\ngrades.  He owns a furniture store now and is very successful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom still tests mine every year.  But they think it is fun and <br/>\nkind of a game.  They also know we aren&#39;t going to love them less if <br/>\nthey don&#39;t score well.  Rachel has even learned to look at how she <br/>\nscored in different areas and use that to find what she wants to <br/>\nstudy.

Well, let me just say, in my own defense, that here in Houston, <br/>\nTexas, writing IS required on standardized tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I would like to say that with regard to reading, many unschoolers <br/>\n(certainly not all), are late readers.  Therefore, I think they will be <br/>\nmore at risk of failing standardized tests than the schooled child, <br/>\nespecially in the early grades.  I think my boys would be at risk of <br/>\nfailing these tests, not that I really care.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Saturday, December 8, 2001, at 08:57 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DACunefare@...\">DACunefare@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **Now, I only know of one or two unschooled kids who were writing at  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;grade<br/>\n&gt; level&quot; when they were 7-9 or so... most seem to pick that up a lot<br/>\n&gt; later,which seems to be natural to me...**<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **This is exactly what I was referring to when I<br/>\n&gt; brought up the subject of  unschooling kids failing standardized <br/>\n&gt; tests.**<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; HUH????<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since when do kids need writing ability for most standardized tests?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Deborah in IL<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
