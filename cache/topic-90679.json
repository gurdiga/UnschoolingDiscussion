When <br/>\nit was my turn I was talking to the lady as she was drawing blood, she asked <br/>\nme the ages of my kids and where my youngest went to school. I told her we hs&#39;d <br/>\nand she launched into several paragraphs about how organized I must be and <br/>\nhow much time it takes and how well a friend of hers did while hsing her dd. How <br/>\nthe lady worked hard to keep up with the required outline and to meet the <br/>\ntesting requirements and so on. Also how when the DD went back to school she was <br/>\nvery far ahead of her grade level. I got the impression that she believed that <br/>\ngoing back into the system is what is always in a hsing parents mind so <br/>\ntherefore we are always keeping our eye on &quot;what&#39;s required&quot; so we can stay in <br/>\nstep. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhew! I just sat there a minute and thought about it all. I then asked her if <br/>\nthis friend lived in Ohio and she said yes. I told her that Ohio regulations <br/>\nwhich have been in place since 1989 do not require any testing, it is an <br/>\noption and that we are not required to use any &quot;approved&quot; Curriculum. I also <br/>\nexplained that we don&#39;t use the school model in our home, we learn differently. (a <br/>\nlittle more more or less but this was the gist) She didn&#39;t really say much more <br/>\nand I was glad we were about finished. Sometimes when I am talking to people <br/>\nlike that I feel like we are speaking in different languages and we each know <br/>\njust a little of each others language, just enough to communicate but not <br/>\nwell. I would have loved to share how wonderful learning and life can be. <br/>\n(Actually I have to say I do know that language, I do know the school model that may <br/>\nbe why it is even harder to bridge that span, I know how long it took me and I <br/>\nwanted to do it. I knew that it wasn&#39;t going to happen in a 15minute <br/>\nconversation)<br/>\n<br/>\nI did tell her that I don&#39;t feel that what I do is a lot of work because I <br/>\nlove it, I love my kids and I love to learn so it all fits right together. Maybe <br/>\nshe will think a little. I have thought of more but I will write about it in <br/>\nanother post since it is a different subject and this is too long now.<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90677,"nextTopicId":64529}}
