I am pretty sure it was their cousin of the same age. the girls  used to treat their money-piggy banks etc. as &quot;toys&quot; and had no idea someone might take it. They just thought it was misplaced until fall-I just mentioned that maybe money should have a special place just for themselves and they might just use the change jar for games.<br/>\ngrace<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":58132404,"authorName":"MarSi77@aol.com","from":"MarSi77@...","profile":"m6hschch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [handwriting and unschooling","postDate":"1073424881","msgId":88008,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2Yi4yODYzOTg0YS4yZDJjODNmMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":88013,"prevInTime":88007,"nextInTime":88009,"topicId":88008,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/6/2004 2:19:26 PM Eastern Standard Time, ... ************************************* Ummm...not really .
