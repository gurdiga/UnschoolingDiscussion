It is known to cause<br/>\nosmotic diarrhea in adults with ingestion of 30-50g (of sorbitol),<br/>\nbecause of its incomplete absorption in the liver.  It is found in many<br/>\nsugarless gum and candies.  It&#39;s classified as noncariogenic and is<br/>\nmetabolized by the same pathway as fructose (which is metabolized in<br/>\nliver and does not require insulin to enter liver cells).  Persons with<br/>\ndiabetes should restrict their intake of sorbitol.  (Mayo Clinic Diet<br/>\nManual, 1988)<br/>\n<br/>\nSpelling and grammar: I think these tend to improve when people see<br/>\n(read) and hear lots of correct examples.  My sixth grade teacher used to<br/>\n&quot;punish&quot; the class by making us copy pages out of the dictionary! <br/>\nWriting used to be taught by copying good writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHandwriting: Mine is good if I write REALLY slow.
