then he left the room.  so i guess that&#39;s a good focus to <br/>\nhave when disciplining a child - no lies.  <br/>\n<br/>\ni would start by saying we involve rene&#39; in all decision.   this is <br/>\nbecause i believe in equality - no hierarchy.  i believe in voluntary <br/>\ninvolvement hence we have no chores list but things get done and if <br/>\nthey don&#39;t we don&#39;t sweat it.  i believe that discipline must have <br/>\nsome meaning in the child&#39;s life so that it can be internalized or <br/>\nit&#39;s an act of power and control leaving the child w/ the feeling of <br/>\noppression and invalidation i.e. anger.  i&#39;m big on talking and <br/>\nexplaining why doing something like yard work or washing dishes is <br/>\nimportant and he seem quiet willing to participate because he knows he <br/>\ncan start and stop of his own free will.  my intent is to create an <br/>\natmosphere of free will and cooperation. though we do not rely on his <br/>\nlabor&lt;g&gt;  as far as privileges go i don&#39;t know what this means.  it is <br/>\nmy belief that we all share the house and most (not all) things in it, <br/>\nmaking his use of things his right not a privilege.  time-outs are <br/>\ncontrary to my personal philosophy because it foster separation when i <br/>\nwant to foster relationship.  <br/>\n<br/>\nso now for the reality:)  does he drive me nuts - daily &lt;G&gt; but that <br/>\nseems to be diminishing and being that he&#39;s not yet 5 this is a good <br/>\nsign for things to come (the teenage years:)  so when he does <br/>\nsomething which he knows is rude or deliberately done to irritate me <br/>\n(which he takes great pleasure in:) i began by tell him why i was <br/>\nfrustrated w/ him and he would say he&#39;s sorry (which i think he&#39;s <br/>\nbeginning to see has meaning beyond the words:) now we laugh a lot at <br/>\nthe weird things he does then it dawns on him his words were rude and <br/>\nhe points it out himself and apologies.  this does not get immediate <br/>\nchange of behavior far from it but he&#39;s beginning to get the picture.  <br/>\nwhat i&#39;m trying to do is develop w/in him a compassion for others as <br/>\nwell as himself w/out fostering too much self-consciousness.<br/>\n<br/>\nthere are some issue which i believe require a firm stand.  these are <br/>\nall in the realm of safety.  so in areas like brushing teeth, crossing <br/>\nthe road, crowds, power tools..... i simply &#39;lay down the law&#39; so to <br/>\nspeak and explain why it is important to follow the rules.  now given <br/>\nthe nature of 2-5 yo&#39;s, who love to practice their autonomy,  this <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t happen smoothly but i remain consistent  e.g. brushing teeth <br/>\nwas something he didn&#39;t like being forced to do but we just kept <br/>\ntelling him why it was necessary and that there was no negotiating <br/>\nthis point and now he remind us that his teeth need to be brushed.  <br/>\nthis is true of the other area as well.  i think he has learned to <br/>\nrespect my intentions because i&#39;ve shown him time and again that i <br/>\nalways have his best interest at heart (except for coffee in  the <br/>\nmorning when it&#39;s thad&#39;s & my time &lt;g&gt; but normally he just sleeps <br/>\nthrough this:)<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan,<br/>\naustin,tx</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"C7IgUELnv95i3WEfj6_cNBvH22tyV9cOLd03UrT2Zr6QG-n1_4mFA5ALPXSNHXQLi7ICqPAVfrLFI5QAyvfFt4oB_3UfZVk4PoPYvG9SxTj6YXSeBg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] discipline","postDate":"962659870","msgId":10495,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5NjExNDJFLjIzNzYyLjFBODc5OEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ2Ljc5MjU4MzUuMjY5MjE5MDNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":10477,"nextInTopic":10505,"prevInTime":10494,"nextInTime":10496,"topicId":10430,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What I meant was that the person shunned would not gain attention by doing whatever they d done.

I know this is true in my case, <br/>\n having been raised and schooled with the tradititional <br/>\n punishment/reward system.  I am trying to rediscover the single-<br/>\n minded-ness of purpose and inner strength I am told I possessed <br/>\n as a young child, before the interference of school with it&#39;s 10-out-of-<br/>\n 10&#39;s and &#39;poor&#39; with it&#39;s peer-pressure and condescendence.  And <br/>\n so I&#39;m unschooling, hopefully to not inflict those things on my own <br/>\n children.  I said I&#39;d stay off the &#39;smacking&#39; theme, but there&#39;s one <br/>\n quote I&#39;d like to add, from Adele Faber and Eileen Mazlish and I <br/>\n forget which book of theirs it&#39;s from, or even the exact wording, but <br/>\n it&#39;s something along the lines of how sad it is that even parents <br/>\n with college-level education, supposedly intelligent people cannot <br/>\n find a way to deal effectively with their children without using <br/>\n violence.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ni think i said the above in one of my e-mails, but maybe not... anyway, this <br/>\nhas always been my opinion too... and having been similarly brought up as the <br/>\nabove poster, it&#39;s been quite a challenge for me through the years... i read <br/>\nfaber and mazlish&#39;s how to listen talk book before my son was born... it made <br/>\nso much sense and i vowed to commit to it... and have mostly through their <br/>\nlives so far with the occasional slip-up... and it&#39;s hard... really hard, <br/>\nimo... as they get beyond the 7-8 year mark... <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t use time-out or any other such form of punishment.  I <br/>\n wouldn&#39;t remove &#39;privileges&#39; (what do people regard as privileges, <br/>\n anyhow?  This is a serious question, btw, I&#39;ve never quite <br/>\n understood this term) unless they were directly involved in <br/>\n whatever, so that the &#39;removal&#39; was a direct consecquence of the <br/>\n action, like when the kids wouldn&#39;t tidy up their stuff, so they put it <br/>\n in bin-bags and I said it had gone to the dustbin-dragon.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nwe do that with our daughter... but it really doesn&#39;t work... she&#39;s 11, and <br/>\nhas had probably 30 brown paper bags of her stuff in the basement... that she <br/>\nnever missed...lol... she is a kid who works with what she has and never <br/>\ncomplains... so now i&#39;ve tried a new approach... i&#39;ll let you know if it <br/>\nworks... i learned about it in Ed Psyche this year... get this, i go into her <br/>\nbedroom when she&#39;s in there and exclaim,&quot;my goodness, abby, you are such a <br/>\nneat child... i&#39;m so happy to see how organized you are ... and i&#39;m impressed <br/>\nwith how you stay with it all the time... she thinks i&#39;m being sarcastic and <br/>\ngets mad sometimes... now she&#39;s at the point where she laughs about it... <br/>\naccording to my prof. and the book, there&#39;s a good chance she will eventually <br/>\nlive up to my &quot;accusations&quot;... it sure feels better than screaming, yelling, <br/>\npunishing and even taking her stuff away... but it&#39;s hard to live with the <br/>\nfilth, i admit... we take away privileges when... well, let&#39;s see... it&#39;s <br/>\nusually for a pretty big infraction... like when my 14 year old went to a <br/>\nfriend&#39;s house after school and didn&#39;t tell me or the school... the school <br/>\nassumed he got on the bus... they found out... he was given detentions ... i <br/>\nasked him what he thought i should do about it... and we decided on loss of <br/>\nphone privileges for a week(a very big deal to him)... both my kids lose <br/>\nprivileges for chronic mouthing off, lying, not doing what they&#39;re told like <br/>\nthe 3rd time... but they know when they do it what the consequence is... i&#39;ve <br/>\neven been asked by my daughter what the consequence would be if she called me <br/>\na &quot;bitch.&quot; lol... she wanted to know if it was worth the joy i suppose...<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt; That&#39;s a <br/>\n direct consequence. and they chose to put their stuff in the <br/>\n rubbish.  And I don&#39;t use star-charts or anything like that either.  If <br/>\n anyone&#39;s interested in a good book on the subject of training, I <br/>\n particularly like Don&#39;t Shoot the Dog, by Karen Pryor (I think)  I got <br/>\n it from my local LLL group library.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>i tried the charts when they were little... never worked... rewards and <br/>\npunisments don&#39;t work and like you said, they transfer intrinsic motivation <br/>\nto extrinsic... that&#39;s one of the main reasons my daughter&#39;s going to <br/>\nhomeschool next year... wayyyyy too much of her motivation is extrinsic... <br/>\n<br/>\nJeanne<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rainforest.care2.com/front.html/player815&quot;\">http://rainforest.care2.com/front.html/player815&quot;</a>&gt;Join Care2.com&#39;s <br/>\nRace for the Rain Forest!&lt;/A&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10897,"nextTopicId":10471}}
