We live in Pittsburgh, PA.<br/>\n<br/>\n I knew that I would homeschool as soon as I learned (sometime in my 20&#39;s I think)that it was legal.  I was one of those unhappy straight-A students that were being discussed recently -- I knew that I didnt&#39; want that for my children.  I had in mind a far more &quot;schooly&quot; version of homeschooling, however.   Now, as I watch myu children grow and learn it is clear that unschooling is the path most compatible with the way we live and our beliefs about the treatment of children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to participating in this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -Cat <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Intro","postDate":"1019847727","msgId":36147,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY1M3h5NERsWVd5NlBodVFpbk8wMDAwMTE5MUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":80464,"prevInTime":36146,"nextInTime":36148,"topicId":36147,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
