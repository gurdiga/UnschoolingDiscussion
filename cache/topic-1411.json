I have heard about kids that love workbooks and enjoy the<br/>\nstructure of knowing exactly what they can do this minute. Others learn<br/>\nbetter with freedom to learn when and what they want to. The idea of<br/>\nunschooling is to let the child learn  in the way that is best for them at<br/>\nthe moment and to not become frustrated and agitated when their style of<br/>\nlearning changes.(That also means not buying workbooks for the next 12 years<br/>\nat one shot. Your child&#39;s desire to work in them may change very quickly.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy T. in Alberta</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Ewa","from":"&quot;Ewa&quot; &lt;sciezka@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"RrNCsPaLhxeo3PuIw1IsLQuaEUqYLSRqILI2J85_H4oHcv5YB0dCD5UNHm0c2jlS2Y6wQM18ZmBF3llVmpnpGEsjaYeIqPY","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Unschooling for every child?","postDate":"931111465","msgId":1411,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xMDYuMTQxMS45NTkyNjk3NDBAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1418,"prevInTime":1410,"nextInTime":1412,"topicId":1411,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I love the unschooling idea.
