That seems so strange coming from where we live.<br/>\nThe entire field behind our house is full of them, as is every roadside,<br/>\nabandoned garden shed, or anyplace that someone hasn&#39;t actively planted<br/>\nsomething else or mowed them down. They may be nuisances (I have to cut them<br/>\nout of my garden a thousand times a year) but ummmmm.... are they great!<br/>\nAs for the finest blackberries on earth, they grow in Jacksonville, OR.<br/>\nwhich must have the perfect climate for them. Bigger than a big thumb and<br/>\njuicy and sweet. Yumm!
