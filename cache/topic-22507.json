Have you looked up the laws for your state at NHEN?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would, however, be real cautious when discussing anything with someone who<br/>\nworks for CPS, be they a friend or not.  Sometimes folks who do certain jobs<br/>\nbecome consumed by the job.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve done work with families that have had dealings with CPS and found that<br/>\npolite but firm and confidant work best.

He needs some routine and structure, but not the sit at<br/>\n&gt; his desk and do worksheets all day. I do want some though. I would<br/>\n&gt; like to work moree in areas he enjoys to keep his interest. If any<br/>\n&gt; one has any favorite sites you would like to share I would sure<br/>\n&gt; appreciate it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, I have been told by a friend, (cps worker) that I should count<br/>\n&gt; on being turned in since he is special needs. She said she would<br/>\n&gt; be the one sent and just keep good records. My question is has any<br/>\n&gt; one been turned into CPS for homeschooling? and what kind of records<br/>\n&gt; should I keep. There are no specifics here that I have been told<br/>\n&gt; or read, just have to have 180 days of school.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Linda </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22482,"nextTopicId":22496}}
