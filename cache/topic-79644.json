We turn our thinking around from making them do what we want or<br/>\nwhat we think they&#39;re supposed to, to seeing our role as their partner in<br/>\ntheir exploration of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than making him shower, suggest that if he wants to go somewhere that<br/>\nhe&#39;ll offend people if he smells.

Not as a favor to him, but because<br/>\nyou want to and because it will help him get a feel for the benefits of<br/>\norganizaiton and how to go about it.

And do you feel<br/>\n these lessons/activities are enjoyable and/or useful?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is working for my kids right now isn&#39;t what was working last year. My<br/>\nkids that are unschooled are 8, 7 and almost 3. Last year they were<br/>\nperfectly happy to do a homeschool sports camp one day a week for 3 hours<br/>\nand then maybe have a friend over once a week and the rest of the time hang<br/>\nout with me, either out or home. Preferably at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow they enjoy the outtings more. We will be doing park day every Tues.<br/>\nstarting next week. I think it&#39;s something they will want to do every week.<br/>\nWe do craft day every Wed. at a friends house and then have plenty of play<br/>\ntime after we do the craft. Fridays will again start their sports day in a<br/>\ncouple of weeks. So that will be 3 days of doing things outside the house<br/>\nwith other kids on a regular basis. We&#39;ll see how that goes. Of course the<br/>\nyoungest doesn&#39;t do the sports day but she does do the park and crafts. This<br/>\nis the most my kids have done so far on a regular basis. I&#39;m figuring that<br/>\nwill eventually change too depending on their needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n I know they will give up park day and craft day if other things come up,<br/>\nlike more interesting field trips with our group or fun stuff with mom and<br/>\ndad. I know from experience they are not willig to give up their Fridays and<br/>\nsports though. In between, as they like, we will do water park and friends<br/>\nover too. My kids still are at the point though where too much away from<br/>\nhome is not to their liking. A few hours 3 days a week are just enough so<br/>\nfar.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79642,"nextTopicId":79632}}
