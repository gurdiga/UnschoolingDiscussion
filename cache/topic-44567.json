The whole idea is that the kids know that it <br/>\nis truly their decision which is not possible if you ease in (which<br/>\nmeans keeping some control). It is funny...I got rid of all tv rules <br/>\nabout 2 weeks ago. Things have been going pretty well. I have found that<br/>\nif I go outside to work in the yard or suggest that we do something together<br/>\nthey are more likely to turn off the tv and join me then before when we<br/>\nhad restrictions (when nothing I said could get them to join me if they <br/>\nwere watching tv, I guess because they knew that they only had a short time<br/>\nto watch). I have also noticed that Jason (my oldest) does not sit absolutely<br/>\nglued to the tv anymore...he is more likely to be playing with his legos or <br/>\nother toys while watching.

They had turned<br/>\nthe tv off and wanted to play trains. :o) Go figure. <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday was actually a very eye opening &quot;unschooling at work&quot; day. It started out<br/>\nnot so great. I was trying to get the kids out of the house so that I could run an<br/>\nerrand (I wanted to get it over with so we could do whatever we wanted the rest of <br/>\nthe day). They were dragging their feet and we did not get going until around 1.<br/>\nThe store we went to was near a Zany Brainy so of course Jason wanted to go. My first<br/>\nreaction was no, because we had not come out to go there. But then I realized there<br/>\nreally was no real reason not to stop in. So we stopped in to check out the legos.<br/>\nDidn&#39;t know how much money he had at home, plus we have a lego outlet near us, so he<br/>\ndecided to wait before buying anything. Came home. I had thought that we would try to<br/>\nget together with his best friend since he hasn&#39;t seen much of him since school started<br/>\nbut Jason got on the computer. I kept nagging him and getting more and more upset that <br/>\nhe was not doing anything to help get ready to go. Finally realized that it really was<br/>\nhis choice. As soon as I made that realization, the day got much better. I asked<br/>\nKyle if he wanted to go outside. I started weeding and Kyle started playing. In about <br/>\n15 mins Jason came out and started playing with Kyle. Then they helped me dig holes<br/>\nand I transplanted some plants. Came back in and instead of turning on the tv, Jason<br/>\nasked me if we could put on some music. He choose my Cats cd (I love broadway shows)<br/>\nand we moved the coffee table over and they did some great dancing! (we also talked about<br/>\nwhat an overture is). While dancing, Kyle (my 2.5 yo) went over to one speaker and put<br/>\nhis head down to listen, ran over to the other speaker and listened, and then went back <br/>\nto the first one. Jason did the same thing and asked me why sound was coming out of<br/>\nboth speakers. I started playing with the balance which they thought was really cool.<br/>\nWe had dinner and when I added Jason&#39;s soccer schedule to the calendar, Jason wanted<br/>\nto look at it and started naming off the days of the week (he knew sun, mon and tues).<br/>\nThen after dinner Kyle found my calculator and was punching random numbers into it. Jason<br/>\nasked me what the number was...it was -2.34556 or something like that. Then Jason <br/>\nwanted to know what a negative number was. I went and googled it and found an explanation<br/>\nwith a number line, so we talked about it a little while. SO basically once I gave up<br/>\ncontrol of the day it went great LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am just absolutely amazed at how Jason&#39;s mind works.

So far, so good I think....I may <br/>\npost more about this later.

The whole trusting your boys issue <br/>\nwill come with time. Some people seem to get it right away, although I think <br/>\neveryone has their doubts in some way or another every now and then. The <br/>\nimportant thing is to not act on it right away and you usually find the kids <br/>\nare fine before you get too much of a chance to really think about your <br/>\ndecision. If there is a restriction you are thinking of eliminating, I guess <br/>\nthe best thing is to just jump right in there. Easing into it really defeats <br/>\nthe purpose.

And that is <br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t like them sleeping until noon because we won&#39;t get out and <br/>\ndoing things that we all enjoy doing.

My name is Stephanie, married to dh Jeff and we have two boys, <br/>\n  Jason (5.5 yo, will be 6 in Dec) and Kyle (2.5 will be 3 in Feb). Jason did go to <br/>\n  a very relaxed play-based preschool for 2 years (2.5 hrs 3 days/week the first year<br/>\n  and 4 days/week the second). At that time I had just started really considering hsing<br/>\n  and last year I still had not convinced Jeff. Finally convinced him and here we are.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have to admit that I am having very similar feelings as I did when I found an <br/>\n  Attachment Parenting board when my oldest was a year old. I was amazed to find<br/>\n  that there were people who were raising kids the way that my heart was telling <br/>\n  me too and that they weren&#39;t spoiling or ruining them like everyone told me that<br/>\n  I would LOL! I met my first hsers online at that site and at the time thought <br/>\n  that it was great for others, but not for me. But as time went on, I realized <br/>\n  that I couldn&#39;t not hs - it just makes too much sense to me and seems like<br/>\n  a natural extension of my parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I started researching online, trying to get a feel for curriculums and options. <br/>\n  Read tons and tons of books. Even checked out 100 EZ lessons for teaching your<br/>\n  child to read but couldn&#39;t get past the directions that said that I had to read<br/>\n  the pages *exactly* as they were written or I would mess it up. I decided that<br/>\n  even if it might work for Jason it was just too structured for *me*! I found<br/>\n  unschooling.com a few months ago and have been reading the archives like crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can&#39;t tell you how many Ah-Ha! moments I have been having. My hubby thinks that <br/>\n  I have lost it because I have been staying up late just reading, reading and <br/>\n  reading. Trying to take it all in. I feel pretty comfortable with unschooling,<br/>\n  although I am finding that I still need to work on my mental checklists...I<br/>\n  am still seeing things in semi-schoolish terms. But I think that will change<br/>\n  with time and seeing my boys continue to blossom. What I am really trying to <br/>\n  wrap my mind around is letting go and trusting the boys in other areas. I just <br/>\n  removed all restrictions on tv 2 weeks ago (wasn&#39;t much to remove...when Jason was<br/>\n  younger, we had a 1 hr limit, which had gradually changed to a no tv in the morning<br/>\n  rule). So far, so good I think....I may post more about this later. I really<br/>\n  want to get rid of the restrictions on junk food (this is a major issue lately)<br/>\n  but hubby will take a little more convincing. I am also actively looking at other<br/>\n  ways that I try to control the boys and rethinking what I am trying to accomplish.<br/>\n  The funny thing is that I have always been one of the most relaxed (when it comes<br/>\n  to rules) moms of all my friends! I don&#39;t use &quot;time outs&quot; (although I do remove<br/>\n  Jason from a situation if needed and try to help him calm down), don&#39;t force my <br/>\n  kids to say sorry (although Jason is actually pretty good about doing this himself),<br/>\n  and generally try to limit my nos. This list has helped me realize that I really <br/>\n  can do an even better job at that. I think that I read someone here (or on<br/>\n  the boards) who posted about trying to be an advocate for their child to get what they<br/>\n  want out of life, rather then being the person who stands in their way. This really<br/>\n  spoke to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, this is getting long. I have so much I want to say and so little time to say it<br/>\n  in! I definitely have lots of questions as I try to sort through everything. I still have<br/>\n  a long way to go, but I am getting there, I think. The thing that really gets me is how<br/>\n  much *fun* this is! I feel so guilty some days, especially when I talk with my friends<br/>\n  with kids in school. But they all think that I am nuts anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for reading so far and thank you for sharing this wonderful way of life with me!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Stephanie in Virginia (Yes another one!
