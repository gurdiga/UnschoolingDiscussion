I&#39;ve been working as a university art professor for over 20 years and have found this to be true even at the MFA level. The most important part of any application to an studio art-related program will be the portfolio. Different programs have varying standards. The best way to prepare is to meet someone the Art Institute Faculty who deals with admissions of students and find out more about their expectations. At many institutions, stated admission standards are frequently reconsidered to accommodate non-traditional students. <br><br>I meet with many students interested in applying to our programs at all levels. We tour facilities, meet other faculty and students. We also review their portfolio materials so I can make suggestions for improvement. It gives me a chance to meet prospective students in person and to find out about them in ways that neither scores, nor portfolios, can provide. On the flip side, the students get a chance to see if working with me, and other faculty they might meet, feels like a good fit for them.<br><br><div>In this situation, if admission to the Art Institute is the goal, a meeting with a faculty member or adviser there should clarify what, if anything, the person needs to do before applying.<br></div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;ll share a personal story: Back when I was applying for graduate school I took a road trip visiting prospective programs and happened to visit one university when they had already sent my rejection letter. In spite of that bad news I spent a few days to meet faculty and students, and to learn more about the program. During my visit a couple of the faculty members I met petitioned successfully to accept me into the MFA program. I ultimately accepted an offer from different university though, because during my visit I realized that the fit wasn&#39;t the best for me.<br><br></div>Tori<br></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Preparing for college","postDate":"1445920484","msgId":76260,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQxRDA4QzE0LUZCNUUtNDU4QS05NDc5LTI3QTFDRTNBNTAwREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTQwNS1FQVM5NzFFRDY5QTFENEZBMEJBMDQ1MENBRDcyMjBAcGh4LmdibD4=","referencesHeader":"PG4wajdqbCsxMXNpODFiQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDgyNDc0OEMwLUVDRDUtNEJDMC04RDY1LTk2NDMyRTdBRjVEQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPG4wamU3aCsxNGh0Yzd2QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPENBT09UYVhQZ0xYTVZQTEdycVdEWkZkPUVIZCtFY1EzZlY5Y0ZQWHp3Vm5YQXlBXzh0d0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPG4wbWk0cytyM2dwdGxAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QkFZNDA1LUVBUzk3MUVENjlBMUQ0RkEwQkEwNDUwQ0FENzIyMEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":76259,"nextInTopic":76261,"prevInTime":76259,"nextInTime":76261,"topicId":76249,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-If she truly wants to go the college route I would encourage her to take the placement tests at your community college to find out how much remedial help","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-211864508\">-=-If she truly wants to go the college route I would encourage her to take the placement tests at your community college to find out how much remedial help she actually needs.

We need concise ways for her to get through all she needs, not only to succeed on the SAT, but to be able to be successful in college. </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"color:white;clear:both;\"></div>\n\n\n\n</div></blockquote></span></blockquote></div>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":469232503,"authorName":"dh.family@frontier.com","from":"&quot;dh.family@...&quot; &lt;dh.family@...&gt;","profile":"whopki1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Preparing for college","postDate":"1445833677","msgId":76254,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2Njc1MTEyMDYuMzExMjMwMC4xNDQ1ODMzNjc3NDk5LkphdmFNYWlsLnlhaG9vQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PG4wajdqbCsxMXNpODFiQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG4wajdqbCsxMXNpODFiQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76253,"nextInTopic":76255,"prevInTime":76253,"nextInTime":76255,"topicId":76249,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Susan, My daughter is preparing to take the SAT s in two weeks.  She was unschooled until 11th grade when she wanted to go to public high school as a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597\"><html><head></head><div style=\"color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yiv3088859763\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yui_3_16_0_1_1445827156953_7969\"><div style=\"color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yui_3_16_0_1_1445827156953_7968\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yiv3088859763\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yiv3088859763yui_3_16_0_1_1445829953483_3758\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yiv3088859763yui_3_16_0_1_1445829953483_3757\" style=\"color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yiv3088859763yui_3_16_0_1_1445829953483_3774\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yiv3088859763yui_3_16_0_1_1445829953483_4047\">Hi Susan,</span></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yiv3088859763yui_3_16_0_1_1445829953483_3774\"><span><br clear=\"none\"></span></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yiv3088859763yui_3_16_0_1_1445829953483_3774\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yui_3_16_0_1_1445827156953_7970\">My daughter is preparing to take the SAT&#39;s in two weeks. &nbsp;She was unschooled until 11th grade when she wanted to go to public high school as a junior, and now as a senior. &nbsp;She has never liked reading or done any for pleasure. &nbsp;She wasn&#39;t even planning on college for sure till a few weeks ago, and now we go on college tours every weekend, trying to learn a lot in a short time.</span></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yiv3088859763yui_3_16_0_1_1445829953483_3774\"><span><br clear=\"none\"></span></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yiv3088859763yui_3_16_0_1_1445829953483_3774\">Just last night I picked up the SAT prep book I bought at her request, and it was so interesting. &nbsp;It gave all the tricks for how to do well on the test (when to guess, how to pace yourself, which questions to spend the most time on, etc.). &nbsp;They said that the questions are easy, medium and hard - and that the last group are so hard that almost no one can answer them. &nbsp;That made me feel better! &nbsp;They make it this way so that most students fall into the middle of the scoring section. &nbsp;If your daughter takes a practice online or in a book, she will get an idea of the kind of questions. &nbsp;I was surprised when I looked at a practice test last night and actually knew many of the answers. &nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yiv3088859763yui_3_16_0_1_1445829953483_3774\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yiv3088859763yui_3_16_0_1_1445829953483_3774\" dir=\"ltr\">I was told to buy the Princeton Review SAT book - and just reading the very beginning and the tips they gave in the first two sections, was very helpful. &nbsp;It felt like it was worth the price of the book. &nbsp;It gave me the confidence that I could do reasonably well with the great suggestions they had, if I had to take the SAT again for some reason. &nbsp;It is a huge book, and I may not read past the first few pages, but feel I learned so much already.</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yiv3088859763yui_3_16_0_1_1445829953483_3774\" dir=\"ltr\"><br></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yiv3088859763yui_3_16_0_1_1445829953483_3774\" dir=\"ltr\">I agree with others that low scores will not eliminate your daughter&#39;s chances of pursuing her dreams.

My daughter Holly is almost 18 now and has been unschooled pretty much her whole life. During that time, she has not ventured into learning much at all that would prepare her to get her GED and take the SATs. She&#39;s always wanted to be a chef so wasn&#39;t worried about those kinds of things. Now though, she&#39;s decided to go into interior design and wants to attend the Art Institute. She has always struggled as a reader and does not enjoy it at all. How have any of you handled this? We&#39;ve picked up a SAT prep book and it&#39;s HUGE and completely overwhelming. How do we fit 8+ years of school into 2 or 3?&nbsp;</span></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-12906597yiv3088859763yui_3_16_0_1_1445829953483_3765\"><span>Thanks so much,&nbsp;</span></div><div

There are also several free online samples of the test you can download and take. We started out with the SAT but switched to the ACT when we determined my daughter did better with it. The other trick with these tests that was helpful for us was to focus on a specific score to shoot for and not to try for 100 percent. For instance 24 is a good enough score on the ACT for most colleges and for that score you can miss 1 out of ever 3 questions. So my daughter found it much less stressful knowing she miss over 70 questions and still be ok.

A portfolio of her work and a letter saying she was homeschoooled (maybe describe unschooling and some of her activities and interests in words you can find here:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.co/unschoolingcurriculum\">http://sandradodd.co/unschoolingcurriculum</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople take SAT tests without being out of high school all the time, so I don’t see why a GED would be necessary.  I bet if your daughter too the SAT test she would do better than either of you think.  It might be enough right there.   If not, she could study just the section(s) in which she scored low, and retake the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon’t believe, though, that schools never admit exceptions.

My daughter Holly is almost 18 now and has been unschooled pretty much her whole life. During that time, she has not ventured into learning much at all that would prepare her to get her GED and take the SATs. She&#39;s always wanted to be a chef so wasn&#39;t worried about those kinds of things. Now though, she&#39;s decided to go into interior design and wants to attend the Art Institute. She has always struggled as a reader and does not enjoy it at all. How have any of you handled this? We&#39;ve picked up a SAT prep book and it&#39;s HUGE and completely overwhelming.
