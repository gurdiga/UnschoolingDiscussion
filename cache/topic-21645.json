This is long, but gave me a chuckle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA few months ago, when I was picking up the children<br/>\nat school, another mother I knew well rushed up to<br/>\nme. Emily was fuming with indignation. &quot;Do you<br/>\nknow what you and I are?&quot; she demanded. Before I<br/>\ncould answer and I didn&#39;t really have one handy -<br/>\nshe blurted out the reason for her question.<br/>\nIt seemed she had just returned from renewing her<br/>\ndriver&#39;s license at The County Clerk&#39;s office.<br/>\nAsked by the woman recorder to state her occupation,<br/>\nEmily had hesitated, uncertain how to classify<br/>\nherself. What I mean is,&quot; explained the recorder,<br/>\n&quot;do you have a job, or are you just a .....?&quot; &quot;Of<br/>\ncourse I have a job,&quot; snapped Emily. &quot;I&#39;m a mother.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;We don&#39;t list &#39;mother&#39; as an<br/>\noccupation...&#39;housewife&#39; covers it,&quot;said the<br/>\nrecorder emphatically.<br/>\n<br/>\nI forgot all about her story until one day I found<br/>\nmyself in the same situation, this time at our own<br/>\nTown Hall. The Clerk was obviously a career woman,<br/>\npoised, efficient, and possessed of a high-sounding<br/>\ntitle like &quot;Official Interrogator&quot; or &quot;Town<br/>\nRegistrar.&quot; &quot;And what is your occupation?&quot; she<br/>\nprobed. What made me say it, I do not know. The<br/>\nwords simply popped out. &quot;I&#39;m a Research Associate<br/>\nin the field of Child Development and Human<br/>\nRelations.&quot; The clerk paused, ball-point pen frozen<br/>\nin midair, and looked up as though she had not heard<br/>\nright. I repeated the title slowly, emphasizing<br/>\nthe most significant words. Then I stared with<br/>\nwonder as my pompous pronouncement was written in<br/>\nbold,black ink on the<br/>\nofficial questionnaire. &quot;Might I ask,&quot; said the<br/>\nclerk with new<br/>\ninterest,&quot;just what you do in your field?&quot; Coolly,<br/>\nwithout any trace of fluster in my voice, I heard<br/>\nmyself reply, &quot;I have a continuing program of<br/>\nresearch (what mother doesn&#39;t) in the<br/>\nlaboratory and in the field (normally I would have<br/>\nsaid indoors and out). I&#39;m working for my Masters<br/>\n(the whole darned family) and already have four<br/>\ncredits (all daughters). &quot;Of course, the job is one<br/>\nof the most demanding in the humanities (any mother<br/>\ncare to disagree?) and I often work 14 hours a day<br/>\n(24 is more like it). But the job is more<br/>\nchallenging than most<br/>\nrun-of-the-mill careers and the rewards are in<br/>\nsatisfaction rather than just money.&quot; There was an<br/>\nincreasing note of respect in the clerk&#39;s voice as<br/>\nshe completed the form, stood up, and personally<br/>\nushered me to the door.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I drove into our driveway, buoyed up by my<br/>\nglamorous new career, I was greeted by my lab<br/>\nassistants - ages 13, 7, and 3. Upstairs I could<br/>\nhear our new experimental model (6 months) in the<br/>\nchild-development program, testing out a new vocal<br/>\npattern. I felt triumphant! I had scored a beat on<br/>\nbureaucracy! And I had gone on the official records<br/>\nas someone more distinguished and indispensable to<br/>\nmankind than &quot;just another mother.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMotherhood...what a glorious career. Especially when<br/>\nthere&#39;s a title on the door.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether a<br/>\nstay at home Mom or a career Mom, we should all<br/>\ncarry this title.<br/>\nThe Images of Mother:<br/>\n4 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mommy can do anything!<br/>\n8 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mom knows a lot!
