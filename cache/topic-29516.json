First mom&#39;s:<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has been the cantor at her church for more than 25 years -- everyone there knows her beautiful voice. She loves to watch couples get married, bring their babies to be baptized, and then grow up themselves. One Sunday last year, she sat in front of a family with three young children, all of whom were wiggly and giggly. Mom almost reminded the young mother that the church had a &quot;cry room,&quot; but she remembered trying to get through an hour with 4 little ones, so she opted not to say anything. At the end of mass, the woman reached up to mom, touched her on the shoulder, and said, &quot;Petie, I know you don&#39;t know me, but I have come here every Sunday for three years. I have always enjoyed your singing. You are special because you have never said anything but kind things to me and my children. We are moving today and I just wanted to say good by and thank you for your patience.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nDad&#39;s story:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Vietnam, he was training paratroopers and jumped with them regularly into training drop zones. One time, the winds were high, he was heavier than the lighter South Vietnamese men, and he landed high up in a tree. As he was struggling to get himself untangled, he heard footsteps approaching. He saw a lone figure and suspected that it was a North Vietnamese scout. He tried to reach his sidearm, but it and his arm were pinned to his side. He had intended to shot the man. Dad held his breath and waited for the slow-moving man to get past. Suddenly, the man looked up and saw dad. In an instant, dad recognized him as a South Vietnamese follow officer who was trying to find him to help him back to safety. Whenever dad told this story, he always got quiet as though the magnitude of the choice he had been willing to make, but thankfully had been unable to, washed over him anew.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, we never <br/>\nknow whose lives our words may touch. ..  pretty cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you judge someone you are not defining them, you are defining yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Yahoo!

When we first moved here, my daughter decided she would <br/>\ngo to school. We looked around quite a bit and found one as suitable to <br/>\nunschooling as we could find. . . a very small Montessori. We became friends <br/>\nwith the family but had sort of fell out of touch lately. Yesterday, the mom <br/>\nfound me via unschooling.com message boards, which she is reading <br/>\nvoraciously, trying to figure out a solution for her daughter who is <br/>\nabsolutely miserable in school. She told me yesterday, she felt as though I <br/>\nwas an answer to her prayers, and how it was no accident we met a couple of <br/>\nyears ago. She needs someone to help her on this journey, and I am so <br/>\ngrateful to have that opportunity. Her daughter needs to see other girls her <br/>\nage who are &quot;normal&quot; (not sure if I can classify Lil as that LOL, she says. . <br/>\nthats true) and are leading an unschooling life, although at this point, they <br/>\naren&#39;t too sure what that is, based on things she has said. I am sure after <br/>\nreading the message boards she will get a clearer picture. I think she <br/>\nsearched unshcooling because she had heard me mention it.
