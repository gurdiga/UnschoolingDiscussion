I want my daughters to see <br/>\nthat being a wife, mother, teacher, secretary etc. is something that they can <br/>\ncertainly do and be content and happy at doing/being rather than following <br/>\nalong with a hurtful &quot;You don&#39;t HAVE to be a nurse, wife, mother, etc.&quot; (which <br/>\nrather denigrates their choice to be a nurse, wife, teacher, etc.) and thus <br/>\nbecoming something they don&#39;t truly enjoy because women &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot; choose <br/>\ntraditional roles any longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth in MA<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for saying this, Elizabeth, because I was feeling the same way but <br/>\ndidn&#39;t quite know how to express it.  I had a few things I wanted to be <br/>\ngrowing up because of books I had read that made those careers sound glamorous, but <br/>\nin my heart all I&#39;ve really ever wanted to be was a mother and a wife.  That <br/>\nis frowned upon in today&#39;s society, and guess what?  I DON&#39;T CARE.  If I did, I <br/>\ncertainly wouldn&#39;t have homeschooled, and CERTAINLY wouldn&#39;t be unschooling.  <br/>\nI tried to go back to college and finish my degree in early childhood <br/>\neducation, but even in college, learning just doesn&#39;t take it to the level I&#39;m <br/>\ninterested in.  With unschooling my son, we&#39;ve been able to take things to the <br/>\ndeepest level he wants to and in untraditional ways, so that he actually remembers <br/>\nwhat he is learning.  Quite often I find myself going even deeper on my own <br/>\nbecause I can-I don&#39;t have to rush off to the next area to &quot;keep up with my <br/>\nclass&quot;.  What is important to me is to let my children know they have <br/>\nchoices-choices to be anything that makes them happy-whether traditional or <br/>\nnontraditional.  If we were to follow it with &quot;you don&#39;t HAVE to be a nurse, secretary,&quot; <br/>\netc, then we are imposing and impression that is not fair and balanced and <br/>\ncounteracts all we&#39;ve worked hard to accomplish in deschooling/unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83683,"nextTopicId":15330}}
