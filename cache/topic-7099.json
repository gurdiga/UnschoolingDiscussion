I<br/>\n get the feeling that unschooling would be much less casual than this<br/>\n focused time I have been spending.<br/>\n <br/>\n In your opinion, what are some things I should be doing.  And should I<br/>\n continue what I am doing, since she enjoys it so much? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCarli --<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you are doing great!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 5 yo daughter just sailed thru the room so I will tell you what she did <br/>\ntoday as an example:<br/>\n<br/>\nShe just walked out and announced that she is &quot;carrying 3 things at a time&quot; <br/>\n-- and I am to watch and now we are going to play with the doll and play the <br/>\ngame she just made up about bowling -- it continues from here -- until 3:30 <br/>\nor so when we have to leave for big brother&#39;s Tae Kwon Do lesson.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore that she babysat the guinea pig while I cleaned out his cage.  She <br/>\ndecided he needed a snack and got him some Cheerios and water.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore that we watered the vegetable/flower garden and the NASA Seeds Project <br/>\nwe have going -- tomato seeds that have been up on the space shuttle, free <br/>\nand fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore that she played in the sand box.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Chinese checkers.  And some cartoons (of course!).  And helped with <br/>\nlunch.  And we finished reading the latest Captain Underpants book (I read, <br/>\nshe listened and commented non-stop as she does -- this is a book her big <br/>\nbrother just read and she wanted to have it read to her too because he was <br/>\nlaughing all the way thru it and it must be cool -- it was!).  We will take <br/>\none of her beginner reader (One Fish 2 Fish type) books with us at bb&#39;s <br/>\nlesson or color.<br/>\n<br/>\nEtc.  etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a fun age.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I did for a sanity check (and you may well not need this but I did) was <br/>\nto go to the local school&#39;s web page (the State Dept of Ed actually) and get <br/>\nthe Standards -- what they are supposed to be teaching the kids at each grade <br/>\nlevel.  It isn&#39;t much from what I could see but it gave me a sense that if we <br/>\njust do what comes naturally and follow up on things we like and use all the <br/>\ntools we like to use (books, computer, library, etc.) we will be just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, get her a library card!!  What power -- to be able to pick out your own <br/>\nbooks.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7096,"nextTopicId":7107}}
