If that&#39;s<br/>\nyou, please skip to the end.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Okay, I think I&#39;ve figured out how to express what bothers me. (I knew if I<br/>\n&gt; threw enough words at it I&#39;d figure it out ;-) It isn&#39;t Ned&#39;s *particular*<br/>\n&gt; political point of view that I&#39;d like to send elsewhere. It&#39;s having a<br/>\n&gt; *single* political point of view being expressed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s *very* interesting hearing a viewpoint that&#39;s so totally<br/>\n&gt; different from mine. If this were the debate folder in AOL&#39;s old<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling forum I&#39;d *love* to debate this. :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But we don&#39;t have a debate folder or any way of shuttling off a very large<br/>\n&gt; specialized discussion. The list is one great big messy it. And people<br/>\n&gt; signed up to discuss unschooling. Which means that if one person does want<br/>\n&gt; to express his political point of view if the rest of us go on discussing<br/>\n&gt; unschooling, that one person&#39;s view becomes the defacto political point of<br/>\n&gt; view of the list. I&#39;m not accusing Ned of doing that or wanting that. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; just how groups work. If no one disagrees, it appears everyone agrees.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful to unschoolers for Ned&#39;s to be the only political<br/>\n&gt; point of view expressed nor for it to appear he speaks for everyone. I think<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s far more valuable for there to be a diverse political point of view.<br/>\n&gt; Which means that since I strongly disagree with Ned that I, and anyone else<br/>\n&gt; who values more than one viewpoint being heard, need to point out where we<br/>\n&gt; disagree and why and discuss it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Political discussions being the way they are, they can&#39;t be handled in a few<br/>\n&gt; short posts. To offer a diverse -- or even just *one* other! -- political<br/>\n&gt; viewpoint the list would be taken over -- as it has for the past few days --<br/>\n&gt; by political discussion. And the people who discuss unschooling would be<br/>\n&gt; spending their energy in the political discussion. The overall quantity of<br/>\n&gt; emails would go up but the quality and quantity of unschooling discussion --<br/>\n&gt; which is what people signed up for -- would go down. (It&#39;s not a<br/>\n&gt; speculation. I&#39;ve seen it happen numerous times when one discussion<br/>\n&gt; overwhelms the list. People get shorter and fewer answers to their<br/>\n&gt; unschooling questions.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So the choices seem to be: 1) to have one political point of view expressed,<br/>\n&gt; 2) to have the list filled with political discussion or 3) to have no<br/>\n&gt; political points of view. (Or at least as close as can be achieved.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Suggesting Ned take the discussion somewhere else is like asking someone to<br/>\n&gt; take a very loud and overwhelming specialized discussion to another room so<br/>\n&gt; that those who came to *this* room to discuss unschooling can do so.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think Pam suggested NHEN&#39;s Legislative list.<br/>\n&gt; (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/NHEN-Legislative)\">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/NHEN-Legislative)</a>. There are also loads of<br/>\n&gt; other lists at Yahoo. And Ned could even start his own. (Or someone could<br/>\n&gt; start one and invite Ned to join :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Joyce<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ned responds: <br/>\nJoyce, in all your &quot;non-political&quot; postings, your own political views have<br/>\nbecome clearly visible. Just because you don&#39;t say what they are &quot;out loud&quot;<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t express them. They are at least as loud and<br/>\noverwhelming as mine, so why not come out of your presumed closet and be<br/>\ndone with it. It&#39;s the right thing to do.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40761,"nextTopicId":40751}}
