It&#39;s reassuring to hear there&#39;s a lot of other <br/>\nunschoolers here, since we haven&#39;t met any yet. (We&#39;ve been here in Ohio only <br/>\na couple of years.) I&#39;ve heard of HECLC, but I seem to hear about meetings <br/>\nafter they happen, instead of before. I thought I was on an e-mail list for <br/>\nthem, but I think I&#39;m trying to go in so many directions at once I can&#39;t seem <br/>\nto follow up anything completely. I&#39;ll keep the 23rd free! <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - what is the &quot;old Resource Center&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 1/4/03 11:56:18 AM Eastern Standard Time, &quot;Marjorie Kirk&quot; &lt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mkirk@...\">mkirk@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; As far as I know, there aren&#39;t any official unschooling groups in town, but<br/>\n&gt; there are a lot of unschoolers.  There also used to be a playgroup at the<br/>\n&gt; old Resource Center for families with young children, but i don&#39;t know if <br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; still in existance or not.  I would recommend attending a meeting or two to<br/>\n&gt; see who you could hook up with.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Marjorie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are you familiar with HECLC?  It&#39;s a group trying to start a  new Resource<br/>\n&gt; Center in Columbus.
