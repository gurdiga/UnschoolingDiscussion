Even if they&#39;re not the choices<br/>\nyou would make for them?  To me, that would be the biggest issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n** Hey, I love buts! LOL Yes, they can pick anything they want to eat, whenever they want to eat it, out of what&#39;s in my kitchen! However, I do sometimes say &quot;no&quot; to cooking two completely different meals for lunch. In that case, we usually compromise with one or two items each person wants, and they can finish up with whatever else is there if they&#39;re still hungry. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you set limits on how many organically grown dried apricots they can<br/>\nhave? <br/>\n<br/>\n** Only to say &quot;please see if your brother wants some before you eat them all&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n Can they eat the &quot;wrong&quot; foods for breakfast?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n** There&#39;s a wrong food for breakfast? &lt;g&gt; Pizza is my absolute favorite breakfast food! Yes, they can eat whatever for whatever meal they want. We all like to have &quot;breakfast&quot; for supper, especially pancakes! Yum, I&#39;m getting hungry now! Oh, and desert before a meal is pretty normal here too. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Is cereal at dinner<br/>\ninstead of spinach and brown rice casserole okay?  (This is one that always<br/>\nsends Tim to the kitchen in quest of a peanut butter sandwich!)<br/>\n<br/>\n** Yes! They&#39;re free to not eat whatever they don&#39;t want of what I fix, but usually since they got to pick at least one, if not all, of what I fixed, I don&#39;t have that problem. I&#39;m much more likely to be the one hunting something else to eat! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother never let us have snacks before dinner because it would ruin our<br/>\nappetites.  She also made us eat everything on our plate in order to have<br/>\ndessert.  It&#39;s true; when Tim has a pre-dinner snack, he doesn&#39;t finish<br/>\neverything.  So?  I still offer dessert.  I think he ate dessert once last<br/>\nweek.  I tend to eat it every day.  Who has the problem here?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n** I don&#39;t limit the number or time of snacks, I will tell them that lunch will be ready in 15 minutes or whatever so they&#39;ll know that food is coming, and choose more wisely whether or not or how much to snack, but it&#39;s still their choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t about big decisions; it&#39;s about the little stuff.  Children need<br/>\nthe freedom to make the little, daily choices, and as a result make the<br/>\noccasional error in judgement.  That&#39;s the point. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n** That&#39;s what I thought, too! I don&#39;t see how buying one type of chicken or another, or one type of candy or making candy really matters in the whole scope of things, as long as the things are available to be had. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Yahoo!
