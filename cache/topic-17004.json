The school system in the city we lived in were easy to \nwork with. We had problems with DSS instead. Also be wary of nosy neighbors. In \nsome states people can make anonymous calls and you have the burden of proving \nthem wrong. We had a therapist call DSS over something that had happened in \ntheir mothers house before we got custody but we still had to go through an \ninvestigation that took three months. Both our older children are labeled \n&quot;learning disabled&quot; by the public system. The older child they just modified her \nprogram by reading everything to her and assigning half of whatever her class \ndid. The result was when we started homeschooling  she had a first grade reading \nlevel! Extremely humiliating for a teenager. She has improved but is still a \nreluctant&nbsp;reader. I try to encourage her to read anything that interests \nher. I hope you continue to seek what is best for your child. Remember the \npublic school interest is the &quot;public good&quot;, not your childs. </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Johanna</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:staclarspr@...\"\n title=\"staclarspr@...\">staclarspr@...</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Wednesday, March 14, 2001 10:01 \n  PM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [Unschooling-dotcom] \n  new/all</div>\n  <div><br></div><font face=\"arial,helvetica\"><font face=\"Tahoma\" size=\"2\"\n FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\">Hello to everyone on the list, <br><br>I also have been a \n  lurker, starting homeschooling along with my daycare <br>business has kept me \n  busy. &nbsp; <br>My name is Linda S. and we live in ND. <br>I am finding the \n  information, and tips, wonderful information! <br>I recently took time off a \n  list I had been a member on for the past <br>4 years, (not a list for \n  homeschooling) to join this one, and its been <br>refreshing. <br><br>I am \n  interested in touching base with any of you who&#39;s child/children did \n  <br>attend public school, and than to HS, or also children that had learning \n  <br>difficulties in Public School. <br><br>Today I had a telephone conference \n  with the school to finalize my son&#39;s <br>transition from school to homeschool. \n  I was asked in the begining of this <br>meeting if I would consider sending my \n  11 year old son back to school, <br>or send him 1/2 a day. <br><br>This drove \n  me nuts, as I took on homeschooling my son with full <br>responsibility, \n  <br>not on a whim........ <br>Bottom line here is that I am so tired of the \n  school, and the damage that <br>they are capable of.

I was asked in the begining of this\n<br>meeting if I would consider sending my 11 year old son back to school,\n<br>or send him 1/2 a day. \n<br> \n<br>This drove me nuts, as I took on homeschooling my son with full \n<br>responsibility,\n<br>not on a whim........\n<br>Bottom line here is that I am so tired of the school, and the damage that\n<br>they are capable of. The anxiety it produces, makes me work even harder\n<br>and strengthens me belief&#39;s that I have made the right choice.\n<br>\n<br>Linda S.\n<br>Please inform me if there are any other Linda&#39;s on the list. So there won&#39;t\n<br>be any confusion.\n<br></font></font></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17013,"nextTopicId":17024}}
