I enjoy organizing--gives me a profound sense of <br/>\naccomplishment! Even if Pam S. did tell me I was a different species! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I look at clutter or mess as an opportunity, it allows me to think <br/>\nabout how our system is working for the whole family, whether our needs <br/>\nhave changed, which they do constantly with three small children. I want <br/>\nour home to work for  everyone in the family; I want everyone to love being <br/>\nhome. Reorganizing keeps me that much more in touch with how things are <br/>\nworking for everyone, and my binges are almost always preceded by a <br/>\ndiscussion with the kids or dh how things might work better or at least why <br/>\nthey&#39;re not working. We call it &quot;futzing,&quot; as in &quot;Mama&#39;s futzing again.&quot; &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I think of giving my children &quot;responsibility,&quot; it&#39;s more like <br/>\n&quot;control.&quot; I am a big fan of lots of clear plastic bins and lots of low <br/>\nshelves, of which I never have enough. This lets the kids see what they <br/>\nwant and get at it; also makes things easier to put away.<br/>\nI have everything within their reach and perspective, which allows them to <br/>\ntake control over the things they want. All the toys they play with on a <br/>\nregular basis are within their reach, as is the tv, vcr tapes, their <br/>\ncomputer and games, their snacks and food.  The only limitation is low <br/>\nshelving space! &lt;LOL&gt; I try to put really obvious stuff high up, so they <br/>\ncan clearly see it and ask for it when they want it. Not so much <br/>\n&quot;responsibility&quot; as control over their world, which I think is tremendously <br/>\nimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleaning has always worked best as a group effort in our house. When we all <br/>\ndo it happily, the kids almost always pitch in happily. When we try to get <br/>\nthem to do it themselves, it often turns into a battle. Dh has been slow to <br/>\nget this, as he still gets caught up in the traditional &quot;responsibility&quot; <br/>\nmode (we&#39;re working on this, and he&#39;s trying hard, but sometimes it&#39;s <br/>\nknee-jerk). When I want things picked up, it&#39;s usually because I want to <br/>\nrun a vacuum. I just tell them that I&#39;d like to vacuum and could they <br/>\nplease help me pick things up off the floor. This is usually plenty of <br/>\nmotivation--small things have gone the way of the vacuum in the past. The <br/>\nfamily room we do probably every other day, but the bedrooms only about <br/>\nonce a week. This seems to work for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelping is voluntary and still fun for them, and I hope it always stays <br/>\nthis way. Sam (3.5) helped his dad bring wood around for the wood stove <br/>\nyesterday. Emily (6) picked up a couple of hand fulls of kindling because <br/>\nshe wanted to be helpful, and yesterday, she helped her brother make his <br/>\nbed. Julia (5) loves to be helpful and take care of other people--she&#39;s the <br/>\nfirst one to run and get ice or a special blanket if someone gets hurt or <br/>\nsad.

I said &quot;No, most people might not. It&#39;s more like I suggest it because that&#39;s where my mother insisted I keep MY socks when I was a kid. I have a separate drawer now for my socks. So, as long as they&#39;re in your dresser, just put them where you want them.&quot; She went off, and as far as I know that&#39;s where she put them...somewhere in her dresser.

It may help the organizer to find things more easily, but someone else may have organized it a different way, and may not see any rhyme or reason to the &#39;organization&#39;.  If one person says,&quot;That&#39;s where it goes&quot;, another might ask, &quot;Why?&quot;, and the response to the why? should be a careful one.  Just because I like to keep the scissors in the junk drawer in the kitchen doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s where they should go.  Someone else may use them in an entirely different part of the house more often than I use them, so maybe their placement of the scissors makes more sense than mine.  At least to them it does.  You can force a person to put things away in a certain place, but you cannot force a person to be &#39;organized&#39;.  Some people are, some aren&#39;t, and it&#39;s usually the organized people that are doing the bitching.  Sometimes the organized people can even make the rest of us feel guilty about our un-organization, and make us feel inept and defic<br/>\n ient if we are unable to &#39;pull ourselves up&#39; to their level.  If organized people want to go around organizing things, fine, but just leave the rest of us alone.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~~And I&#39;ve noticed that when I&#39;m searching for something I don&#39;t appreciate<br/>\nsomeone telling me that I should have put them where they belonged!~~<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm...that sounds like a payback to me, lol.  I doubt anyone appreciates having their own &#39;lectures&#39; handed back to them.  But it is a great way to find out how the lecture really &#39;feels&#39; to others.  (I speak from experience, I used to be King of the Cleaning Lectures.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone should be able to decide what is &#39;clean enough&#39; for themselves.  If someone doesn&#39;t like the way I did something, then they can re-do it to their heart&#39;s content!  If it wasn&#39;t good enough, then fix it yourself!<br/>\n<br/>\nKids have way too much going on to worry about soemthing as mundane as cleaning.  A person is only a kid for a short time, let them enjoy it, because they will have the rest of their lives to feel the &#39;burden&#39; of things like cleaning, just like we all do now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLyle<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Always remember, Lead By Example***<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n___________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign-up for Ads Free at Mail.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://promo.mail.com/adsfreejump.htm\">http://promo.mail.com/adsfreejump.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164542605,"authorName":"Danielle E.

We grabbed our cuisinaire rods and used them to represent visually <br/>\nthe comparisons that were being made. Then I pulled up excel, and we <br/>\nfigured out the daily expenditure for our household and compared it to the <br/>\nworld average this website was giving through the cuisinaire rods. Very <br/>\nsobering.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, my kids asked for money, so we figured out with a pie chart what <br/>\npercentage of our household income goes where. I showed them that whatever <br/>\ngets leftover is what we get to spend. We made up envelopes with pictures <br/>\non the front representing each budget category--mortgage, car, groceries, <br/>\nclasses, savings, utilities, etc. Now, they get $40 every month as income; <br/>\nthey then divvy the appropriate percentage out to each &quot;bill,&quot; and whatever <br/>\nis left over is their&#39;s to spend, save, whatever. Their income is tied only <br/>\nto the household income and expenditures, just like mine and dh&#39;s. This has <br/>\nbeen helpful for me as well as the kids. It helps us all keep our budget in <br/>\nmind and our spending on track. The kids understand in concrete ways where <br/>\nthe money comes from, where it goes, and why.<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] RE: Cleaning","postDate":"1072616624","msgId":86963,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJDMTQzRUUwLjIyNTNFJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwN2EwMWMzY2NhZCQ2Mjk3N2YxMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBuZXc+"},"prevInTopic":86951,"nextInTopic":86965,"prevInTime":86962,"nextInTime":86964,"topicId":38484,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The parent may set lower standards for a child but the standards<br/>\nare still the parent&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue responsibility means you are able to weigh the consequences of the<br/>\noptions open to you and choose what works best for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Then just recently I started an<br/>\n&gt; allowance. He needs to help out in order to earn his money.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are pitfalls of tying allowance to performance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like good training for the business world. But unlike a real job<br/>\nwhere someone has choices about what type of work to do and the atmosphere<br/>\nthey like to work in, the work available at home is limited to what the<br/>\nparent is willing to pay for. That&#39;s fine and resembles the working world if<br/>\nthe child wants to earn extra money. But as a sole source of income it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t resemble real life at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t ask<br/>\n&gt; him for much, an occasional throw out the trash or clean up your area.

Not even a little bit. If we&#39;re requesting, it should be the type<br/>\nof request we&#39;d make of an adult. We should recognize that we&#39;re imposing on<br/>\nsomeone to help us out and asking them to do us a favor. And we should be<br/>\naware that we owe them something in return, such as a sincere thank you and<br/>\nappreciation at the very least.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; know that might be harsh, but really he doesn&#39;t need it, its more of an<br/>\n&gt; incentive.

But<br/>\nwhen there are exacting requirements from the asker and disappointment at<br/>\nthe job done then it doesn&#39;t encourage someone to volunteer to help out that<br/>\nperson.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it helps us approach it with the right attitude that will encourage<br/>\nhelp if we look at our kids help as doing us a favor, not conscripted labor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just tell him that if he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; it that way, they will always be where he can find them.

We&#39;re usually more motivated to expend energy to find<br/>\nsomething than we are to expend energy to put it away.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrganzing does, of course, help make finding easier! But I did see that<br/>\nbefore puberty that my daughter would find organizing overwhelming.

If a person appears grumpy about cleaning, the kids will pick up on that and immediately assume that cleaning is a real bummer.  If you hear yourself complaining about something needing cleaned, everyone else hears the complaining too.  If YOU obviously don&#39;t want to do it, there&#39;s a good chance that your kids won&#39;t be overly excited about it either.  Complaining leaves a bad vibe in the air--not a good selling point.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a parent makes something sound like a really big deal, it becomes even bigger in a child&#39;s mind.  If it&#39;s a big, negative deal, it may become even more negative for a kid.  A positive attitude sets a much more pleasant stage for others to walk out on.  Set the example you would like others to follow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is definitely a transition period after a proclamation like &quot;NO MORE CHORES&quot; is given.  For a kid it may be like being set free from prison, and for awhile they may want to push their newfound freedom to the limit.  But slowly, cleaning and picking up will be no big deal, as long as the parents are not making it a big deal.  My kids do a lot more picking up now than they did a couple of years ago, and there are more and more days when I get home and the dishes have been ran, the counters are wiped down, and the house is almost....clean.  Not everyday, but there are days when I don&#39;t want to do it either.  And some days I don&#39;t.  The kids have that same right.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlan on doing most of the cleaning for awhile.  Better yet, plan on doing ALL of the cleaning for awhile, and whenever someone else pitches in, you may appreciate it more.  Try not to look at it as &quot;I have to do it all!&quot;, because you don&#39;t have to do it all.  There&#39;s always a choice.  If you don&#39;t feel like cleaning today, then don&#39;t.  Will the house get messier?  Yup.  Is it a big deal?  Shouldn&#39;t be.  During de-choring your house is going to be messier.  It&#39;s a fact.  But little by little things will change, and you will notice things getting done that you didn&#39;t have to do and didn&#39;t have to demand done.  It won&#39;t happen overnight.  It probably won&#39;t happen in three months.  It may not happen in the first year if a parent walks in day after day, exasperated with the fact that a room isn&#39;t clean and tidy.  When you say to your kids, &quot;hey, why didn&#39;t you clean that up?&quot;, the first thing that may go through their minds is, &quot;well why didn&#39;t you?&quot;  It works both ways.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCleaning doesn&#39;t have to be a big deal.  Don&#39;t make it a big deal and your kids may be more inclined to follow in your footsteps.<br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ivorygrace7@...\">ivorygrace7@...</a><br/>\nDate: Sat, 27 Dec 2003 13:11:03 EST<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Cleaning<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if I have any answers, but I also would like more info on <br/>\n&gt; &quot;dechoring&quot; from people who have been there.
