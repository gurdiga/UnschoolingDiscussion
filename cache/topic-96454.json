Many of the tags have political <br/>\nconnotations.  I love search for graffiti of turtles -- sometimes <br/>\naccompanied by the word &quot;turdle&quot; -- indicating buildings and areas <br/>\nwhere the artist feels that the City of Detroit is &quot;slow to change&quot;.  <br/>\nBuildings needing demolition, crappy roads or city services, etc.  <br/>\nAnother more well known local artist tags abandoned buildings and burnt <br/>\nout homes with a very large pink dot to make it known to city officials <br/>\nthat THIS needs to go.  There are others in the area too and if you <br/>\ndrive around the city often you begin to recognize different tagger&#39;s <br/>\ncalling cards.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Australia there is a group called BUGA-UP - Billboard Using Graffitists<br/>\nAgainst Unhealthy Promotions. They use often humorous and very clever<br/>\ngraffiti on billboards advertising cigarettes and alcohol mostly - sometimes<br/>\npointing out falsehoods inherent in the visuals, like yellowing the model&#39;s<br/>\nteeth.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
