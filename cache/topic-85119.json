I never sent my child away; I was normally right there <br/>\nin the room. Very quickly I learned that having him control his <br/>\nactual time worked much better than a set time. I said to him....&quot;get <br/>\nup when you think you can act, sound, or feel better.&quot; I wanted him <br/>\nto never dread his room or the place where he chose to have a time <br/>\nout. I felt that time out was good for him because we used the time <br/>\nfor his comfort as well as my anger. (When he was little, I probably <br/>\nterrified him. But he never seemed scared, just mad at everything.)  <br/>\nWhen he got older, he went to his room on his own. I never tried to <br/>\nrestrict what he did there and he would stay for quite a while <br/>\nsometimes just thinking and playing. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere along the line after he heard himself and I think because <br/>\nhe was just growing up too, he started apologizing. Maybe it was <br/>\nbecause I would apologize to him for not being able to deal with his <br/>\ntone. At that time, time outs just kinda stopped and even though he <br/>\nstill got nasty sounding, I wasn&#39;t so mad.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;time in&quot; books sounds like a nessesary read for me. I&#39;ve a <br/>\ngrandson just born and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get him sooner than I think. <br/>\n(They are overseas right now.) Does or has anyone else used time outs <br/>\nand how have they evolved for you?
