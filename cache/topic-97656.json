Here it is:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;(Having attended the last two unschooling conferences in Columbia, SC), <br/>\n&gt;probably the best reason for attending is not on the list of 11 really <br/>\n&gt;cool things:  That is the sense of being part of and connecting with a <br/>\n&gt;community of folks who are doing the very same thing you&#39;re doing or are <br/>\n&gt;trying to do, a community of folks who understand and encourage you and <br/>\n&gt;your kids to be who you are.  It was a great experience for Liam and me to <br/>\n&gt;see so many other families being respectful towards and joyful with their <br/>\n&gt;children and it was great to feel &quot;normal&quot; instead of &quot;out there&quot; with <br/>\n&gt;300-plus other families.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Money and scheduling are going to prevent us from being able to go this <br/>\n&gt;year, but if there&#39;s any chance you can possibly go, I strongly and <br/>\n&gt;emphatically endorse this conference, **especially** if you have a spouse <br/>\n&gt;who needs a fuller understanding of what you&#39;re doing and why!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s all I know.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gaiawolf.org/\">http://www.gaiawolf.org/</a>&gt;GaiaWolf ~ Music for the Planet<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The animals of this world exist for their own reasons.
