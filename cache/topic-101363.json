(My son, also 9, likes to let out the lions!)   <br/>\nWe borrowed the Expanded version from our library -- I think it&#39;s <br/>\ncalled the &quot;Complete Collection&quot; with Dinosaur and Marine Mania <br/>\nexpansion packs.  You can let the dinosaurs out to eat the visitors <br/>\nin the expanded version. There are some competing opinions at Amazon -<br/>\n- and from people who have played both, so it&#39;s a pretty good <br/>\nresource.  If the links below don&#39;t work, just go to Amazon.com and <br/>\ntype in &quot;Zoo Tycoon.&quot;  You&#39;ll get the links to these pages.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\nLink to Zoo Tycoon Complete Collection review at Amazon (cut and <br/>\npaste):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-</a><br/>\n/B0000A2TPE/qid=1102047684/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-1209212-3409439?<br/>\nv=glance&s=videogames&n=507846<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLink to Zoo Tycoon 2 review at Amazon (cut and paste):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-</a><br/>\n/B000300HK0/qid=1102047684/sr=8-2/ref=pd_csp_2/103-1209212-3409439?<br/>\nv=glance&s=software&n=507846</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"zoo tycoon 1 or 2?","postDate":"1101244792","msgId":101363,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNGQwMWM0ZDFhMiQyZTJhNTU5MCQ2NTAxYThjMEBob21lPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQxMTIzLjA5NDYwNy4yMzIwLjAuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+IDw0MUEzNzJFRC4yMDMwMzA2QGxpYmVyby5pdD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":101473,"prevInTime":101362,"nextInTime":101364,"topicId":101363,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Jackie (9) has been playing a demo version of zoo tycoon.
