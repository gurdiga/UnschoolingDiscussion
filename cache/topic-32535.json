They often yell out &quot;MOOOooom,  he&#39;s doing such and such to me&quot; or at each other &quot;I said GET OUT!&quot; (of my room) or the never ending array of names they call each other when one does something to upset the other.

Once it will be Ben causing the trouble, picking on Jonathan, and next it will be the other way around.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried ignoring or staying out of their fights, to some degree, and often that leads to the physical fights.<br/>\nI have tried time-outs/sending them to their own rooms to settle down for a while.<br/>\nI have tried taking away privileges, in several different manners. - For the one who started the fight.

It may work for one or two times after, but the root problem is still always there, and a fight is literally always seconds away from developing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just go minute by minute, day by day, to get through the fighting.
