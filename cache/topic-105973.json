Life is just so<br/>\ngood here in our little world.  We are an introverted family.  My girls are<br/>\nnow 8 and 10.  It wasn&#39;t so many years ago when I decided not to send my<br/>\noldest to school that I was hearing concerns from other people (however<br/>\ngently) about how if I didn&#39;t send them to school or somewhere with a lot of<br/>\nchildren regularly that they wouldn&#39;t be properly socialized. Some people<br/>\nworried about their natural reserved nature. They were pained to be the<br/>\ncenter of attention, especially my older dd. They felt put on the spot if<br/>\nsomeone spoke to them.  (other than people they were close to)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt has just been so cool to watch them come into their own.  I&#39;ve let them<br/>\ndevelop socially at their own pace, and have not pushed them beyond their<br/>\ncomfort level.  I often spoke for them when they couldn&#39;t bring themselves<br/>\nto answer someone and despite the fact that I would have loved to brag about<br/>\nthem over the years, they never felt comfortable with me sharing their<br/>\nsuccesses, so I kept quiet.  They felt put of stage if I bragged about<br/>\nanything they did.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBut now they are both comfortable in their own skin.  They are confident in<br/>\nwho they are and what they know.  They like who they are and their<br/>\nconfidence in relating to others and being the center of attention continues<br/>\nto grow.  They do things for the intrinsic value it brings them, not to<br/>\nimpress others.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThey were both recently in a horse show, a dressage show actually, where<br/>\nthey ride alone in front of a judge, riding in a pattern. (with an audience<br/>\ntoo) They were confident and calm.  I was nervous and over excited.  They<br/>\nwent in, rode their pattern, stopped in front of the judge like they were<br/>\nsupposed to, and came out with huge smiles, feeling rewarded for having<br/>\ncompeted.  The ribbons they won were frosting on the cake, but not the<br/>\nreason for competing at all.  It was so cool!  It would have been so hard to<br/>\nimagine 5 years ago.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne neighbor who was particularly concerned about my children&#39;s reserved<br/>\nnature when they were younger came and watched.  She was in awe of their<br/>\nconfidence and calm.  Despite my worries sometimes, I just knew deep inside<br/>\nme that they needed to develop socially on their own schedule.  It has been<br/>\nso cool to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLike Kirby, my girls are confident in their own skin, in their minds, and in<br/>\ntheir beings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey aren&#39;t afraid of their parents and they go to sleep happy and wake up<br/>\nglad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey have a zest for life and learning that is immeasurable.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is grand!<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] priorities (thanks, Schuyler)","postDate":"1116424285","msgId":105979,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFmNS45Zjk4NTMzLjJmYmNhMjVkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":105977,"nextInTopic":105988,"prevInTime":105978,"nextInTime":105980,"topicId":105973,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/18/2005 8:28:21 AM Central Standard Time, SandraDodd@aol.com writes: Here he  is in a suit ~~~ That s better!  lol.

Marty and  I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Cottonwood.  Michelle got free tickets.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Oh, right.  I remember you told me that.  If Cameron calls I&#39;ll  tell him <br/>\nyou&#39;re unavailable to assist him.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Okay, thanks.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nSo he went to bed, and I came to sit and drink tea.<br/>\n <br/>\nI KNOW that whole conversation could have gone differently.  I could  have <br/>\nbeen grouchy that he was still up at nearly 5:00 a.m.  Some moms  might&#39;ve been <br/>\nuncomfortable (or worse) at an 18 year old appearing in his  underwear with no <br/>\nself consciousness.  He didn&#39;t ask to go to the movies  (though he did tell <br/>\nme weeks ago).<br/>\n <br/>\nMy priority is to help him live at peace in his own home, and letting him  <br/>\nknow that I care about him and his comfort is part of that.<br/>\n <br/>\nCameron is younger than Kirby and often tags along.  He got a job two  days <br/>\nago and is feeling older and bigger, and has recently started to  drive.<br/>\n <br/>\nMichelle is in her 20&#39;s and Kirby knows her from the Anime club.  Her  <br/>\nboyfriend works early and doesn&#39;t want to go to a midnight showing of Star Wars,  so <br/>\nshe&#39;s taking Kirby with the complimentary tickets she got working at Suncoast <br/>\n Video.<br/>\n <br/>\nKirby was out late at a friend&#39;s house helping him prepare for an L5R  <br/>\ntournament he&#39;s running this coming weekend.  The friend is 30 or older,  has a wife <br/>\nand two children, very organized and responsible, and his assistant  of <br/>\nchoice was Kirby.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd about that reading...  Kirby was reading aloud the other night  from a <br/>\ngaming manual to that big batch of guys who went to see Pirates of  Penzance <br/>\nwith us.  Kirby and Marty really wanted to go to the play.   As things turned <br/>\nout, three unexpected others went with us.  That was  fine. They went because <br/>\nthey were involved in a role playing game, and wanted to  continue it later, and <br/>\nbecause they trust Kirby and Marty&#39;s judgement about  what&#39;s cool.  They had <br/>\nfun, and came back and played several hours longer  afterward.   But Kirby, one <br/>\nof the youngest of the seven there,  and one of the &quot;least educated,&quot; was <br/>\nreading difficult material aloud to  attentive others, one of whom (Leif, who&#39;s <br/>\ncamped in the Star Wars  line) has a college degree, one of whom has two years <br/>\nof college, and none  of whom had any reason to say, &quot;Let me read that.&quot;   He <br/>\ncould&#39;ve been  reading it for taping, or radio.  Expressive, clear, no <br/>\nhesitation.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe&#39;s confident in his skin, in his mind, and in his being.<br/>\nHe&#39;s not afraid of his parents.<br/>\nHe goes to sleep happy and he wakes up glad.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy priorities could have been different.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105948,"nextTopicId":105999}}
