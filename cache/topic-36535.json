At very young ages, they<br/>\nmade decisions BETTER than most adults I know.  They eat ice cream very<br/>\nrarely, although it&#39;s always there.  They eat cookies and cake hardly at<br/>\nall.<br/>\nDonuts dry up.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout three/four months ago, I did what AnneO,Sandra, Ren and Joyce (and<br/>\nothers) suggested and i began trusting my children to eat according to their<br/>\nbodies needs, even the two year old. I began &quot;undieting&quot; (not diet to lose<br/>\nweight, diet as in what people eat) Once my children had their fill of the<br/>\nsweeter stuff, once they trusted Me to not decide for them, they started<br/>\nchoosing healthy.<br/>\nYesterday Emily had a choice of Pop-tarts, vegetable soup, grapes, milk,<br/>\npretzles, lemon drops, girl scout cookies, salad. For lunch she had<br/>\nVegetable soup. Later she had ice cream. For breakfast I think she ate<br/>\nyogurt she grabbed from the fridge and a granola bar.<br/>\nI think she had another soup for dinner but I don&#39;t remember. Max also makes<br/>\nhis own choices although I tend to &quot;strew&quot; foods with larger quantities of<br/>\nvitamins minerals, antioxidents, fiber since he doesn&#39;t wuite understand the<br/>\nintricacies of healthy eating. They are healthy, growing, happy children.<br/>\nIt took a few months for us to &quot;de-diet&quot; but it really worked. Try it for a<br/>\nfew months (who ever is reading this) you may be surprised. I seriously<br/>\ndoubt that in todays food industry, a child who&#39;s parent provides free reign<br/>\nto food that includes all kinds of choices will become nutritionally<br/>\ndeficient. Even Spiderman Pop-Tarts are fortified.<br/>\n~Elissa Cleaveland<br/>\n&quot;It is nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction<br/>\nhave<br/>\nnot yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry.&quot; A.
