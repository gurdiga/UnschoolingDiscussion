If you all <br/>\nremember, I didn&#39;t know whether or not ds should dress for it.  Well, we took <br/>\nthe complete costume and when we got there, ds wanted nothing to do with it. <br/>\nLOL Once during the duelist shows, he wanted it on so we went to the truck <br/>\nand put it on him.  They let us come in with the sword without a problem.  Ds <br/>\ngot up on the stage after the guys finished and had a duel with one of them.  <br/>\nLuckily, he wanted it off right after and dh took it back to the truck, cause <br/>\nit started pouring down rain.  We were all soaked and ds fell in the mud.  <br/>\nAll in all, we had a great time, but it was way too expensive to go twice.  I <br/>\nwanted to share some pictures of my little knight with you all.  They were <br/>\ntaken just recently and not at the festival or I would have shared them <br/>\nsooner.  I hope you enjoy them and thanks again for your help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nicholasacademy.homestead.com/pictures.html\">http://nicholasacademy.homestead.com/pictures.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCheryl<br/>\nNicholas Academy Homeschooling Resources<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nicholasacademy.homestead.com\">http://nicholasacademy.homestead.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14226,"nextTopicId":14225}}
