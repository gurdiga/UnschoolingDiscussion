I think it might be helpful for her to understand that taking a <br/>\ntest is NOT wrong. Kids do it all the time. They do it in school every day. <br/>\nIt&#39;s okay that she took a test with grandma. Assure her that you&#39;re not <br/>\nworried that she took it, that she might have failed it, that it might have <br/>\nharmed her, etc. It&#39;s just a test. Then further explain to her that you <br/>\nthink tests are meaningless, innaccurate and unecessary and THAT is why you <br/>\nhave never done tests with her. Tell her that grandma simply did a dumb <br/>\nthing and wasted her time to try to prove something to you about education <br/>\nand schools. YOU are completely aware of of smart and amazing and educated <br/>\nyour daughter is. Grandma is the one who needs the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s my second opinion. I think you should take Grandma out for lunch and <br/>\nthen have a psychologist come over to give her some IQ/Psycological profile <br/>\ntesting.

He figured that the problem was <br/>\nway more than the unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s another perspective on the husband not being as alarmed about <br/>\nhis mother as you are.  He was raised by her and is used to her <br/>\nways.  She&#39;s not normal to objective observers but for him it&#39;s the <br/>\nnorm for her.  I have a MIL who&#39;s the almost the exact opposite of <br/>\nme.  When she does or says something that gets on my nerves, my <br/>\nhusband doesn&#39;t get as upset as I do.  He tells me to ignore her and <br/>\nkeep on doing what I&#39;m doing.  It works.  Fortunately we do not live <br/>\nclose to each other, so I don&#39;t have to think about her everyday.  My <br/>\nhusband also told me that sons see meddling mothers as loving and/or <br/>\ncaring.  I think this is especially true of mothers who were <br/>\nphysically and emotionally distant (my husband&#39;s mother is).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I was in your situation I would talk to her directly.  The husband <br/>\nis (most likely) going to be gentle and a little appeasing.  She&#39;ll <br/>\nstill have hope in her heart that she can get her way with your kids <br/>\nand your husband.  I&#39;d make it clear to her why she wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nseeing the kids alone anymore.  It doesn&#39;t have to be a loud fight <br/>\njust direct and uncompromising on your part.  I&#39;d also offer her some <br/>\ninfo on unschooling if you already haven&#39;t, maybe help her see that <br/>\nyou aren&#39;t following some vague whim.<br/>\n<br/>\nCherry in GA<br/>\n<br/>\nPS-My MIL went through a phase about the time my son turned 2 1/2 <br/>\nabout toilet-training.
