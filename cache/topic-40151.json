I <br/>\nnever<br/>\nfeel like I quite fit in with anyone&#39;s crowd. I&#39;m further different <br/>\nfrom<br/>\nmost because I also homeschool and even UNschool, do not vaccinate, <br/>\nhad a<br/>\nhomebirth, and also try to practice natural medicine when at all <br/>\npossible.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading this (I knew these about you before, but it was good to <br/>\nbe reminded) I got all excited about meeting you at the conference <br/>\nagain!!<br/>\nIt is tiring to believe SO deeply in something and always have people <br/>\nquestion you as though you were nuts.<br/>\nI have exactly ONE friend at work that is accepting of my lifestyle. <br/>\nThe rest of them I&#39;m friendly with, but they think I&#39;m nuts.....<br/>\nI have no desire to fit in with the sheep though.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are still coming to the SC conference Karin? I really, really <br/>\nhope so...we have so much in common.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra was saying recently how it must be kinda nice to just believe <br/>\nin the status quo and feel comfortable in yhour life rather than <br/>\nquestioning everything. I have also thought this.....dh and I talked <br/>\nabout it the other day.<br/>\nHow you could just be content with things the way they are, trust the <br/>\ngovernment, your preacher/religion and not always feel the need to <br/>\nswim upstream. I said it might feel nice to be like that, but in the <br/>\nend I wouldn&#39;t want to live a lie. And that&#39;s what it&#39;d be to me. A <br/>\nbig, fat LIE. I&#39;ll take the road less traveled anytime.<br/>\nJoy and satisfaction have been found there, along with the inability <br/>\nto be content with the status quo.<br/>\nOnward fellow revolutionists!!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40140,"nextTopicId":40171}}
