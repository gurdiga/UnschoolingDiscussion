Life is so busy here, though, it&#39;s almost more than I can do to just read all the posts, much less respond.  So I wanted to say thank you to everyone.  The lightbulb above my head is glowing brighter these days, and I&#39;m having many success and happy moments at home because of what I&#39;m learning here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo even though we have been having financial difficulties for at least 2 years and my car has been broken for 3 weeks and I&#39;m on my period  and out of pads and yesterday my 3 year old punctured her knee deeply on a rusty nail outside and I had to take the last running bus at 5:30 to the hospital ER 15 miles away for a tetanus shot, hoping that we&#39;d be able to find a way home that didn&#39;t mind taking a check since I had no cash (how nice that someone from the hospital gave us a ride home!), I&#39;m not a screaming lunatic and we are all feeling more secure and happier as a family.  Really.  Thanks so much for all the insight.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Andrea<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95136,"nextTopicId":95111}}
