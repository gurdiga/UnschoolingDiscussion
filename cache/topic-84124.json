Like cake vs. carrots at dinner<br/>\nor games vs. TV for recreation.  I never limited anything to make something<br/>\nelse look better. &quot;If you don&#39;t eat those carrots, you can&#39;t have the cake.&quot;<br/>\nIn fact, when they were very small and noticed that I was making something<br/>\nyummy and got excited, I&#39;d put it right on their plate with the meat and<br/>\npotatoes.  Sometimes they would eat the cake first and then the meat.  I<br/>\nwanted them to see/understand that sometimes you want to eat cake and<br/>\nsometimes you want the steak.  Sometimes you want to read a book and<br/>\nsometimes you want to watch TV.  Sometimes you want to ride your bike and<br/>\nsometimes you want to stay in and color.  Neither choice is neccessarily<br/>\n&quot;bad&quot; and your particular behavior doesn&#39;t make one thing better than<br/>\nanother.  My husband has stories of falling asleep at the table because he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t finish his dinner and couldn&#39;t get down until he had done so.  His<br/>\nmom tries to withhold dessert from our kids if they don&#39;t &quot;clean their<br/>\nplate.&quot;  I always override and &quot;spoil&quot; the kids!

It isn&#39;t the first time it happened either.  I was so tired after dinner that *I* suggested we watch a movie.  (Usually it is someone else suggesting that.)  My 8 year old said please can&#39;t we play a game instead!  This is a child who can watch TV whenever she wishes.  When the entire family is home, she is much more likely to vote for playing a game than watching TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we played yahtzee.  When one child got a yahtzee, the other joined her in dancing for joy.  Everyone was cheering when someone had a good turn and saying &quot;oh too bad&quot; but in a nice way when the roles weren&#39;t so great.  And I won!  I can&#39;t remember the last time I won at Yahtzee.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83925,"nextTopicId":83982}}
