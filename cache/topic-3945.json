Your story is very <br/>\ninteresting and I agree strongly with your message.  I don&#39;t know if my dad <br/>\nhas reached a level of confidence yet where he values himself for who he is <br/>\ncompletely but I would like to print up your essay and have him read it.<br/>\n     One side thing I thought about while reading this: with a passion for <br/>\nGerman Literature, you must have read Goethe.  I am just starting to read <br/>\nhim, having read some of his quotes in other books.  Are there any of his <br/>\nwritings that you would recommend in particular?  I am totally new to it.  <br/>\nThe book I bought is Goethe The Collected Works Volume 4,  From My Life  <br/>\nPoetry and Truth (Parts One to Three).  I know I will probably lose some of <br/>\nthe flavor of it reading it in English but I&#39;m afraid my German is limited to <br/>\nthings like, &quot;How much does that cost?&quot; and &quot;Where is the bathroom?&quot; from the <br/>\nthree years we lived in Germany.  <br/>\n     As always, thanks for sharing your thoughts...<br/>\n<br/>\n      Lucy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3938,"nextTopicId":3950}}
