What <br/>\na wonderful way to really get to know one another. <br/>\n<br/>\nAdmittedly, I began with much more of a schedule and, as my <br/>\nconfidence has grown, I&#39;ve abandoned much of our scheduled mornings. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my dilema I&#39;d love some feedback on:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile we hope to continue down this unschooling road, there&#39;s a <br/>\npossbility that our daugther may have to go to public school in the <br/>\nnext year or so due to finances (I would go back to work.). We hope <br/>\nthat&#39;s not the case but it&#39;s always in the back of my mind as my <br/>\ndaughter and I sit or hours knitting or reading or just hanging <br/>\nout.  I feel compelled to do some 5th grade math, keep up with some <br/>\nhistory, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are alternatives to us sending our daughter to school <br/>\nbut I would like to hear from others who may have had to make that <br/>\ndecision at some point and how you worked it out?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do others balance this if public school looms in the background?<br/>\nOur daughter has expressed some angst over the possibility of <br/>\nbeing &quot;way behind&quot; should she go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts would be very appreciated.<br/>\nDorothy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110956,"nextTopicId":110958}}
