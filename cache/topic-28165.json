But you see, it is not exactly just doing the<br/>\ndishes.  It is finding the dishes whereever they have been laid down, taking<br/>\nthem to the kitchen, and then doing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy real desire, of course, would be for the kids (and husband if we are<br/>\nbeing honest here), to take the dishes to the kitchen and put them in the<br/>\ndishwasher.  It is especially bad when part of the family is home, and I am<br/>\noff driving to various activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  Yesterday my daughter had play practice (45  minute drive each<br/>\nway) and we had to return videos, library books, take clothes to thrift<br/>\nstore, etc.  We got home at 5:00, and needed to leave at 5:30 to go to<br/>\nAWANA, another 35 minute drive each way in the other direction.  (We live in<br/>\nthe middle of nowhere).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point here is, I am tired at this time!  And I walk into a hourse with<br/>\ndirty dishes everywhere, food left out, wrappers, etc. on the counter.  This<br/>\nall done by the two which were home (husband and son).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy desire would to be to come home to a house where someone has realized I<br/>\nhave been running all day and would have taken the responsibility to clean<br/>\nup after themselves.  My question is, how do I get there without making it a<br/>\nrequirement?  I really don&#39;t want to make it a requirement.  I want them to<br/>\nsee that they are leaving a mess and want to clean it up, or at least clean<br/>\nsome of it up because they know it bothers me, or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I did do was the dishes.  And I don&#39;t know if that is the problem.<br/>\nThey expect that I will come home and do them.

We usually watch them on Nick Jr., <br/>\nor Noggin. They are popular with my preschooler, and have no <br/>\ncommercials during the program. Just piled up in between programs. If <br/>\nyou don&#39;t have those available, the library, or rental might have them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe like <br/>\n<br/>\n(from Nick Jr.)<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Dora the Explorer- girl hero uses spanish and english, simple maps, <br/>\ngoes on mini qeusts to help solve problems with friends. Lots of <br/>\nthinking, gentle puzzles, and viewer participation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Blues Clues- Steve (&quot;not the sharpest knife in the drawer&quot;) follows <br/>\nclues left by his girl puppy Blue to find out what Blue wants to do <br/>\ntoday. Also lots of thinking, gentle puzzles and viewer participation.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Little Bear- very imaginative simple tales of Little Bear and his <br/>\nfriends. Warm and fuzzy, yet not dull or syrupy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are others on Nick Jr. or Nogin that you might like.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Disney Channel my kids like Rolie Polie Olie, PB&J Otter, and some <br/>\npeople like Bear in the Big Blue House. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(Not on cable/dish tv. probably only rent or library)-<br/>\n<br/>\n1.Veggie Tales- Depending on your beliefs about religion and <br/>\nindoctrination, you may or may not like this series. It is true to <br/>\nitself as a Christian cartoon series. I am not Christian so I have <br/>\nmixed feelings about the series. We enjoy the humor, the songs, and the <br/>\ncomputer animation. Sometimes we will take what we like from it, and <br/>\nleave the rest. Other times it annoys me with it&#39;s presentation of <br/>\nreligion as fact, or as the only reason for moral behavior. They talk <br/>\nabout the Christian God, sometimes in a story from the Christian Bible, <br/>\nor just at the end as a quote from same. The lessons don&#39;t come across <br/>\nheavy, but they can be something to talk about with themes of <br/>\nforgiveness, thankfulness, generosity, etc., and discussions of your <br/>\nown religious beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. &quot;There Goes a Truck&quot;, or a plane or space shuttle, etc. These aren&#39;t <br/>\ncartoon, but my kid really likes them. They are videos of real trucks, <br/>\nor whatever the topic is and have a variety of (to my 4y kid) &quot;cool <br/>\nstuff that you don&#39;t see everyday.&quot;    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nE-&quot; I guess Arthur videos<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; are okay, except that I don&#39;t like the way the kids sometimes tease each<br/>\n&gt; other in a sing-songy, nah-nah-nah-nah tone (You can&#39;t go to camp! We&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; going on vacation!), as if this were just &quot;the way kids are.&quot;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Boy do I know what you mean there. I liked some Arthur, and other aimed <br/>\nat kids stuff, but alot of it is filled with rudeness presented as <br/>\n&quot;normal&quot;. I also hated the new baby episode that implies all babies <br/>\nmust have bottles, have horribly stinky diapers, and must sleep in a <br/>\ncage in another room and scream all night. But that&#39;s seen as normal in <br/>\nour society partly because of cartoons like this that reinforce it as <br/>\nnormal. I know it&#39;s not the fault of the cartoon, it&#39;s just annoying to <br/>\nsee the same old story. We did talk after the show about why people <br/>\nthink babies are that way, and how for many families, babies are not <br/>\nlike that. Breastfeeding, and sharing sleep, get rid of most of those <br/>\nthree problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhew, got carried away. Back to the suject.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nE-&quot; This is why I really prefer books  I have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; more of a chance to answer his questions or concerns.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Elsa Haas&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I really agree. Being there when they watch something new can also be <br/>\nhandy because you can have that same kind of chance. It also gives you <br/>\nthe chance to explore the story with him. You can ask him questions <br/>\nabout the material like &quot;Why do you think this character acted that <br/>\nway?&quot;, &quot;How did that character feel when...?&quot;, or &quot;What do you think <br/>\nthe character could have done instead?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that might help a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy B.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"D1bfiep7MmHt6KkUn5lt9jAgC7ro76aOMXlmQdPJvdNDvupoWY7TlATBXVbDVnsbM3JlzY3xi6A_SYVtZab_1sCe43WUP3EFepQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Non-scary cartoons?","postDate":"1006337355","msgId":28215,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4MjBFNzdCLjI0NDAlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PExPQkJJSkxOQU5GSEpHT05HRE1CR0VOQUNGQUEuRWxzYUhhYXNAc2kucnIuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28209,"nextInTopic":28217,"prevInTime":28214,"nextInTime":28216,"topicId":28165,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The story was about Toad worrying<br/>\nthat, because Frog was late to his birthday party, he might have fallen into<br/>\na hole/been eaten by monsters/gotten lost/etc. Because these are just the<br/>\nmorbid imaginings of Toad, who tends to be a worrywart, it hadnt bothered<br/>\nme, but of course Tyler saw the worrying bit and Toads going to get a rope<br/>\nto rescue Frog, and was not equally impressed by the happy ending in which<br/>\nFrog showed up, late to the party only because he had been wrapping Toads<br/>\ngift.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe like the George and Martha (hippos) videos so far. I guess Arthur videos<br/>\nare okay, except that I dont like the way the kids sometimes tease each<br/>\nother in a sing-songy, nah-nah-nah-nah tone (You cant go to camp! Were<br/>\ngoing on vacation!), as if this were just the way kids are.<br/>\n<br/>\nIm saying non-scary rather than non-violent because some might not<br/>\nconsider a cartoon in which sharks attack a boat with kids in it to be<br/>\nviolent (The Wild Thornberrys, on TV one Sunday - the kids got away<br/>\nunharmed). I told my husband I dont really want Tyler seeing sharks<br/>\n(crocodiles, etc.) attacking people, even if it is a supposedly<br/>\npro-environmental cartoon about an interesting (and apparently<br/>\nhomeschooling) family of world travelers. He said, Dont you think its a<br/>\ngood idea for him to learn that sharks can be dangerous?<br/>\n<br/>\nI said, Later in life. Right now hes had only three or four real-life<br/>\nexperiences in lakes and at beaches, and I dont want him being afraid of<br/>\nsomething that isnt even there. When we go somewhere where there are<br/>\ncrocodiles/sharks/etc., we should be the ones to worry about it, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also told him about the nine-year-old city kids in the Fresh Air Fund<br/>\nsummer camp I used to work at who were afraid to go near the lake because of<br/>\nJason (some murderous undead thing that comes out of a lake in the movie<br/>\nFriday the 13th, I was told). Doesnt seem fair to me to hit kids with this<br/>\nbefore they have any substantial experience in nature to counteract it. He<br/>\nsaw my point.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe liked one Babar video, but then suddenly found ourselves watching another<br/>\none featuring a war, complete with the razing and burning of an elephant<br/>\nvillage, the capturing of elephant slaves (who were then whipped), the mommy<br/>\nelephant with a metal collar and ropes around her neck, fleeing baby<br/>\nelephants, etc. My fault for not paying attention to the title or synopsis<br/>\non the video case, I suppose. Tyler started getting scared but didnt want<br/>\nto turn it off. So I let him watch the whole darn thing to the end and then<br/>\ntried to tell him it didnt really happen, that it was pretend and a story<br/>\nsomeone made up. Dont think that works.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater that day he cried during his sleep  dont know whether it was because<br/>\nof this video. I told him we werent going to watch it again because it was<br/>\ntoo scary and I didnt like it. He cried but I put it out of his reach.<br/>\nLater he seemed happy with George and Martha. Then I started wondering<br/>\nwhether, if you screw up and let a kid this age see something scary like<br/>\nthis a first time through, youve really got to let them watch it again and<br/>\nagain to process it. Dont know. Just want to avoid his seeing this sort<br/>\nof stuff in the first place, as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe seems to understand an awful lot about the world, but his grasp of what<br/>\npictures are supposed to stand for is still tenuous. The other day I was<br/>\nreading him a book in which two boys are sitting on the floor with a big<br/>\npicturebook in front of them, and he said, Book fall! I then realized that<br/>\nthere was blankness where the floor was supposed to be, and that it was only<br/>\nfrom other clues that I could tell the book was actually resting on the<br/>\nfloor and not hanging in midair. This is why I really prefer books  I have<br/>\nmore of a chance to answer his questions or concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nElsa Haas<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"Pam Hartley &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","profile":"pamhartley966","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"tJFA3j66nN_Ls-ncDreUFkl9LeStsCo7g0SkMWv5Z2xmhVMxswcp2tQE--05zBey-aYvh1_M-ebMtzXEC-yr8RMxBpZC0n4NfGVOTrAR","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: dishes","postDate":"1006323571","msgId":28203,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBHTjUwMDJCWTA4SjNMQG10YTcucGx0bjEzLnBiaS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":28200,"nextInTopic":28209,"prevInTime":28202,"nextInTime":28204,"topicId":28165,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
