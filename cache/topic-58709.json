I often think of this<br/>\npoem by Sally Simmons, that I read in _Learning A Loving Way of Life_ .<br/>\n<br/>\nMirror<br/>\n<br/>\nI see my mirror down the hall<br/>\nComing toward me -- three feet tall!<br/>\nShe talks and sings and acts like me.<br/>\nMagnified for all to see.<br/>\nShe comforts me when I am sad,<br/>\nShe yells and hits when she gets mad.<br/>\nSometimes I see my finer side --<br/>\nOften it&#39;s qualities I&#39;d rather hide!<br/>\nI&#39;m happiest, though, when I can see<br/>\nMy love reflected back to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it helps that we live in such a child hostile culture.<br/>\nMany times we are blamed for our children just acting like children<br/>\nand we are not supported in respecting their needs. That doesn&#39;t<br/>\nchange the fact that we are responsible for our actions, loving or<br/>\notherwise, to our children. And, the real double whammy can be to bear<br/>\nchildren and look to our elders with trust for support, and then find<br/>\nthat we have shortchanged our own needs and our children&#39;s needs in<br/>\nour search for *Their* approval. Sometimes it is easier to blame the<br/>\nmessenger rather than admit to ourselves just how deeply hurt we are<br/>\nby those we love and trust. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: modeling behavior - was Oh!","postDate":"1045241493","msgId":58719,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEtRjE2MEpNRHNsNUlJVE0wMDAwYjRhY0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":58709,"nextInTopic":58732,"prevInTime":58718,"nextInTime":58720,"topicId":58709,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
