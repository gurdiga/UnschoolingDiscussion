Told her a little bit about how I&#39;ve watched <br/>\nKatie (My most Unschooled child) learn so many things without me <br/>\nteaching her, and said &quot;Just relax. Take the whole summer off, and <br/>\nwatch your kids. Just observe them. They&#39;re learning, even when <br/>\nyou&#39;re NOT teaching them.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then she wanted to talk about some very cool curriculum she&#39;d <br/>\nfound at a homeschoolers&#39; conference, and about how they tested their <br/>\nboy (Katie&#39;s age...8...and a slow reader) and found out he has no <br/>\nperipheral vision (gimme a break) AND how they have lenses they can <br/>\nfit him with to help with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nugh. They have THAT kind of thing, at these homeschooler conferences? <br/>\nSheesh. But she wasn&#39;t going to get the lenses. Too expensive, but <br/>\nshe WAS so relieved to find out the reason WHY her son was such a <br/>\nlate starter and a slow reader...poor mom. Poor kids. Trapped in a <br/>\nschoolish mentality, and the stress that comes with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, sheesh.
