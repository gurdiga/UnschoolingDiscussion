After all these year it really<br/>\nquite cool to share the wonder of discovery with all my children. Whatever<br/>\nthat may be.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Michael reads a lot and he is a very private person. I feel religion and<br/>\nbeliefs are very personal. I do know, from our conversations, that he&#39;s not<br/>\ndoing anything more organized than finding his own beliefs. He&#39;s just<br/>\nrecently got his drivers license and he spend all his limited, because of<br/>\ncollege and his choices, spare time with friends on the weekend. I hope he<br/>\ndoes find what he is looking for. Whether it is my held belief or not. He&#39;s<br/>\nthe only one that knows his heart.<br/>\n<br/>\n    You asked someone else if they would go to different rituals. Well I&#39;d<br/>\nfeel honored to join in something so personal and intimate. I hope my<br/>\nchildren continue to trust and share with me all these thing they discover<br/>\nfascinating and that speaks to their heart.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just don&#39;t see how you can have this faith that they don&#39;t need &quot;fixing&quot;<br/>\n&gt; (and I agree!) and reconcile it with original sin.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not trying to be challenging, I&#39;m honestly asking about something I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t understand.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    The way I see this is that I really don&#39;t have much to do with it. God<br/>\nis the only one that can speak to our hearts. It&#39;s a personal relationship.<br/>\nI can explain my faith in the ways I beleive but my children have to make up<br/>\ntheir own mind. I&#39;ve seen, myself included, and heard of too many children<br/>\nturning their back to their parents religion and beliefs. I no longer<br/>\npractice in a church. Way to segregated and legalistic for me. I tryed as an<br/>\nadult but still didn&#39;t find what I was looking for. I&#39;m much happier with<br/>\nChrist and my beleifs being a personal relationship and leaving it as that.<br/>\nI hope that may have answered you question even though it wasn&#39;t really<br/>\ndirected at me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarb E<br/>\n&quot;He who is ashamed of asking is ashamed of learning.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n- Danish Proverb<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cool.
