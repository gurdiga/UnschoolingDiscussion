Doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not slimey! <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; He raised his kids nicely and did all kinds of physical family vacations <br/>\nwith <br/>\nthem. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s &quot;nicely&quot; mean? Whatever it is, it still doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not slimey. <br/>\nPhysical family vacas? Still doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not slimey.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; He was good to his mother, and his step father, and his sister. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, though those are all very noble traits, it still doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not <br/>\nslimey.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; He researched his historical parts and characters and locations himself, <br/>\ninstead of <br/>\njust showing up and taking someone else&#39;s word for it. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat makes him a good *actor*. What does that have to do with slimeyness?<br/>\n<br/>\nI happen to like/disslike people for who they *are*. (How they are in our <br/>\nworld. Who they are. What they stand for. What they say. Their beliefs. How they <br/>\ntreat people who are different. And so on.) Not if they&#39;re a great actor. So <br/>\nyes, my first reaction to Charlton Heston, is eeeeeeewwwwwww, because he&#39;s so <br/>\nslimey.
