I could let them form there own <br/>\nopinions on this issue, or on the issue of drugs, or any other societal <br/>\nissue, without ever sharing my views, but I want us to share our views, as a <br/>\nfamily. I also feel that a parent has a right to decide what is in the home, <br/>\nand if they don&#39;t want porno, or sexually exploitive materials  in their <br/>\nlives , they should have the right to make that rule. <br/>\n    &quot;Beanachtai&#39; geal&quot;                                     <br/>\n    (Bright blessings)                                                 <br/>\n           Sheree                                               <br/>\n       AIM: ShereeS411                                <br/>\n   ICQ# 78470094  <br/>\n&quot;Great spirits have always encountered opposition from mediocre minds.&quot; <br/>\n..Albert Einstein      <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"YcdNQE6xkTrwqgLawAf4Y44hTR3UbxXYKtY70c6238scAHB4PAq58eAYLctG-KdKj7L_K-0h7KvU","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Computers in Rooms  cosmo in the bathroom","postDate":"991937238","msgId":22503,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExNC4yNzQ5My4yODUxMWNkNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22499,"nextInTopic":22514,"prevInTime":22502,"nextInTime":22504,"topicId":22411,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/7/01 10:53:18 AM, bearspawprint@yahoo.com writes:  My mother was","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-688922221\">In a message dated 6/7/01 10:53:18 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bearspawprint@...\">bearspawprint@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Is your sorry brother really FAS or was that just a sibling epithet? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother was drunk when he was conceived, didn&#39;t know she was pregnant until <br/>\nshe was five months along, drank throughout, was out drinking and dancing <br/>\n(with my generous and concerned pre-med boyfriend, who had gone to take care <br/>\nof her nine-month-pregnant self and drive her home, because she was going to <br/>\ngo one way or another) the night she went into labor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had custody of him twice when he was growing up, when he was 4 and 5, and <br/>\nagain when he was 13, 14.

If they got <br/>\ntheir own computers we&#39;d let them have them in their rooms.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs it is, they stay up late and are online after we go to bed.  So it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmatter that the computers aren&#39;t in their own rooms, they still have privacy. <br/>\n I know each has looked at a bit of nasty sci-fi fan art (I mean of a sexual <br/>\nnature, which I think most readers here are considering &quot;nasty&quot;).  Someone <br/>\none night looked at porn sites.  They didn&#39;t keep on doing it (or they <br/>\nlearned to clean the trail of what shows as last sites visited, although I <br/>\ndon&#39;t check up on them and only noticed those in passing).  I know enough of <br/>\nwhat they ARE doing online that I&#39;m not worried about a little exploration, <br/>\nand they stay home a lot which is healthy.  If they really wanted to be <br/>\nseeing dirty pictures, they could do so at their other teen friends&#39; houses <br/>\nI&#39;m sure, or out in the community one way or another.  But they&#39;re home.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI found a Cosmopolitan magazine in Kirby&#39;s bathroom.  I had bought it myself, <br/>\nI forget why now.  Now it&#39;s in the cabinet in a boy&#39;s bathroom.  I left it <br/>\nthere and didn&#39;t tease him or shame him about it, just left the toilet paper <br/>\nI was delivering and didn&#39;t make a big deal.  Usually we get kids to deliver <br/>\ntoilet paper to the bathrooms, but that one day I did it myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have different priorities and fears.  My boys are 14 and 12.  I would <br/>\nbuy them Hustler magazines myself before I would try to shelter them totally <br/>\nfrom any awareness that such things exist.  Maybe I should do that anyway.  <br/>\nProbably there is no greater deterrent or sexual turn-off than &quot;My mom told <br/>\nme to look at this.&quot;  Eyew.  Maybe a unit study on the evil realities of <br/>\npornography.   If they learned to associate porn with their aging mom that <br/>\nmight put them off sex for life, though, and their future wives wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nappreciate that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t personally associate the internet with frightening evil, but I know <br/>\nsome people do.  I&#39;ve seen my kids use it all kinds of bright, useful, <br/>\nsensible ways they can share with their mom and little sister.  They&#39;re <br/>\nhonest kids who think.  It&#39;s no more dangerous than other situations, and <br/>\nless so since they&#39;re safe at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy idiot fetal-alcohol-syndrome half brother, on the other hand, doesn&#39;t like <br/>\ncomputers at all but got his Mormon teen girlfriend (some years ago) in a <br/>\ncompromising situation, having been photographed nude (and maybe with him, <br/>\nwhich is too gross for me to think much about) by a scuzzy <br/>\nillegal-snake-importing drug dealer and then being threatened with the <br/>\nrelease of the photos.  He would have been WAY better off on the internet in <br/>\nsome isolated bedroom somewhere.  They were briefly married, until he stole a <br/>\ntruck and some money from her relatives.  Now he has a girlfriend who&#39;s a <br/>\ntalented Indian artist.  Oh.  She&#39;s in jail for a knife fight with her <br/>\nbrother.
