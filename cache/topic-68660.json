They married just a few <br/>\nyears ago, he had one daughter she had two sons.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough we had good conversations about board games and non-spanking (they <br/>\ndefinitely don&#39;t spank) there were a dozen tense moments in which I could <br/>\nhave gotten through them by agreeing with something I didn&#39;t agree with, or <br/>\nsaying nothing when I had the strong urge to defend a child.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThey wanted me to tell Kirby what to do and when, because they wanted to tell <br/>\ntheir daughter wha to do and when.  The dad was advising the girls who had <br/>\ngathered to meet the prom dates (Kirby was separated from either group, he <br/>\nwas with us--six couples plus singles were separated) that they should go on <br/>\nto the restaurant and leave a message for the boys to meet them there.  They <br/>\nwould have taken Kirby too.  I said it wasn&#39;t much of a date if they didn&#39;t <br/>\ngo together, and maybe the boys had had car trouble, or something legitimate. <br/>\n I said I could take Kirby to meet them (I know the town).  The justification <br/>\nfor this pressure was that the spaghetti was about ready to put on the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone I like and respect was willing to mess up the prom date of half a <br/>\ndozen couples to keep from eating late.  What he had said was if that food <br/>\ngot put on the table, he was NOT going to leave to take Kirby if they called.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said I thought we should just take Kirby where the girls were then, and let <br/>\nhim wait with them, and we did that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mom said at some point in this discussion, &quot;Well what do you expect?  <br/>\nThey&#39;re teenaged boys.  They&#39;re ALL irresponsible.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI said mine weren&#39;t, and that we had gone up there so Kirby could go to the <br/>\nprom, not so I could eat spaghetti, so the prom definitely was more important.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was NOT their main answer, because their priority is the family eats <br/>\ntogether every night.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a tiny difference of priority like that can just about make or break a <br/>\nfriendship.  I think the kids&#39; happiness is more important than my personal <br/>\ninconvenience or preference, especially at a once-in-a-lifetime moment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it was getting time to go, I said I figured Holly was starting to look <br/>\nfor me to come home, and it was a two hour drive, so we should probably get <br/>\ngoing.  I said I would check and see if Kirby was ready to go.  The response <br/>\n(which COULD have just been &quot;Okay, glad you came, can we help you get your <br/>\nstuff?&quot;) was &quot;Too bad if he&#39;s not ready, if it&#39;s time, just tell him it&#39;s <br/>\ntime.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, it was KIRBY&#39;s trip to Los Alamos.  Though I could nudge him, I wasn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to command him to get in the car.  And it turned out their daughter was <br/>\ntalking about things to him that she really wanted to talk about, and he <br/>\nknows more of the people involved (her real mom, some other parents) than her <br/>\nfriends up there know, and she was benefiting greatly from Kirby&#39;s counsel.  <br/>\n(He honestly is a good counsellor and has been since he was a kid solving <br/>\nother kids&#39; spats.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would have been easier for them had I just treated Kirby like they treat <br/>\ntheir kids while we were there.  But I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only more-protective-than-they-were moment was when I expressed surprise <br/>\nand concern that they were going to Santa Fe to eat instead of eating in Los <br/>\nAlamos.  LOTS of kids in just two or three cars (a car and a van, or maybe <br/>\nvan and two cars) and I knew NONE of the drivers, and didn&#39;t know if they <br/>\nknew where they were going in Santa Fe, and how much party atmosphere there <br/>\nmight be, and I just hadn&#39;t known that part of the plan.  So the best driver <br/>\nwas assigned to take Kirby and his date in her car to make me feel better.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t horrible, it was just a good example of the awkward differences <br/>\nputting respect for children high on the list can cause, even with another <br/>\nliberal, child-loving family.  I can no longer abide the attitude, &quot;It <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t matter what he wants, he&#39;s a kid.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":146801095,"authorName":"Stacey Bowen&#39;s New Email Account","from":"&quot;Stacey Bowen&#39;s New Email Account&quot; &lt;staceybowen@...&gt;","profile":"toot3055","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] feeling alienated, and rooftops LONG","postDate":"1052745246","msgId":68660,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzQwMWMzMTg4OCQ1ZTA0ODgwMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBCT1dFTj4=","referencesHeader":"PDExMC4yMzZiMzFkYy4yYmYwYTc4NUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":68696,"prevInTime":68659,"nextInTime":68661,"topicId":68660,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a neighbor who has a dd in 4th gr and twins in K.

I met her about 2 years ago.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDh and I took our kids out of school last year, and she has been very supportive to me.  She calls<br/>\nand e-mails with questions about what we do.  She has brought the kids over to play with mine<br/>\non their days off.  HOWEVER....it is like we have this underground friendship.  She has <br/>\ninvited me to one of those &quot;all come over and bring your checkbook&quot; parties...Southern Living?  All<br/>\nof the p.s. moms I used to be acquainted with were there.  She had a Holt and a Gatto book<br/>\nthat I had lent to her...which she had told me she loved....and in fact, was going to get for herself.<br/>\nShe wanted to return them to me at the party.  She had them double wrapped in opaque plastic<br/>\nbags, and waited until almost everyone left before bringing them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the party I listened to story after story about unhappy kids, guidance counselors<br/>\noverstepping their bounds, homework taking them into bedtime hours, and parents literally<br/>\nafraid to rock the boat and do anything about it.  (I don&#39;t know if I am being hypocritical...as<br/>\nI didn&#39;t do much about it when my kids were in either...other than accept my duty as the Royal <br/>\nPain in the Teacher&#39;s Bottom, which really had no positive effect to speak of).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...it was weird.  One mom, who had a child in my son&#39;s K class last year, went on<br/>\nand on about the reading assessments, and the math assessments, and the color code punishment<br/>\nsystem:  every classroom now has a chart up front, the kids get moved from green, to yellow, to <br/>\norange, to red....if they misbehave.  If they make it to purple, down to the principal.  The teachers<br/>\nare spending more time at that chart....constantly threatening to &quot;move someone to yellow&quot;...etc.<br/>\nCan you imagine this for any age?  I finally spoke up and asked why the parents allow this in<br/>\nthe classroom.  How on earth does the teacher have any time to help the children with all of this<br/>\nnonsense going on?  They looked at me like I had just lifted my leg and peed on the carpet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey just ignored me after that.  One continued the thread with a story of how one of<br/>\nthe 4th grade teachers who hates band kids, put a whole table full of them on yellow for making<br/>\ntoo many disruptions as they were trying to leave in the middle of class to go to band practice.  <br/>\nSince they were on yellow, she held them back in the class for 20 minutes, not letting them leave.<br/>\nWhen they finally did get to band, the band director put them on yellow for being late.  I&#39;m not sure<br/>\nwhat exactly happened after that...but whenever the kids get put on something other than green,<br/>\nsome sort of punishment is assigned.   <br/>\n(We experienced things like this when my oldest was in 4th...but they didn&#39;t have the color code<br/>\nsystem, yet....he would raise his hand to leave class, and the teacher would tell him not to <br/>\ninterrupt, just get up and leave.  The next time, when he just got up to leave, she would yell at him<br/>\nfor getting up in the middle of class).<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the original topic.....there have defininately been changes with my old friends, and family<br/>\nmembers who I used to be very close to.  I know people in all of the situations I have been reading<br/>\nabout here....women who have to work because their families have become dependent on their incomes <br/>\nthrough large home and fancy car purchases ...women who claim that they have to work, because they<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t stand being around their kids all day...(some who take their kids to daycare, even when they<br/>\nhave the day off) and women who are sahm&#39;s, and feel that finally being able to send their last child to <br/>\nfull-time school is the reward for all of their &quot;hard work.&quot;  I tend to get frustrated and depressed when<br/>\nI think too much about not knowing how to get through to this many people...but I do agree with the <br/>\n&quot;shout it from the rooftops&quot; philosophy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have another daycare popping up here....that makes 3 large full-time centers within a 3 mile <br/>\nstretch.  (And we&#39;re in a pretty rural area).  The latest one is literally one parking lot away from another.  <br/>\nWhen the last one was built, right along a major thoroughfare...my husband joked, and said &quot;Can&#39;t you <br/>\njust feel the excitement...parents won&#39;t even have to stop...they can just toss them out the door as they <br/>\ndrive by.&quot;  One has a huge banner they posted across the front....&quot;OPEN 6 AM until 7 PM ! ! !&quot;  I just <br/>\nfeel ill every time I drive by, and see those plastic playgrounds with cold concrete or pebble floors...mobbed <br/>\nwith kids, all fenced in and climbing on top of one another.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, too depressing for a Monday morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe these are the rooftops we should start with...<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking megaphones...and cans of creamed corn!  (I loved that comment, by the way!)<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the worst that could happen, they&#39;d think we&#39;re weird?<br/>\n<br/>\nI stop being depressed about alienation, when I consider what I am missing with these moms...<br/>\nmerely the opportunity to complain about everything.  That&#39;s really all we did before I left ps....<br/>\ncommiserate to one another.  I don&#39;t have too much to complain about anymore....and that&#39;s a <br/>\ntremendously beautiful thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are right, Mary....life is GOOD!<br/>\nStacey <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68679,"nextTopicId":68417}}
