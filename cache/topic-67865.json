I just ordered a book called<br/>\n_Bathtub Science_ or something like that.

Do they have a <br/>\nbathtub? LOL When I listed &quot;Everything I Have Ever Learned&quot; per <br/>\nSandra Dodd&#39;s advice in an article about parental deschooling, one of <br/>\nthe things in that list is my knowledge of how air pressure forces <br/>\nwater up into a sealed tubular structure, when the opening of the <br/>\ntube is held under water. (cup, bathtub, 9 year old brain) I know <br/>\nthat water will &quot;climb&quot; inside a cup, by playing with it in the tub. <br/>\nAnd, some time in my readings as a child, or possibly from a science <br/>\nprogram on TV, I heard about the physics behind that phenomenon (air <br/>\npressure on the surface of the water being greater than the air <br/>\npressure inside the cup)<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, we want to provide lots of opportunities, but my point is, <br/>\nyour kids will learn from things you can&#39;t even imagine. Sort of like <br/>\nthe principle of the box the toy came in, being lots more fun than <br/>\nthe toy itself. Relax and watch your kids play for awhile.

By the time he was supposed to be registering for K<br/>\nI started thinking about how horrible I thought it would be for him to have<br/>\nto sit through weeks and weeks of learning the alphabet when he was already<br/>\nreading.

I never followed TWTM<br/>\n&quot;by the book&quot; and we did lots of hands-on projects and field trips...they<br/>\njust weren&#39;t really of any interest to my boys.
