The kids<br/>\n&gt; (boys, 8 and 6) were staying up till 1, 2 in the AM<br/>\n&gt; and as a result I was staying up till 3, 4.  They<br/>\n&gt; never went to bed early even when they were in school,<br/>\n&gt; but it became a little extreme - even for their<br/>\n&gt; nocturnal momma!  So, we had a family discussion about<br/>\n&gt; it, and compromised on a time (for us, 9:45) that the<br/>\n&gt; kids would start to get ready for bed - baths or<br/>\n&gt; showers, brush teeth, pick up their room a bit (with<br/>\n&gt; our help) and pick out books to read or to be read to<br/>\n&gt; them.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All this was decided with the proviso that if they<br/>\n&gt; were involved in something they could take an<br/>\n&gt; additional 15 min or whatever time they needed to<br/>\n&gt; complete it.  Also, I made the commitment to be<br/>\n&gt; available to them for a hour to read to them or talk,<br/>\n&gt; sing, whatever, in their room.  So at about 11 or so,<br/>\n&gt; I close their door and they can sleep, sit in bed and<br/>\n&gt; read, talk to each other, read to each other, what<br/>\n&gt; have you. They know too that they are always welcome<br/>\n&gt; in our bed if they feel like it.  I guess we have more<br/>\n&gt; of a flexible guideline for them to be in their room<br/>\n&gt; and (preferably) in bed than a bedtime.  Having this<br/>\n&gt; guideline before it&#39;s time for bed really seems to<br/>\n&gt; help them wind down a lot.  That way when I gently<br/>\n&gt; remind them that it&#39;s 9:30, and then 9;45, they know<br/>\n&gt; they still have lots of time to &#39;be up&#39; and do some<br/>\n&gt; more stuff.  They also know that it&#39;s flexible and we<br/>\n&gt; will respect their input and needs if they need to be<br/>\n&gt; up doing something longer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for your advice!

My ds was happy and having a great time.  Kindergarten <br/>\nwas playtime to him and he wanted to stay.  They were having holiday parties and <br/>\nplays, and he was in art class.  An award party for advanced readers, and <br/>\ntons of fun things.  He wasn&#39;t ready to leave.  I was ready for him to leave, I <br/>\nhad regained my confidence to live the way we always had.  School was hard on <br/>\nour family, and we definitely never had much of a schedule and that was a real <br/>\nchallenge.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe all talked about it and he knew what life was like before.  He didn&#39;t <br/>\nreally like getting up at the same time everyday, or missing out on shopping and <br/>\nparks and all that.  Playing with his brother, being with us.  He didn&#39;t like <br/>\nwhen the teachers made him wait to do things because other kids didn&#39;t know how <br/>\nand they needed help first or when they counldn&#39;t go outside on gorgeous days <br/>\ncuz the teachers had things to do.  So unless it was FUN, he wasn&#39;t thrilled. <br/>\n He chose to stay in with the option of staying home whenever he wanted.  He <br/>\nfelt good to finish the year and so did I (sort of).  We set aside our true <br/>\nliving for many months and I can never get that back.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe hasn&#39;t really mentioned school since the end of last year.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids are choosing to stay in and see it as fun and social, awesome.  <br/>\nBut if it&#39;s a struggle in the mornings and the yelling kinda gets you all off <br/>\non the wrong foot, then I&#39;d end it now.  Unlearn all that&#39;s not needed and <br/>\nrecapture what life was like before schooling.  Enjoy them now in all their <br/>\nfreedom and innocence.  I knew what that was before kindergarten and boy!!! do I <br/>\nappreciate it soooo much more now that it&#39;s over.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for bedtimes, get a &quot;winding down for the day&quot; routine going.  Baths, <br/>\nreading stories, or whatever gets everyone in a lazy, comfy mood.  Our 3 year old <br/>\nis a fantastic snoozer so he usually tells us when he&#39;s ready.  He&#39;ll ask if <br/>\nit&#39;s naptime yet.   As for our 7 year old, he loves reading time and he likes <br/>\nto lay in our bed and watch TV, sometimes with us or while we&#39;re in the living <br/>\nroom watchin&#39; our own stuff.  But he is usually ready by 10 or so.  He&#39;ll play <br/>\nhis gameboy or watch videos on it until he&#39;s alseep.  I think the key is that <br/>\nif they want to stay up, they can.  We just ask that it&#39;s quiet when we are <br/>\nin bed.  They know daddy has to work.  They know I like to take short naps <br/>\nsometimes during the day.  We have always made an effort to do quiet things if <br/>\nsomeone in the house is resting and that just extends into the night too. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have a toddler and a newborn too.  So sleep is essential for you when you <br/>\ncan get it.  Make it a point that staying up is their choice but once you and <br/>\nyour hubby are in bed or the little ones are in bed for the night, that it is <br/>\ntime for quiet activities.  But I would definitely get jammies on and all <br/>\nthat.  That seems to help with winding down.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nHTH<br/>\nPamela <br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":207258001,"authorName":"Leah","from":"&quot;Leah&quot; &lt;kainoa72@...&gt;","profile":"leahkainoa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] This is my first post...","postDate":"1106843750","msgId":102804,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYjEwMWM1MDQ4ZSQ0NmJmODFiMCQ3ZWI4MmI0NEBLaXRjaGVuUEM+","inReplyToHeader":"PHAwNjExMDQ2OGJlMWU2NDBmYWM4NUBbMjA0LjE4OS4xMS40MV0+"},"prevInTopic":102801,"nextInTopic":102809,"prevInTime":102803,"nextInTime":102805,"topicId":102789,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How about just not go to school when your kids don t want to go... let them stay home when they want to, and go when they want to I ve not posted before, but","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1572882970\">&quot;How about just not go to school when your kids don&#39;t want to go... let<br/>\nthem<br/>\nstay home when they want to, and go when they want to&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve not posted before, but just wanted to note that in our state a<br/>\nparent can be charged for their child&#39;s truancy.

I&#39;m fairly new here (been lurking for some<br/>\n </span></blockquote>time) and don&#39;t think I&#39;ve posted here yet.  Jill,<br/>\nyour post really resonated with me.  We too were<br/>\nthrilled to get into an alternative school by lottery<br/>\nin our neck of the woods (Brooklyn, NY) and it didn&#39;t<br/>\nlive up to our expectations.  My oldest son (8) ended<br/>\nup falling thru the cracks big time and I began trying<br/>\nto advocate for him with the Board of Ed.  I decided<br/>\nthis past summer that he wasn&#39;t going back to school. <br/>\nI wanted to pull him out in April of last year but<br/>\neveryone advised me not to as it would limit our<br/>\n&#39;choices&#39; as we moved forward, blah, blah, blah. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I had listened to my instincts instead of<br/>\n&#39;everyone&#39;.  It would have been two months less<br/>\ntorture for my ds.  Your situation sounds a bit<br/>\ndifferent, but if your kids really want it, you may<br/>\nwant to consider taking them out of school sooner than<br/>\nlater.  On the brighter side, the big pluses of their<br/>\nschool experience was that we met some really great<br/>\nfamilies, most of whom we still see on a regualar<br/>\nbasis.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had some issues surrounding the bedtime thing as<br/>\nwell (mostly my husband had the issues).  The kids<br/>\n(boys, 8 and 6) were staying up till 1, 2 in the AM<br/>\nand as a result I was staying up till 3, 4.  They<br/>\nnever went to bed early even when they were in school,<br/>\nbut it became a little extreme - even for their<br/>\nnocturnal momma!  So, we had a family discussion about<br/>\nit, and compromised on a time (for us, 9:45) that the<br/>\nkids would start to get ready for bed - baths or<br/>\nshowers, brush teeth, pick up their room a bit (with<br/>\nour help) and pick out books to read or to be read to<br/>\nthem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll this was decided with the proviso that if they<br/>\nwere involved in something they could take an<br/>\nadditional 15 min or whatever time they needed to<br/>\ncomplete it.  Also, I made the commitment to be<br/>\navailable to them for a hour to read to them or talk,<br/>\nsing, whatever, in their room.  So at about 11 or so,<br/>\nI close their door and they can sleep, sit in bed and<br/>\nread, talk to each other, read to each other, what<br/>\nhave you. They know too that they are always welcome<br/>\nin our bed if they feel like it.  I guess we have more<br/>\nof a flexible guideline for them to be in their room<br/>\nand (preferably) in bed than a bedtime.  Having this<br/>\nguideline before it&#39;s time for bed really seems to<br/>\nhelp them wind down a lot.  That way when I gently<br/>\nremind them that it&#39;s 9:30, and then 9;45, they know<br/>\nthey still have lots of time to &#39;be up&#39; and do some<br/>\nmore stuff.  They also know that it&#39;s flexible and we<br/>\nwill respect their input and needs if they need to be<br/>\nup doing something longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids don&#39;t take baths or showers every day, but<br/>\nwhen they do at night, I see a big difference in how<br/>\nrelaxed and &#39;ready&#39; for bed (as in actually sleeping)<br/>\nthey are.  Also, my kids sometimes drink tea with me<br/>\nbefore bed.  They love cocoa spice (yogi tea brand),<br/>\nbut you can make your own with cocoa powder, cinnamon<br/>\nand/or cardamom, and a little honey and milk.  We<br/>\nnever did the hot milk thing, but I can see how that<br/>\nmight be soothing as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been a few weeks of doing this and has made a<br/>\nhuge difference.  We&#39;ve had no complaints from them<br/>\nabout it what-so-ever and we&#39;ve all been getting up a<br/>\nbit earlier (tho-they are never up before 10Am) which<br/>\ngives us a jump on the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps. Sorry it got so long<br/>\n<br/>\n-Pamela, mom to Joshua (8) and Aaron (6)&gt; <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

When the older two were babies, the <br/>\nthought of school never sat well with me.  I looked into <br/>\nhomeschooling and thought that would be the path we would take <br/>\n(without the support of my family, of course).  Then I found out <br/>\nabout a Charter School, without going into detail, it sounded good <br/>\nto me at that point.  We got in (they hold a lottery) and right now, <br/>\nmy oldest two kids are enrolled there (1st grade and K).  It&#39;s not <br/>\nwhat I thought it would be.  (Surprise, surprise!)  They have an <br/>\nopen door policy, encourage parent participation as much as possible <br/>\nand emphasize community, especially in the school.  Grades are mixed <br/>\nand they profess hands on activities.  It is better than a public <br/>\nschool.  But not good enough.  I guess I fooled myself into thinking <br/>\nthe school would be able to teach my kids better than them learning <br/>\non their own.  I have two other kids now, that makes it impossible <br/>\nfor me to be as involved as I want to be.  We&#39;ve been planning on <br/>\nhsing for high school because the school only goes up to 8th grade, <br/>\nso the kids are familiar with the idea of it.  They ask how much <br/>\nlonger (until they can hs).  They tell me they like school, but <br/>\nwould rather stay home.  I dread getting up mornings, we yell and <br/>\nget a rather harsh start just about every day (my dd has tactile <br/>\nissues and getting dressed is a fiasco, especially under <br/>\npressure!).  I love the idea of unschooling, it just fits so well <br/>\nwith my relaxed attitude :)  (Although my mother calls it <br/>\nirresponsible...)  The kids do enjoy going to school, so I think we <br/>\nare going to finish up the year and just not go back next year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking forward to the freedom, all aspects of it.
