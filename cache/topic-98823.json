My partner had it on and<br/>\nSebastian woke up and started watching it.  Instead of<br/>\nturning it off (we had been discussing whether or not<br/>\nLOTR would be appropriate for him to view etc.) we let<br/>\nhim watch and made sure to answer his questions like,<br/>\n&#39;what&#39;s happening&#39;, &#39;what&#39;s that&#39; etc.  A few times he<br/>\nwould say &#39;I&#39;m scared&#39; and a couple times we would<br/>\ncheck in with him and ask him if he was scared.  A<br/>\ncouple times I could tell by his facial expression<br/>\nthat something was a little intense for him.  He did<br/>\nalright though!  He was very interested in who Golem<br/>\nwas.  He kept calling him a baby monkey which I got a<br/>\ngood chuckle out of.  He liked the horses, and<br/>\neverytime he saw a group of people marching towards a<br/>\nbattle scene, he thought they were doing a parade! LOL<br/>\nOnce when Golem got beat up, Sebastian mentioned how<br/>\nsomeone &#39;kicked&#39; him and we talked about how that<br/>\nprobably hurt Golem and made him sad and how that was<br/>\nrude and bad manners.  My partner chimed in that they<br/>\nwould check to see if Golem was ok.  And, after about<br/>\n5 min. he was done, and asked to watch Little Bill<br/>\ninstead.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sure did a lot of worrying about whether or not it<br/>\nwould be appropriate for him to view LOTR and am not<br/>\nsure if it was worth all the worry!  A neat<br/>\nunschooling experiment.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I&#39;m trying to share info on unschooling to my<br/>\npartner who is not as embracing of it as I am, and<br/>\nalthough he is quite radical, thinks it may be too<br/>\nradical.  He said he would read up on it so he can<br/>\nmake a more &#39;educated&#39; opininion.  So, if anyone has<br/>\nany good, not too lengthy snips that would be good to<br/>\ne-mail him, please let me know.
