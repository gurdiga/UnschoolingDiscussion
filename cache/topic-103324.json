But like you, I have had to take a close look at reality.... that while *I* think the all natural, low tech, warm, flowing, singing atmosphere of Waldorf and other different schooling alternatives, are really quite enchanting for me, my daughter would walk all over that stuff.  Some of my friends have children who seem to be perfectly suited to such places, but my daughter has her own agenda, and that aint it.  I&#39;m finding (duh ;) ) that if I really want to follow my child (4.5yo) that I need to let go of my own preconceived notions about what would be ideal for her.  Just when I think I know something, she really shuts me up.  Like about a year ago my husband brought home an antique school desk for me and Bethany to use in our homeschool.  I completely railed against it because I did NOT plan to do school at home!  I wanted it out.  Well, my daughter LOVED it.  She kept all her markers and crayons and paper under it and would sit there for hours drawing and cutting and pasting.  I was completely amazed.  My child never sat *anywhere* for more than about 5 minutes before.  So, I learned to just keep my mouth shut and watch.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah Harper<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debbliz@...\">debbliz@...</a><br/>\nMomma to Bethany 6-1-00<br/>\nWife to Tom 7-9-99<br/>\nAPI of the Raleigh Area<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.attachmentparenting.org/\">http://www.attachmentparenting.org/</a><br/>\nPeaceful Parenting for a Peaceful World<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59925222,"authorName":"queenjane555","from":"&quot;queenjane555&quot; &lt;queenjane555@...&gt;","profile":"queenjane555","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: &quot;I wish I had known...&quot;","postDate":"1108321714","msgId":103390,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGN1bzhqaStsM2s2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDdFODIwN0UzLjNEN0VCNzkxLjBDOEQ0NUE4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103387,"nextInTopic":103398,"prevInTime":103389,"nextInTime":103391,"topicId":103324,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I know a bit about LLL as I have been a member for a long time and most of my friends are LLLLeaders, but I am not a leader and so probably should not have made statements about that organization.  I certainly don&#39;t want to be spreading misinformation, so I thank those who have clarified LLL&#39;s workings and position.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the topic of homeschooling, this topic is brought up frequently on our local email list as many many of us are emerging homeschoolers (I would say at least half, maybe more), though information is always shared with OT in the subject line so as to distinguish this from the core of AP.  We once had a wonderful meeting based on the 8 ideals of school-aged children that centered around local educational alternatives.  We hosted a local Montessorian, a local Waldorf school instructor, and a local homeschooler.  Each presented information about their institution and their basic philosophies.  The homeschooler doing an excellent job of presenting broad information about varying homeschooling philosophies with a focus on traditional schooling at home and unschooling which juxtaposed nicely against the other presenters.  She also provided many handouts with basic information about local homeschooling requirements and local support groups.  A leader applicant organized and led this meeting and I have to say it was one of the best meetings we&#39;ve ever had.  There was really good information shared with an excellent member turnout.  The meeting was a huge success.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it seems to me that most folks are sour on the public school system, but there are varied ideas about what is best for the individual children.  I think that unschooling is excellent for all children, however, there are some children that are thriving in Montessori, and others in Waldorf schools.  API encourages us to study our children and learn what they like and what their preferred learning styles are.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf those of us that are (or are planning on) homeschooling I would say about half are unschoolers.  Then there are those in our group that are Christian and so choose to homeschool for religious reasons and choose a curriculum like Sonlight.  Still others who are attached, but simply not willing to completely let go and completely trust their children and still feel some need to see learning in measurable packets, choose some other unit studies program or a Montessori or Waldorf at home approach.  Most everyone does, however, purport to follow (to the degree they are capable of handling at the moment) their child&#39;s lead within the limited framework of the HS philosophy they choose, rather than following a strict calendar or plan for the day/week/year.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I knew from the time my daughter was about 3 weeks old and I had fallen completely in Earth-shattering love with her that the only way I could do the blessing of mothering her justice would be to respect her for the incredible individual person that she is (she could be the next Messiah you know! ;) ).... by treating her with consideration, concern, compassion, respect, empathy, and all the love in my heart.  Attachment Parenting is a label that fit fairly well with the lifestyle I was living, and homeschooling seemed to be the only educational option that would hold her up as the lone authority on herself and celebrate her individuality and her interests.  I will settle for nothing less.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah Harper<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debbliz@...\">debbliz@...</a><br/>\nMomma to Bethany 6-1-00<br/>\nWife to Tom 7-9-99<br/>\nAPI of the Raleigh Area<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.attachmentparenting.org/\">http://www.attachmentparenting.org/</a><br/>\nPeaceful Parenting for a Peaceful World<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, February 12, 2005 4:44 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] &quot;I wish I had known...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 2/12/05 1:43:34 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debbliz@...\">debbliz@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; They discourage us from talking about these at meetings specifically <br/>\n  because they don&#39;t want folks to think you have to cloth diaper and throw away your <br/>\n  TV to be AP.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Good!  because they don&#39;t have anything to do with physical closeness and <br/>\n  safety and acceptance of the child&#39;s needs in the moment, do they?

I am a Leader of a local NC chapter affiliated with API so I can speak for them.  They are not an off shoot of LLL, however, there is much mutual respect between the two organizations and API has mirrored many of LLL&#39;s policies.  Still, in general, API has much less red tape than LLL.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMuch I&#39;d like to say about the conversation I have seen here on this topic, but I will try to be brief for everyone&#39;s sake. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, attachment parenting according to API is a general philosophy of raising children with respect and empathy.  They offer 8 Ideals of Attachment Parenting for infants, and another set for School-aged children, that they suggest help to foster a strong attachment between parent and child.  You can see these ideals at the website above if you are interested.  In brief they are breastfeeding, baby wearing, co-sleeping, POSITIVE DISCIPLINE, maintaining family balance, responding sensitively, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, the issues that I am seeing discussed here as associated with attachment parenting, like sugar, TV, as well as issues like circumcision and vaccination, are issues that are fringe to AP and on which API takes no stand other than to say that they encourage every parent to be as informed as possible so as to make the best choices for their own families.  They discourage us from talking about these at meetings specifically because they don&#39;t want folks to think you have to cloth diaper and throw away your TV to be AP.  AP is about encouraging strong attachment, rather than pushing independence.  I think that most of these fringe issues are big issues to any parent who is a conscious thinking breathing, heavily involved parent.  It is not Attachment Parenting that is the source of these issues though.  Again, API only encourages parents to educate themselves about the issues so that they can make thoughtful and informed decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThirdly, API does have guidelines for leaders to follow.  The format of the meetings is completely open to the area specific leaders.  API headquarters basically only asks that we stay on topic with the 8 ideals or some offshoot there-of and avoid those fringe issues.  They suggest that if folks want information about those other issues, that folks can organize enrichment meetings, like LLL, that happen outside of the API regular meetings, to discuss those things.  They do have a book list like LLL, and actually, their list is a short one appended by anything on the LLL booklist.  They do not script us like LLL does with The Breastfeeding Answer Book, from which LLL Leaders literally read answers to questions.  Rather, they give us the 8 ideals and the research to support them, as well as evidence for the case of raising children compassionately (with respect for their individuality) and then ask us to do our best to provide this information and to support parents and children.  The only really limit us in that they ask us to keep our advice in accord with their philosophy, which only makes sense.  If we want to offer other advice, then we should start our own parenting group and not align ourselves with API.  I chose to become a leader with this group because I embrace AP and have benefited from this group greatly, and also because I liked that Leaders were not asked to be Robots or simply talking heads.  They do not have many rules at all, really, but they do request that the library be kept in accord with their bibliography.  Again, they want to be sure that groups carrying their name represent their philosophy.  Not stifling, but common sensical.  We actually decided to expand our library in the interest of providing more information to parents, but we have clearly marked which books are part of the API library and which are shared/donated items that have not yet been approved by API as representative of their philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, I would add that I have seen much of these turn-off aspects of attachment parenting folks in our own group.  There are fringe issues, and they have been somewhat divisive within our group when they have come up.  Most moms feel very passionately about these things whichever camp they subscribe to.  I think the link between AP parents and these issues, though, is that the parents are willing to invest themselves heavily into doing whatever they believe is best for their child.  They believe AP is best for their child, and they believe that wherever they stand on TV is the best they can do for their child.  As a leader it is my job to moderate and ask folks to take such conversations offlist or outside the meeting that are outside the scope of API&#39;s mission and are likely to undermine the goal of supporting one another in the core philosophy of attachment parenting.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAn important afterthought that I wanted to address is that API would never condone spanking or other violence on children.  Still, there are parents in our group who have spanked, and probably some who still do.  But API clearly maintains their position here of advocating the use of Positive Discipline, which spanking clearly is not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has any questions about attachment parenting or API philosophy feel free to post and ask, or email me offlist at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debbliz@...\">debbliz@...</a>.  I also encourage you to check out the API website as it has lots of really good information.  And if anyone is interested in becoming an API support group leader, it is actually quite easy to get approved as a Leader and start up your own group in your area, or join an existing group and change the rigidity that you don&#39;t like.  You can find this info on the website as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, after just inserting my signature line I re-read API&#39;s motto of Peaceful Parenting for a Peaceful World and it reminded me of Sandra&#39;s last post on this topic, about creating peace in our own little corner of the world, right in our home with our children, rather than fighting so hard to save the whole world.  That is really what this motto is all about.  The more folks there are involved in peaceful respectful warm and loving parenting the more empathy and peace their will be in future generations and this can only lead to a more peaceful world.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah Harper<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debbliz@...\">debbliz@...</a><br/>\nMomma to Bethany 6-1-00<br/>\nWife to Tom 7-9-99<br/>\nAPI of the Raleigh Area<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.attachmentparenting.org/\">http://www.attachmentparenting.org/</a><br/>\nPeaceful Parenting for a Peaceful World<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, February 12, 2005 12:28 PM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] &quot;I wish I had known...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -= The discussion is good, but the format<br/>\n  is stilted.

And, as a bonus, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t feel like such a prissy ass anymore.  :-D<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way in which the AP group IS weird is just funny to observe.  They seem<br/>\nto be quite open and flowing with their children, but each meeting is<br/>\nconducted strictly and rigidly, without deviation, according to the<br/>\ndirectives from some AP home office.  The discussion is good, but the format<br/>\nis stilted.  I offered to donate a couple of books to the lending library,<br/>\nand they said they had to check with the central group to see if they&#39;re<br/>\n&quot;approved&quot; first.  Yikes!  I think they need to take a cue from their kids<br/>\nand loosen up a bit, but they&#39;re very nice people.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie in NY<br/>\n________________________________________________<br/>\n&quot;The founding fathers in their wisdom decided that children were an<br/>\nunnatural strain on their parents.

I would never dissuade <br/>\nanyone from learning about and practicing attachment parenting. But I <br/>\nwant to address the ways that attachment parenting and unschooling can <br/>\nsometimes be at odds with each other, at least in the parent&#39;s mind <br/>\n(they are not at odds with eachother in reality, IMO).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; For me, with La Leche League, it was encouraged that we consider <br/>\n&gt; ourselves our children&#39;s partners, and that we read The Continuum <br/>\n&gt; Concept, and not try to press our kids to be separated from us until <br/>\n&gt; they were good and ready and wanted on their own to walk away a ways <br/>\n&gt; or to stay at someone else&#39;s house. Sure enough, that worked! It <br/>\n&gt; worked really, really well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, this is what AP is all about in its purest sense, and this is the <br/>\nsingle concept of AP. Bed sharing, breastfeeding on demand, babywearing <br/>\nin a sling or soft carrier, responding to baby&#39;s cries, etc. I think <br/>\nwhere things get muddy is when you look at the different kinds of people <br/>\nwho are practicing AP. Anyone who does it is necessarily the kind of <br/>\nperson who is willing to think outside the box and go against the <br/>\nmainstream. So by default a large proportion of those who practice AP <br/>\nare also against the mainstream in other aspects of their lives: they <br/>\nare often ultra-crunchy, politically very left, often involved in <br/>\nspiritual pursuits outside the mainstream, concerned about sustainable <br/>\nliving, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when their kids are babies it&#39;s all good because the babies pretty <br/>\nmuch have to go along with the philosophy of the parents, which, in our <br/>\ncase, is very heavily influenced by the excesses of our culture, our <br/>\ndisproportionate use of resources, and the military-industrial complex <br/>\nthat drives our society (our choices are based on our opinions about <br/>\nthese things--so for example I don&#39;t shop at Wal-Mart because I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to support them, I buy free-trade coffee, etc). I know many other <br/>\nAP parents who share these values.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Issues of TV and plastic toys and organic juice and t-shirts with <br/>\n&gt; Disney characters on them never entered into it, and as it was a <br/>\n&gt; pretty simple philosophical point (not a TON of points, one basic <br/>\n&gt; principle) nobody could have worked those in and still called it <br/>\n&gt; &quot;attachment parenting.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So yes, some AP groups may have this kind of flavor. It&#39;s very much the <br/>\nMothering Magazine kind of thing--touting all natural toys, organic <br/>\nfoods, cloth diapers, alternative medicine, and abhoring commercialism, <br/>\nTV, video games, and junk food. And I *have* felt judged in certain <br/>\ncircumstances because I made choices that were not as &quot;alternative&quot; as <br/>\nothers when our babies were young. ***The thing is, many of these AP <br/>\nmoms are complete control freaks because they are trying so hard to <br/>\n&quot;protect&quot; their kids from mainstream culture. That&#39;s where it conflicts <br/>\nwith unschooling.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have come to understand is that MY philosophy in life is just <br/>\nMINE--and that at 4 and 1 my kids can&#39;t possibly feel the same way that <br/>\nI do about Wal-Mart or sweatshops or oil wars. It&#39;s been hard to realize <br/>\nthat and let go, but I&#39;m so glad I did. In fact, I let my subscription <br/>\nto Mothering expire because I just don&#39;t have any use for it any more. <br/>\nNow I buy it as a shower gift for new moms, becasue I do think they are <br/>\nright on about baby care (although they refuse to print an article on <br/>\nElimination Communication, which is really wierd).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And what&#39;s TRULY weird is when people treat it as a temporary <br/>\n&gt; philosophy, to be thrown off when a kid is three or five years old.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, that&#39;s what gets me too. There&#39;s a lady who I met in La Leche <br/>\nLeague, who is very AP/crunchy but has gone the Waldorf route and her <br/>\nkids get no TV, no sugar, very few toys, and she is very short tempered <br/>\nwith them when they complain about it. There&#39;s another one I know who <br/>\nwas a huge influence on me (introduced me to extended breastfeeding, <br/>\nbought me my first subscription to Mothering) and now she is actually <br/>\nspanking her kids. Another one is dead set against homeschooling, let <br/>\nalone unschooling. Oh, and they all use time outs and other shaming <br/>\ntypes of discipline. One of them actually gave her 5yo daughter a buzz <br/>\ncut as a punishment for cutting her little brother&#39;s hair! I don&#39;t get it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Once we trusted Kirby and he trusted us, nothing was going to induce <br/>\n&gt; us to break that bond if we didn&#39;t have to, and that made unschooling <br/>\n&gt; a snap.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That was my motivation too--not to break that bond. I thank my lucky <br/>\nstars every day that I discovered unschooling and that I have had the <br/>\nopportunity to learn from all of you who generously give of yourselves <br/>\non this and other forums.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenny<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] &quot;I wish I had known...&quot;","postDate":"1108154676","msgId":103336,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMxRjFFQjAwLjJFRUE3OEVBLjBDOEQ0NUE4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103335,"nextInTopic":103349,"prevInTime":103335,"nextInTime":103337,"topicId":103324,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I’ve also been going to a local attachment parenting group with my husband Joe, so we re feeling very supported in our decisions these days.  :-D -=- I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2023604390\">-=-Ive also been going to a local<br/>\nattachment parenting group with my husband Joe, so we&#39;re feeling very<br/>\nsupported in our decisions these days.  :-D<br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI never knew until VERY lately (last week or so &lt;g&gt;)that there was such a thing as &quot;attachment parenting groups&quot; other than the mentions it gets at La Leche League meetings and in conjunction with other things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I heard was not encouraging, either.
