New thread??  My husband and I are talking about him working less<br/>\nand I<br/>\nreally feel it would be great (long overdue) and I also think the whole<br/>\nhsing/unschooling going on at home is part of that &quot;simplifying my life&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nattitude which I seem to be creeping up on.  Everybody else already<br/>\nBTDT??&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re trying to simplify.  It doesn&#39;t require my husband working less<br/>\nbut does require us moving back into our old house (which we&#39;ve had<br/>\nrented for the past five years) back into the city and not having to<br/>\ndrive 45 minutes to get to everywhere.  We will have added two more kids<br/>\nby then (our 6th is due in July) and it will be 1000 sq. ft less than<br/>\nwhat we have now.  Our idea of &quot;living in the country&quot; and keeping it<br/>\nsimply just didn&#39;t pan out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe currently have the house we&#39;re living in now up for sale and have had<br/>\nlots of calls (we&#39;re selling on our own) but only 4 lookers.  But, it<br/>\nhasn&#39;t even been two weeks yet.  The best news is after we move, the<br/>\nhouse we move back into will be paid off!<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my point is, we could have sold both, bought a big fancy house<br/>\nin the &#39;burbs and been strapped for mortgage, but instead choose to live<br/>\nin a smaller space and make do.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of our vehicles are over 130,000 miles and are 1987 and 1988<br/>\nmodels, we joke that after we move maybe my husband can buy a new one<br/>\nthat will be a 1990!  (But, hey both are paid off.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6250,"nextTopicId":6400}}
