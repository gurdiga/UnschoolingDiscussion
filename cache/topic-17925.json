But nothing beats meeting people<br/>\nand getting face to face support and encouragement.<br/>\nI&#39;d send her to homeschool groups and introduce her to<br/>\nother homeschoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Michigan is a piece of cake to homeschool in for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>now.  We want to keep <br/>\nit<br/>\nthat way!  For those in Michigan that haven&#39;t seen<br/>\nthis yet read the<br/>\nfollowing:&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWow, that was an eye-opener! When my son was still in<br/>\nschool, he took the 5th grade MEAP at age 8 (because<br/>\nhe&#39;d skipped grades) and did well enough to get a<br/>\ncommendation from the governor. Whoop dee doo. I tell<br/>\nyou all this not to brag but to assure you the MEAP<br/>\nisn&#39;t all that hard a test. HOWEVER! Whether or not<br/>\nhomeschooled kids will do well on the MEAP is not the<br/>\nproblem. The problem is having to do something so<br/>\nridiculous. Here&#39;s the thing: each school in Michigan<br/>\ngets state funds based on HOW WELL THEY&#39;RE DOING on<br/>\nthe MEAP. Isn&#39;t that awful? Anyway, what this document<br/>\nsays is they want to have homeschooled kids&#39; MEAP<br/>\nscores included in each district&#39;s batch of scores.<br/>\nThat&#39;s scary to me beyond the loss of freedom. It<br/>\nseems like a) they want to cash in (literally) on the<br/>\nsuccess of homeschooling. Ah, homeschooling success<br/>\nfunding public schools! How ironic! And b)<br/>\nhomeschooled kids who *don&#39;t* do well are going to get<br/>\na LOT of hassle, just as kids who don&#39;t do well in<br/>\nschool do. In high school in this state, you take<br/>\nthose tests over and over and over and over until you<br/>\ndo well. More irony: wouldn&#39;t you *think* that kids<br/>\nwho weren&#39;t doing well should be spending their time<br/>\nin class instead of repeating the tests? ARGH! So<br/>\ncompletely messed up....<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I told her my kids don&#39;t go to school.

My daughter took it literally and said yes.<br/>\nThe woman said, &quot;You ARE?&quot; and stared at me. I didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow what to say so I just smiled. <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to say we homeschooled, because that&#39;s well<br/>\nunderstood in our area. But now I just say they don&#39;t<br/>\ngo to school. And recently someone questioned why not <br/>\nand I said my kids were autodidacts. The person didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow what that meant and looked at them with pity. She<br/>\nasked more questions that made me realize she thought<br/>\nI meant they were AUTISTIC. :) We got that<br/>\nmisunderstanding straightened out and the woman asked<br/>\nmy daughter what she likes to study. My daughter said,<br/>\n&quot;Right now I like to study ancient Egypt and zoology.&quot;<br/>\nHee hee! That shut the woman up! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what if she&#39;d said she likes to study Archie comic<br/>\nbooks and old Star Trek videos? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do all your kids say when people ask what grade<br/>\nthey&#39;re in?
