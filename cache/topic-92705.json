Do","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1045012013\">Leonor,<br/>\nYou implied that tea is common in England, but not in the Portugeuse <br/>\nculture....interestingly enough, Portugal is the way tea made it <br/>\ninto Europe.<br/>\nDo you know your own country&#39;s history? Maybe this has nothing to do <br/>\nwith the reason you used the analogy, but it makes me question any <br/>\ninformation you write.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a paragraph from a cool website about tea:<br/>\n<br/>\nTea makes its way to Europe<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first European to personally encounter tea and write about it <br/>\nwas the Portuguese Jesuit Father Jasper de Cruz in 1560 A.D., in his <br/>\ncapacity as a missionary. After the introduction of tea into <br/>\nPortugal, they shipped tea to Lisbon; and Dutch ships transported it <br/>\nto France, Holland and the Baltic countries. Because of the travel <br/>\ncosts to ship, at that time, tea cost over $100 per pound! This made <br/>\nit the domain of the wealthy. But, by 1675 A. D., it was less <br/>\nexpensive and available in the food shops throughout Holland and <br/>\nFrance. Tea drinking became part of the way of life. Dutch inns <br/>\nprovided the first restaurant service of tea. Tavern owners <br/>\nfurnished hot portable tea sets to their guests at their garden <br/>\ntables. Into the 1700&#39;s France and Holland led Europe in the use of <br/>\ntea.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this from another site:<br/>\n As the centuries passed and trade with the West opened up, the <br/>\nstatus of tea increased. Tea was introduced to continental Europe <br/>\nduring Elizabethan times, but did not reach English shores until the <br/>\nyears 1657-1660. It was the Dutch who first brought tea to the <br/>\ncontinent. The Russians also knew about it before the English, as <br/>\ndid the Portuguese. And it was a Venetian, Gian Battista Ramusio, <br/>\nwho was the first European to write about tea. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen:<br/>\nI can&#39;t guarantee this, but I can guess that if I researched it, I <br/>\ncould find a connection to tea in virtually every country in the <br/>\nworld. Whether it was a local version or the black tea that has been <br/>\nmaking it&#39;s way through most cultures for centuries.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point?<br/>\nTea is everywhere, Portugal included.<br/>\nEverythng in the whole wide world is connected, whether you like it <br/>\nor not.<br/>\nTrying to keep violence completely out of your child&#39;s world is not <br/>\nonly impossible (it would be like hiding tea from him) it&#39;s also <br/>\ndoing him a disservice. Calm, open communication about any topic is <br/>\nfar safer than knee-jerk reactions and outright meanness (calling <br/>\nyour child&#39;s actions &quot;freaky&quot; is cruel).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as tea is all around us, so are weapons and human behavior. You <br/>\ncan&#39;t stop it, but together, you can happily learn about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92694,"nextTopicId":92707}}
