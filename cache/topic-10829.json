This is one big problem with <br/>\ntidying up in our house, I can&#39;t threaten to take stuff away, cos <br/>\nthat&#39;s what she wants me to do.  But there again I like to give <br/>\nthem the option of getting stuff out for themselves.  Tonight we <br/>\nhad to tidy the living room, cos my mum was babysitting (we went <br/>\nto see Chicken Run, very enjoyable &lt;g&gt;) and she&#39;s fat and can&#39;t <br/>\nwalk so well, so the floor had to be clear.  It got done, though dh <br/>\nstarted on it before we&#39;d eaten tea, so the kids weren&#39;t really in <br/>\nthe mood for work...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis does seem a bit &#39;anti-Montessori&#39; if the child can&#39;t access <br/>\ntheir own stuff without coming to someone else, though it might be <br/>\nan opportunity for &#39;manners-training...&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8 Jul 2000, at 0:16, Annette Naake wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\nParenting author John Rosemond suggests that no kid <br/>\nshould have more toys \u000f<br/>\nthan he or she can put away and take care of.

I regularly box up toys and put them in the basement. For <br/>\nthe most part, no one ever asks for them, and eventually the boxes get moved <br/>\nto the parking lot of the local Goodwill. Another problem is books. I think <br/>\nyou *can* have too many books. Oour house is groaning under avalanches of <br/>\nbooks.
