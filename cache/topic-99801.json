I picked up a 24oz bottle last week for 88 cents at WalMart.   More like $4.50 a gallon, but you&#39;re right still more than twice the price of the diesel for my car, too!  And we buy a lot of catsup (I almost never eat the stuff, but dh and boys live on it!).  When the boys over-serve it -- and when don&#39;t they? -- I just scoop what&#39;s left off the plate and back into the bottle.  At least I put it in the fridge at home.  You&#39;d be amazed at how rare it is for restaurants to refrigerate catsup -- and that&#39;s after they consolidate bottles.

The only reason this<br/>\ntopic of conversation could be remotely reasonable is if you worked in the<br/>\nfood supply industry. My mother is often illogical also - and was even<br/>\nbefore her brain aneurism 2.5 years ago. Years past she used to be convinced<br/>\nthat the USSR was going to physically invade the USA at any moment and<br/>\nliterally have soldiers marching in to every town to &quot;take over&quot; running it.<br/>\nI said to her, &quot;do you realize what a huge logistical task it would be to<br/>\njust take over the daily organization of 250 million unwilling victims?&quot; She<br/>\njust wasn&#39;t thinking it through. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;After that sunk in, I had this almost uncontrolable urge to go buy the<br/>\nbig bottle of catsup, get a paperplate (at home) and joyfully empty the damn<br/>\nthing onto the plate with gusto and joy!! I thought that might be a little<br/>\nspiteful, and not sure what message it would send to Wyl, so I just relished<br/>\nthat little thought in my head for weeks!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it sounds like a kind of fun art with foodstuffs game. Whipped cream<br/>\nand puddings make fun squidgy playtoys too. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Now, she&#39;s feeling it necessary to tell me what it is we&#39;re &quot;teaching&quot;<br/>\nWyl-or what he&#39;s &quot;learning&quot;-example: when he agreed to spend the night at<br/>\ngrandma and grandad&#39;s house one night (my folks), and then, later in the<br/>\nweek, changed his mind. My mother is telling me we should &quot;force him to<br/>\nstick to his original decision&quot;, because by letting him change his mind,<br/>\nhe&#39;s learning how to &quot;manipulate people&quot;! Ummm... couldn&#39;t he be learning<br/>\nhow to make the right decision in the FIRST place? Learning to know his own<br/>\nmind? Yeah, like my mother has never changed her mind in her life... Sorry,<br/>\nall-didn&#39;t mean to get off on a rant-my mother just gets my dander up. And<br/>\nthis is just the teeny-est tip of the iceburg!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn isn&#39;t very good at holding up her end of a deal yet either. I&#39;m sure<br/>\nshe will be eventually. I expect disappointment was coloring your mother&#39;s<br/>\nreaction in that case. I hope she doesn&#39;t see it as a lost opportunity to<br/>\nget Wyl alone and fix some of the dangerous damage you are doing to him? <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother is wrong (from my point of view) about how to handle almost<br/>\neverything. She was wrong in her parenting when I was young, wrong (in the<br/>\nsense of producing sadness and anger) in many of her dealings with my<br/>\nstepfather, and she is usually wrong now on those occasions when she makes<br/>\nher parenting/marriage ideas known. Her paradigm is that it is the wife and<br/>\nmother&#39;s job to control, direct and &quot;improve&quot; the basic character of the<br/>\nhusband, child or any one else she may come into contact with. Then the<br/>\nmethods she chooses for that basically wrong endeavor are additionally just<br/>\nplain ineffective and ...wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she starts critiquing on the phone, I end the conversation at once. I<br/>\nonly see her once a year. They usually come at Christmas; this year they<br/>\ncame in September for reasons of their own that are unclear to me (my dad<br/>\nhas a lot of leeway in when he schedules his annual 4 week vacation). I<br/>\nsuspect that they are trying to manipulate us into spending Christmas with<br/>\nthem. My dh won&#39;t travel at Christmas, he has an aversion to crowds at the<br/>\nbest of times. They know this. He would travel to visit prior to or<br/>\nfollowing the actual holidays instead. We make this offer every year, but<br/>\nthe date is magical to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother has become such a fragile shadow of her former self. She mostly<br/>\nsits and just watches. When she makes criticisms I have to stop myself from<br/>\nreacting in the same vigorous manner that I used to when she was fully alert<br/>\nand competent. Sadly it seems like the part of her personality that has<br/>\nremained strongest is that which is most unpleasant. She has become<br/>\nreluctant or unable to make any simple decision - like what to order from<br/>\nthe menu. Jayn was so gentle and caring of her, helping her sit or stand,<br/>\nguiding her around obstacles, speaking in a sweet little voice. Then Mum<br/>\nwould try to show disapproval for some perfectly innocuous behavior like<br/>\njumping on a chair, by refusing to hug her goodbye. <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn didn&#39;t seem to notice. She is the most forgiving, optimistic, &quot;see the<br/>\ngood in you&quot; person I know. She will look for the good inside every<br/>\ndisappointment with the phrase &quot;Well at least we can.....&quot; She is completely<br/>\nconvinced that even past death her Grandpa Jim and Grandma Paula still love<br/>\nher, despite the fact that the former&#39;s indifference has only been exceeded<br/>\nby his late wife&#39;s vindictiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry that my mother has been reduced to her current state. When she was<br/>\nwell she still was the victim of illogical fears (like a kidnapping in<br/>\nHouston would be a reason for me never to leave the house in Los Angeles),<br/>\nbut then logic could be used to counter them, and she was much more able to<br/>\nexpress that which was good and loving and playful in her towards Jayn.<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing helpful, just some thoughts sparked.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

That&#39;s so absurd a thing <br/>\nto say at all, but to a grown woman with a son of her own? You could <br/>\nalways pack up and leave -- or bring your own condiments next time. ;)&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s where it originated... He (being 5 years old) was pouring his <br/>\nown catsup onto his plate and in my mother&#39;s opinion (and probaby my dad&#39;s, <br/>\ntoo-but he wouldn&#39;t have made a fuss) he poured too much (maybe 2 heaping <br/>\ntablespoons, max). She started in on how &quot;if he couldn&#39;t pour a reasonable amount, <br/>\nnext time he couldn&#39;t pour his own catsup, that someone else would have to pour <br/>\nit for him&quot;-I was stunned! Its smooshed tomatoes, for crying out loud! $2 a <br/>\nbottle on sale! So, I calmly and reasonably-toned, smiling gently, said, &quot;Well, <br/>\nhow about if we buy you guys&#39; next bottle of catsup?&quot; She looked daggers at me <br/>\nand got up and left the table! (Which is saying a lot for my mother, who likes <br/>\nto clean the leavings from everyone else&#39;s plates when they&#39;re full)<br/>\nSo, after we finished, I went in to where she was to appologise for offending <br/>\nher (I had no clue what the hell had offended her at the time), and explain <br/>\nthat I thought that&#39;s what her &quot;manners/criteria&quot; would demand in reparation of <br/>\nthe &quot;waste&quot; of catsup. That&#39;s when she blew her top at me (away from Wyl&#39;s <br/>\nsite and hearing) that I was undermining her authority with Wyl-especially when <br/>\nI explained the differences in our ideals-catsup is just not that important to <br/>\nme! Neither is $2!! She went into this long tirade on how sometime in the <br/>\nfuture catsup might not be so &quot;plentiful&quot; and cheap, and then what would we do?! <br/>\nGee, I don&#39;t know-deal with it when and IF it ever happens? Cripes, he&#39;s not <br/>\nstupid. Nor can I ever forsee catsup being that important to me. We usually <br/>\nonly use it at her house, once a week, anyhow.<br/>\nAfter that sunk in, I had this almost uncontrolable urge to go buy the big <br/>\nbottle of catsup, get a paperplate (at home) and joyfully empty the damn thing <br/>\nonto the plate with gusto and joy!! I thought that might be a little spiteful, <br/>\nand not sure what message it would send to Wyl, so I just relished that little <br/>\nthought in my head for weeks! :~D<br/>\nNow, she&#39;s feeling it necessary to tell me what it is we&#39;re &quot;teaching&quot; Wyl-or <br/>\nwhat he&#39;s &quot;learning&quot;-example: when he agreed to spend the night at grandma <br/>\nand grandad&#39;s house one night (my folks), and then, later in the week, changed <br/>\nhis mind. My mother is telling me we should &quot;force him to stick to his original <br/>\ndecision&quot;, because by letting him change his mind, he&#39;s learning how to <br/>\n&quot;manipulate people&quot;!

I <br/>\nnoticed the similarities between his interests, not to mention his <br/>\nappearance, and Kirby&#39;s when they were younger.  Brandon wore his <br/>\ndark brown hair long when he was seventeen, too.  He didn&#39;t have <br/>\nnear enough time to deschool highschool before feeling pressured to <br/>\njoin the world of community college in order to please his parent<br/>\n(s).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat didn&#39;t last very long, and this kid is still struggling to <br/>\nfigure out how to live the conventional life five years later.  The <br/>\nsaddest part for me is that he&#39;s decided that the military is his <br/>\nonly option now.  I asked him if he knew there was a war on... now I <br/>\nknow how my parents felt when my big brother volunteered for Vietnam <br/>\nafter dropping out of highschool.  That was the beginning of a <br/>\ndownhill spiral for the next twenty years.  Brandon also feels like <br/>\na failure, at school, at work, at family life, and we haven&#39;t been <br/>\nable to convince him otherwise.  Such a waste of good talent!  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe sees anything that doesn&#39;t promise to make him big bucks as <br/>\nnothing more than a hobby, and the army is making him all kinds of <br/>\npromises I don&#39;t expect them to keep.  Everyone in my family has <br/>\nserved in some branch of the military and not one of them came away <br/>\nfrom it better for the experience.
