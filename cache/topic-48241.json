I loved your post.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf children can&#39;t obtain their basic human needs at home, they will get them <br/>\nmet in other groups outside the home.  If they can&#39;t get their parents to <br/>\nlisten to words, maybe they will get them to read t-shirts.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf my grown friends who were forced to go to church every Sunday with their <br/>\nfamilies without any option to stay home, I can only think of two or three <br/>\nwho still go to church.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it&#39;s easier in the Bible Belt to just tell children that they WILL do <br/>\nwhat you say or else.  In less homogenous parts of the country, kids don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to go far to find people with other beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo.  There&#39;s an argument to keeping your children isolated.  That&#39;s the main <br/>\nsuspicion of many homeschooling critics, that the parents are trying to keep <br/>\ntheir kids isolated.<br/>\n<br/>\nGUESS, just guess in which group this is true?<br/>\nChristian homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong ago (ten years ago) when I was on Prodigy, the discussion was more like <br/>\na web newsgroup.  All the topics were posted where people had to go there and <br/>\nread them.  And the topics weren&#39;t separated into threads very efficiently.  <br/>\nAnd there was no separation between Christian and secular homeschooling.  <br/>\nOccasionally a Christian would say &quot;If you&#39;re not Christian what are you <br/>\ndoing on a homeschooling discussion board?&quot;  And other things.  But there was <br/>\na discussion once in which one mom said she felt strongly that she only <br/>\nwanted her children to socialize with Christian families&#39; children.   And <br/>\nanother mom came on not long after and said being Christian wasn&#39;t enough for <br/>\nher.  She wanted to know what KIND of Christians they were.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a child who feels THAT confined wants out, ANY &quot;out&quot; is considered to be <br/>\nfollowing Satan, breaking commandments, and so why just go hang around with a <br/>\nCatholic family if they can join a gang?  Because they DO have a need for <br/>\nacceptance, and according to child psychologists, to Piaget and other <br/>\nresearchers in developmental stages, they come to need the approval of others <br/>\ntheir age.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is natural for a teenager to start to leave the nest.   Too many Christian <br/>\nparents feel they have a guarantee that if they &quot;do right&quot; that their <br/>\nchildren will be obedient until they&#39;re 18 or 21 or something.  As though no <br/>\nobservations of human development apply to their Christian sons and <br/>\ndaughters, but they WILL be obedient and they WILL do what their parents say.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr what?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112038769,"authorName":"Shyrley","from":"&quot;Shyrley&quot; &lt;shyrley.williams@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: parents and their so-called rights","postDate":"1035751738","msgId":48417,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDI3MjA0NDQxLkNQTEkxMTEyNS5vdXQwMTAudmVyaXpvbi5uZXRAbWFya3Njb21wdXRlcj4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDdmLjJlNDRhNzQ3LjJhZWRhMjhiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":48412,"nextInTopic":48418,"prevInTime":48416,"nextInTime":48418,"topicId":48241,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Like<br/>\n&gt; if a child doesn&#39;t want to go to school but the state says that he is<br/>\n&gt; of &quot;compulsory age&quot;.  The parents shouldn&#39;t have to jump through all<br/>\n&gt; kinds of hoops to allow their kids to stay home.  Or if a CYS worker<br/>\n&gt; decides that a child&#39;s room is too messy and orders him to clean it or<br/>\n&gt; be removed from his home (I&#39;ve seen it happen).  Or if a child wants<br/>\n&gt; to wear his favorite shirt for 5 days in a row and someone reports him<br/>\n&gt; for that (I&#39;ve seen that happen too).  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is more about family rights vs state rights. Do things like that <br/>\nreally happen?<br/>\nWith all the child abuse that goes on you&#39;d think the state would be <br/>\ntoo busy to worry about T-shirts!!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Should a Christian family be forced to allow their child to wear a<br/>\n&gt; satanic t-shirt or hold a seance in his bedroom?  Should parents be<br/>\n&gt; forced to allow their children to have sex in their bedrooms?  Dress<br/>\n&gt; like a prostitute?  Get 666 tattooed on their foreheads?  Use drugs? <br/>\n&gt; Extreme examples, I know, but do you really think that parents<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t have any right ever to step in and say &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I<br/>\n&gt; just can&#39;t allow you to do this.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not about being &#39;forced&#39; but allowing the child to have their own <br/>\nopinions and path. If a human being chooses to do the above why <br/>\nwould other humans feel they should stop them just because they <br/>\nare related?<br/>\nIn a loving family the above situations would be discussed I&#39;m sure <br/>\nbut the final decision should rest with the person wishing to wear <br/>\nthe Satanic T-shirt, have tattoos etc. Obviously the child has <br/>\nchosen not to follow the parents religion if he or she wishes to hold <br/>\na seance. Why should the parents force their religious choices on <br/>\ntheir children? I would give my children unconditional love whatever <br/>\npath they chose. I&#39;m a pagan but if they wished to go to church, <br/>\nbecome a republican (things that are distateful to me) I would <br/>\nsupport them fully. It is their choice to make, not mine.<br/>\nTeenagers are nearly adults and are embarking on their own <br/>\njourney into the world and they should have the right to their own <br/>\ndecisions and opinions, whatever the parents choices.<br/>\nNone of the above situations would bother me in the slightest to be <br/>\nhonest although I may point out to my child that wearing a satanic <br/>\nt-shirt might lead to encounters with narrow minded bigots.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know that in an ideal world the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; parents would have seen that something was off balance way before the<br/>\n&gt; tattoo and the sex and dealt with it within the context of a loving<br/>\n&gt; relationship, but we&#39;re talking about a world that isn&#39;t ideal.  And<br/>\n&gt; in this world, do we really want to send those kids off to foster care<br/>\n&gt; because the parents grounded them to keep them from destructive<br/>\n&gt; behavior?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sheila<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I don&#39;t see the above behaviours as destructive and  also <br/>\ndoubt that in a loving family a child would feel the need to be <br/>\ndestructive and rebellious against parents.<br/>\nI was speaking to a friend in the UK yestreday who is having <br/>\nterrible problems with her 15 yo daughter.

Such as the right to choose any method of homeschooling freely and without fear. The right to choose not to vaccinate without having to put up with lectures and threats, or worse. The right to choose that your newborn baby not get gunk put in his eyes that make his all-important first day with you blurry. The right to let your young child stip and play naked under the sprinklers without worrying that CPS may take him away from you for neglect. I see a great need for parents to have these kinds of &quot;good&quot; rights. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, children need rights too, that&#39;s why I said I think parents and children&#39;s rights should be equal - neither one above the other. If a child wants to play in the sprinklers naked, the parent should allow this. If a parent needs the child to get in the car so they can go to the store, the parent has the right to have the child do so. Rights working both ways, and ideally mutual respect keeping these rights equal. <br/>\n<br/>\nGosh, I hope that made some kind of sense! <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n  But Myranda!  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Parents already have all the rights.
