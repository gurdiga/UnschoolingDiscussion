There are many health risks which may or may not <br/>\nshow up right away as a result of putting metals and dyes into your <br/>\nbody. Materials and dyes used in tattooing and body piercing are <br/>\nunregulated. Most dyes used in tattooing are not approved for cosmetic <br/>\npurposes and were produced for industrial uses such as car paint.<br/>\nSome alternative doctors have ways to test for heavy metal toxicity now <br/>\nand I know a few people who have this toxicity.<br/>\nOne way this happens is from dental fillings (metal one&#39;s). So with <br/>\ntongue piercing, when you have two dissimilar metals in your mouth you <br/>\nform a battery, and through electrogalvanism you will actually have <br/>\ncurrent floating in your mouth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis article has some more info if you&#39;re interested.<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/medicine/story/0,11381,1000389,00.html\">http://www.guardian.co.uk/medicine/story/0,11381,1000389,00.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn the interest of averting the danger,<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85929,"nextTopicId":85941}}
