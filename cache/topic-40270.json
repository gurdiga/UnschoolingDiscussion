That was the 1950s and 60s in<br/>\nNew York State. I think there were enough Jews so that it was acceptable<br/>\nto take off without anyone freaking out. They are so uptight here in FL<br/>\ntoo about days off - - I think it has to do with money from the state of<br/>\nfederal government which has requirements about attendance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best time of yeaer though was in the wintertime when it always would<br/>\nblizzard and we&#39;d get about 2 weeks off of school while they cleared all<br/>\nthe roads. IT was great - winter vacation! We were snowed in and my dad<br/>\ndressed up in his red hunting suit and went to get bread and milk from<br/>\nthe store for all our neighbors. I remember the time he fell waayy down<br/>\nin the snow off a wall that couldn&#39;t be seen, and had to struggle out<br/>\nsomehow. The snow was several feet high and covered everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40201,"nextTopicId":40240}}
