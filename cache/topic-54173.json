I am a big ol&#39; slob and my organized engineer husband is<br/>\nthe &quot;uptight&quot; one.. I don&#39;t mind a bit of clutter and dust, which used to<br/>\ndrive my mother into conniptions. I would rather have it clean, sure, but<br/>\nnot if I&#39;m the one who has to do it. Clearly, if it were a priority to me,<br/>\nI&#39;d get off my butt and clean &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n I try to stay on top of the dishes and laundry, the rest can go to Hades<br/>\nmost days.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I&#39;d be different if my mother hadn&#39;t always been nagging at<br/>\nme to clean my room or help around the house. At age 35, I choose not to<br/>\nblame it on her. It&#39;s my responsibility at this point.  I wish Dh would do<br/>\nmore, but after being married to him for nearly 13 years I have gotten<br/>\nbetter about not<br/>\nnagging him, since if simply I request once and then shut up about it, he&#39;s<br/>\nmore likely to do it.<br/>\nDs is going to be 3 next week, so it&#39;s early yet, but I think he&#39;s like his<br/>\nDad and will tend to dig in his heels under pressure.<br/>\n<br/>\nHikaru</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54169,"nextTopicId":54174}}
