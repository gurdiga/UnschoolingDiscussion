LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n(Letter one in response to &quot;what is unschooling?)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is the philosophy that a child will learn what he needs if<br/>\npresented with an environment full of opportunity to learn and the resources<br/>\nand support to do so. This does presume that not every child *needs* to<br/>\nlearn the same stuff. So you may end up with a kid who knows EVERYTHING<br/>\nabout ancient Egypt and not much about the American Revolution.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what you do get is a kid who knows HOW to learn. And, if it turns out<br/>\nthey suddenly NEED to learn about the American Revolution, they understand<br/>\nresearch and sources and stuff and can find it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also presumes that you can learn the basics through just living. And<br/>\nthrough unrestricted play. Like James doing most of his reading on Zelda.<br/>\nHe&#39;s a great reader. He just doesn&#39;t sit down with a book. And you<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t sit down and &quot;teach&quot; fractions, but your child would end up<br/>\nlearning them just fine by cooking. LOTS of fractions in cooking! -grin-<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways it&#39;s harder on the parents than a straight curriculum because<br/>\nyou sort of have to be willing to drop everything and help your child study<br/>\nfruit flies for as long as they are interested. But they really get a<br/>\nconfidence in their own knowledge because it is self motivated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for many familes it extends to other lifestyle/parenting issues. I&#39;m<br/>\nrealizing that I was always much more &quot;unschooly&quot; than not. James never had<br/>\na strict bedtime. Even when he was in school it was &quot;tenish.&quot; And now???<br/>\nIt&#39;s rare the night he&#39;s not up later than me. He watches all the tv he<br/>\nwants, plays tons of video games, eats anything he wants, etc. He has much<br/>\nmore control over his personal environment than a lot of kids I know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(note to unschooling list: having written this, I&#39;m not even sure how true<br/>\nit is.  We&#39;ll see if I get off my but enough to do anything formal.  -grin-)<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure we are going to go the full unschooling path next year. I<br/>\n*like* working with him on stuff. And sometimes he enjoys it. -grin-<br/>\nWe&#39;ll see. It&#39;s a pretty big leap, in many ways and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m ready.<br/>\nMostly because with the two little ones, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be able to do<br/>\nthat &quot;fruit fly&quot; stuff well enough. And if we have even a loose guideline<br/>\nit will help make sure James gets enough Mommy time, if nothing else.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this explains it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nsecond letter<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; It&#39;s rare the night he&#39;s not up later than me.

When you can set your own goals, work to meet them, do<br/>\nthem in the evironment you find most comfortable?<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone has their own circadian rhythm. In this family it runs from about<br/>\n10 am to about 1 am. On average. We fought for 2 years with James to get him<br/>\nto have a 9 PM bed time, when he was 1-3 years old. Then we let him stay up<br/>\na couple nights and noticed he crashed at 10:30 like clockwork. Well, gee,<br/>\nthat was simple! So we set a 10 PM bedtime and he was out with some<br/>\ncuddling. That was when he had to be up at 7 for daycare. He doesn&#39;t HAVE to<br/>\nbe up now, unless we have plans. So why set an arbitrary bedtime?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t sit down to dinner much, so the kids will eat &quot;dinner&quot; either<br/>\nbefore Joe and I or after. When THEY are hungry. It&#39;s much healthier to eat<br/>\nwhen you are hungry than to set up times for it and wait until then. In fact<br/>\nI watched just that the other day with his best friend. The rule was &quot;you<br/>\ncould have a big snack before 4 pm, a small snack after 4.&quot; So James was<br/>\nvisiting and the kids were more busy playing than snacking. 5:45 came around<br/>\nand we were packing to leave. The kid was hungry, but because dinner was<br/>\nbeing made he couldn&#39;t have a snack. He got really angry. I was told by the<br/>\nnanny that this happens every day. Well, maybe you need to move dinner up or<br/>\nlet the kid eat when HE&#39;s hungry??? When I&#39;m hungry for something just<br/>\nbefore my meal I call it an appetizer. -grin- When he was hungry for<br/>\nsomething just before dinner it&#39;s called being whiny. -no grin- It struck me<br/>\nas so nuts. I mean, my 33 year old husband forgets to eat because he&#39;s<br/>\ndeeply into something, why would I expect a 7 year old not to do the same<br/>\nthing. But when Joe does it he can eat when he remembers. Why can&#39;t a 7 year<br/>\nold?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the video games and such? So his goal right now is to beat Zelda? He<br/>\nhas to figure out what items and skills he needs to aquire and then aquire<br/>\nthem. He has to keep working at it when he might fail the first (dozen)<br/>\ntimes. He has to seek out the advice of experts to accomplish his goal. (His<br/>\ndad and the guys from work are primary, but he can find info himself on the<br/>\ninternet--including using google.) He has to be able to read and retain<br/>\ninformation in context.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of it has to do with trusting your child and modeling for him. (It&#39;s<br/>\nin the modeling that I&#39;m not so strong. -sigh-) I have to trust that just<br/>\nliving his life, doing things that he enjoys and being with family and<br/>\nfriends will expose James to the experiences that he needs to start learning<br/>\nwhat he needs for life. Then I have to be there for him and help him when he<br/>\nwants to learn more than is on the surface. So if he finds a cool tool in<br/>\nZelda and asks about it, I have to be right there to help him figure out how<br/>\nto find out more about it. But I also have to trust that sometimes, just<br/>\nplaying the game is enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd James *knows* I trust him. He knows that I am confident he will get some<br/>\nsleep, eat a meal, etc. So he has the safety to try out new sleep patterns<br/>\nand see if they make him feel better. He can skip the fancy meal I made for<br/>\nDad and me and have peanut butter sandwich later, &#39;cause I know he&#39;ll eat.<br/>\nMost unschooled teens don&#39;t go through the same kind of &quot;rebellious&quot; stage<br/>\nbecause they haven&#39;t has as many arbitrary (&quot;Your bedtime is 9PM because you<br/>\nare 9 years old&quot;) kinds of rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, now I&#39;ve really rambled enough. It&#39;s been a real philosophy switch for<br/>\nme. Or more, finding out there is a philosophy which fits my natural take on<br/>\nlife.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70556,"nextTopicId":70564}}
