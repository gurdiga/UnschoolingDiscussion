She actually went to two different<br/>\nkindergarten programs, one was a fledgling Reggio Emilia - Whole Language<br/>\n- Anti-Bias curriculum charter school on the Oakland-Berkeley border,<br/>\nwhich was a nice idea but it never quite meshed and by December it was<br/>\nclearly not working and I was also worried for her safety... so we toured<br/>\na bunch of different private schools and she ended up at a tiny <br/>\nMontessori school on the island where we lived, which was better, but<br/>\nonly marginally. By the end of the school year, I&#39;d decided to quit my<br/>\njob teaching children with emotional/behavioral disorders (the kids were<br/>\ngreat but the system was awful) and we were going to homeschool if we<br/>\nended up on welfare and on the streets... my income was our only income,<br/>\nand as a single mom I hadn&#39;t yet figured out how to make money and<br/>\nhomeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were both in on this decision, we talked about it, clearly she wasn&#39;t<br/>\nhappy. We&#39;d gone to a homeschool group back in Arizona, and some of the<br/>\nfriends we&#39;d had for years were homeschooling - and all the homeschoolers<br/>\nwe knew well were unschoolers, so when she said she wanted to homeschool<br/>\nlike Leesie and Aliyah and Annie and Joe, she meant unschooling... I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think she even knew then that some people did school-at-home.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, anyway, it sounds like you all agreed not to continue the public<br/>\nprogram. I&#39;m not sure what you were doing at home, but if you&#39;re planning<br/>\nchanges, I would definitely talk to them, instead of leaving them<br/>\nwondering where things stand. Maybe something like, &quot;Remember how last<br/>\nyear I was giving you math pages to do every day, and spelling tests, and<br/>\nall that?  I&#39;ve been thinking and learning more about how people learn,<br/>\nand one thing I&#39;ve realized is that you will learn what you need to learn<br/>\nwithout being forced to do worksheets and things. Your learning may not<br/>\nlook like school-learning, but just by living in this world and doing<br/>\nwhat interests you, you&#39;ll learn everything you need to know to be you.<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m not going to make you do that kind of stuff anymore. I&#39;ll still<br/>\nbe here if you want to work on something together, or if you need help<br/>\nwith something, but it&#39;s going to be up to you now, not me. How does that<br/>\nsound?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might also want to talk some about other kids who unschool, about<br/>\nwhat they&#39;re doing and what they&#39;ve learned, and how, so they can kind of<br/>\nsee how it all works. I would think that at least the older kids might<br/>\nworry that without schoolwork they&#39;ll be &quot;dumb&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also love to hear Karin&#39;s answer to this...<br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":36193940,"authorName":"Lewis","from":"&quot;Lewis&quot; &lt;lapin@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] unschooling question","postDate":"1024672307","msgId":38519,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE1BQkJMUEVGQUNISklJQ0NCSU1HSUVJQ0NPQUEubGFwaW5Ab2x5cGVuLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PE1BQkJMUEVGQUNISklJQ0NCSU1HQUVJQ0NPQUEubGFwaW5Ab2x5cGVuLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":38518,"nextInTopic":38521,"prevInTime":38518,"nextInTime":38520,"topicId":38461,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"oops, I meant when you began unschooling, not when you began homeschooling.....","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1605118174\">oops, I meant when you began unschooling, not when you began<br/>\nhomeschooling.....</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":36193940,"authorName":"Lewis","from":"&quot;Lewis&quot; &lt;lapin@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] unschooling question","postDate":"1024672227","msgId":38518,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE1BQkJMUEVGQUNISklJQ0NCSU1HQUVJQ0NPQUEubGFwaW5Ab2x5cGVuLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDYyMDIzMDgxMy4wMjk2MDllMEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+"},"prevInTopic":38506,"nextInTopic":38519,"prevInTime":38517,"nextInTime":38519,"topicId":38461,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Wondering what you told you kids when you began homeschooling, if it was after homeschooling/public school.

Lots of rags.  For floors and sinks and showers <br/>\nand all.   If I didn&#39;t have a washer and a dryer, I would probably use paper <br/>\ntowels more, but I just wait til I have a washer load of rags.  I sew, so I <br/>\nget more rags.
