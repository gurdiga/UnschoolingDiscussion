The book calls the<br/>\n  trousers &quot;an innovation of capital importance&quot; and &quot;indissolubly linked<br/>\n  with the use of the horse in the Steppes&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n  It is also suggested that trousers were the garb of the affluent - which<br/>\n  makes sense from the complexity of the construction in comparison to a<br/>\n  tunic type of garment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Robyn Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
