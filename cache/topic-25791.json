Armstrong, <br/>\nlong time Saline County Clerk.  The test was administered to county <br/>\ngrade-school students by his father, County Superintendent, J.W. <br/>\nArmstrong in 1895.  The test was included in a book that we <br/>\npublished, &quot;Early School Records Saline County, Kansas 1875-1915&quot; in <br/>\n1989.  The test was included in the book&#39;s &quot;Introduction&quot; merely as a <br/>\ncuriosity and to allow those who were researching their ancestors in <br/>\nSaline County to experience some of the things their ancestors would <br/>\nhave experienced during their school years. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a copy of the original.  The original was returned to the <br/>\nArmstrong family after the society had copied it.  I don&#39;t know which <br/>\nurban legends site you refer to, but I had a lengthy correspondence <br/>\nwith the &quot;snopes&quot; site last year, and sent him a copy of our copy, <br/>\nwhich is a copy of the original document (a copy with no one holding <br/>\nonto the test.) They wanted to know if I had seen the original of the <br/>\ncopy, which I had not.  However, I know members of our society who <br/>\nhave seen the original at the time it was copied, and also in a box <br/>\nin the basement of our County Courthouse.  Both J.W. and R.L. <br/>\nArmstrong have since passed away.  The original is now in the <br/>\npossession of one of their descendants.  R.L. Armstrong had several <br/>\nchildren and we have not been able to locate the original as many of <br/>\nthem no longer live in this area.  In searching the County <br/>\nCourthouse, I found references to the test in J.W. Armstrongs own <br/>\nhand in ledgers that were kept by the Superintendent, but did not <br/>\nlocate the test that was there when located in the basement.  Since <br/>\nthat time the school records have been moved from the basement to the <br/>\n2nd floor.   <br/>\n<br/>\nEven though I have not myself seen the original test (I wish I could <br/>\nsay that I had), I do know the women who saw it and copied it.  Based <br/>\non the reputation and personal relationships that I have had with <br/>\nthese women, some of whom are also now deceased, I can honestly say <br/>\nthat I believe 100% that this is a copy of the original test.  Even <br/>\nthe copy shows the age of the document.  It appears to have been <br/>\nprinted on a printing press.  Many think it could only be an <br/>\nauthentic 1895 document if it were hand-written.  We did have <br/>\nprinting presses in 1895. <br/>\n<br/>\nI put the test on our website in about 1995, again, simply as a <br/>\nresource for those researching their ancestors, as I also put some of <br/>\nour school records on the site.  It sat there quietly and without <br/>\ncomment for all this time. About 2 years ago, the controversy began.  <br/>\nLately, I have seriously thought about removing it, but stubborness, <br/>\nI guess, keeps me from doing it.  I think the test has been mis-used <br/>\nby those who would use it to point fingers at the educational <br/>\ninstitutions of today and say that students of today could not answer <br/>\nthe questions.  That may be true, I can&#39;t answer the questions, but I <br/>\nseriously doubt that students of 1895 could answer the questions that <br/>\nstudents of today find quite simple.  It&#39;s kind of like &quot;describe <br/>\nMonrovia, Hecla, Juan Fermandez and Orinoco&quot; vs. &quot;describe Iran, Iraq <br/>\nand Bosnia&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can only take a test on what you have been taught, and some of <br/>\nthe things that are in this test are no longer necessary for students <br/>\nto learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that I have helped you to put the 1895 test into it&#39;s proper <br/>\ncontext. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I can help further, please let me know. <br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely, <br/>\n<br/>\nShirley George Towner <br/>\nSmoky Valley Genealogical Society <br/>\nSalina, KS.  67401 <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., David Albert &lt;shantinik@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as an Urban Legend.
