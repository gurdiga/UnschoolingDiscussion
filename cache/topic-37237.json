I&#39;m <br/>\nmarried to Brian and have a 4.5yo son and a 2.5yo daughter. My son would be <br/>\nattending K in the fall, if he were going. We live in Toledo, OH . We belong <br/>\nto a home-preschool group, though they tend to be a lot more structured and <br/>\nwhat-curriculum-do-you-use-ABeka-of-course than I&#39;m comfortable with. I love <br/>\nfollowing my kids&#39; interests and astounded at what they learn compared to <br/>\nwhen I used to try to &quot;teach&quot; them. My son is considered &quot;very bright&quot; (their <br/>\nwords, not mine) and I&#39;m coming under a lot of pressure to send him to <br/>\nschool, especially as all his friends are now registering for K. Some of the <br/>\nstories I&#39;m hearing about K assessments and testing make my hair stand on <br/>\nend. Anyways, this list has been a great source of encouragement for me and I <br/>\nappreciate the help!<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy Kagey<br/>\nUsborne Books consultant<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ubah.com/ecommerce/default.asp?sid=Z0939&gid=462366&quot;\">http://www.ubah.com/ecommerce/default.asp?sid=Z0939&gid=462366&quot;</a>&gt;Usborne Books Online Sales&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\nWW: -40.4 lbs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37198,"nextTopicId":37265}}
