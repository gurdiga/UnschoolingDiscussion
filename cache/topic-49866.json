My sister","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1637289793\">I have a sister from my mom&#39;s first marriage and a brother from my dad&#39;s <br/>\nfirst mariage. My sister looks like my mom and my brother looks like my dad. <br/>\nMy sister lived with my parents until she was 19 and my brother lived with <br/>\nhis mom. Neither one of them are anything like me at all in no way shape or <br/>\nform. Aside from looks, I don&#39;t see much at all that is like either one of <br/>\nmy parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest has been raised by my husband since she was 4. He thinks of her as <br/>\nhis. She also has frequent contact with her dad. The similarities between my <br/>\ndaughter and my husband are sometimes scary. He still jokes that she really <br/>\nis his and we had a fling a long time ago!!! Of course she is like her dad <br/>\ntoo, but so many things are like my husband, most people have no clue. She <br/>\nalso looks very much like me where my other 3 kids look like my husband. <br/>\nHey, at least I got one that resembles me!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 2 months FREE* <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49861,"nextTopicId":49869}}
