She fell in love with them<br/>\nand so did I.  It has been something we have done together.  I feed and milk<br/>\nin the mornings because my daughter likes to sleep late and she feeds them<br/>\nin the evenings.  As part of the 4-H project, she shows the goats in shows,<br/>\nearns hundreds of dollars competing against other youth throughout the<br/>\nstate.  In my mind, it would be cheating if I took care of the goats and the<br/>\nkids competed in contests against other kids.  The entire point is the kids<br/>\nare supposed to do it.<br/>\n################<br/>\nI understand that the point of the contests (I&#39;m assuming 4-H or some other <br/>\ncounty/state type ag. thing) is to introduce, educate, and allow for ownership <br/>\nand all its rewards. But you have this agreement with your daughter where she <br/>\nis sleeping in and you are doing things for her that allow her to have show <br/>\nquality goats where she wins awards, ribbons and money, based on what she does, <br/>\nyet you are doing some of the work. You said it yourself that the point is <br/>\nthat the kids are supposed to do it. Why then the push for your son to do just <br/>\nthe opposite to get the same gratification as his sister?<br/>\n################<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZach wanted to go to get the money.  He begged to show animals.  I was<br/>\nunsure that he was ready for the responsibility but he was sure he was.  So<br/>\nwe got the goat.  She is not a good milker, not a particularly good breed<br/>\ndoe.  She does cost a fair amount to feed each month.  Zach loved the money<br/>\nand ribbons.  Got to where he didn&#39;t want to go out to feed her.  I already<br/>\ndid all the cleaning of stalls, hoof care, etc..  Zach was well aware of<br/>\nwhat was involved because his sister and I had had goats for several years.<br/>\n#################<br/>\nIf the goat isn&#39;t a good addition then why not sell her and buy another that <br/>\nwould be? If your son is aware of the time and energy it takes to care for the <br/>\ngoat, yet still doesn&#39;t then why not sell? But if he is aware of all of the <br/>\nabove, yet you help his sister but expect him to go at it &quot;all by himself&quot; <br/>\nbecause of the above point, then I don&#39;t get it. Why help his sister and not him? <br/>\nWhy does she get to reap the rewards and get to sleep in and he doesn&#39;t?<br/>\n#################<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo after talking with Zach, where he repeatedly agreed that he should<br/>\npartake in Belle&#39;s care if he wanted to win contests based on his care of<br/>\nher, he repeatedly would stall, whine, etc. about feeding her.  So we talked<br/>\nand I took over all of her care and Zach quit participating in the contests.<br/>\n##################<br/>\nIf I were a child, I would stall and whine too if someone else was getting <br/>\nthe better deal too. His sister gets to sleep in, he is expected to care for the <br/>\ngoat. You state that you do all the hoof care and grooming for your <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s and your goats, but you expect him to follow standards other than that. She <br/>\ngets to take the animals to fair&#39;s and brings home awards and money for work <br/>\nyou have done and he doesn&#39;t. Exactly how fair is that? <br/>\n##################<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThen Adriane came home with some big money and Zach was all ready to show<br/>\ngoats again.  I attempted to talk him out of it, reminding him of how he<br/>\nenjoyed the money but not the work.  He repeatedly said that he was now<br/>\nready.  So Belle was returned to his care and to his credit, Zach has done<br/>\nwell.  No complaining.<br/>\n#################<br/>\nThen if there is no complaining, what exactly is the problem?

It&#39;s not something I would choose to take on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is no different than if your son was taking piano lessons and he never<br/>\nwanted to go to his lessons or to touch the piano.  I doubt you would want<br/>\nto keep paying the teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;averyschmidt&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patti.schmidt2@...\">patti.schmidt2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 11, 2003 5:56 PM<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: responsibility etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If I reminded him to feed the goat that he begged me for and is<br/>\n&gt; getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ribbons and money from youth contests who believe that he is<br/>\n&gt; taking care of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it, not me, he would need a reason or an alternate plan.

I pictured a chore<br/>\n&gt; chart and kids with regular required chores that had to get done or<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;d say, &quot;Nope, you didn&#39;t empty all the trash cans this morning so<br/>\n&gt; now I don&#39;t have time to read you a story.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Its hard to know how others will &quot;picture&quot; what we describe - we KNOW<br/>\n&gt; what we mean and we assume that we&#39;re describing it accurately, but we<br/>\n&gt; all see it through the lens of our own experience and what we see<br/>\n&gt; around us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The people around here whose kids have required chores are not talking<br/>\n&gt; about mom saying, &quot;Sweetie, I&#39;m running out of time and I really want<br/>\n&gt; the dishwasher unloaded and reloaded so that we&#39;ll have clean dishes<br/>\n&gt; later when we get home, so could you please get that done before it is<br/>\n&gt; time for us to get going to 4H and soccer today?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t have any sort of philosophical problem, like some people do<br/>\n&gt; here, of expecting kids to help out, and help out in increasing amounts<br/>\n&gt; as they get older. I have problems with inflexibility and putting a<br/>\n&gt; house&#39;s needs before their needs and all that. And circumstances<br/>\n&gt; determine a lot of how much help I&#39;d expect - when my then-16 and 17 yo<br/>\n&gt; was going to college almost full time and working almost full time, I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t expect ANY housework out of her and I just cleaned up after her,<br/>\n&gt; resigned to the fact that she was not going to get to it (not joyfully<br/>\n&gt; - I am NOT there and that&#39;s probably my downfall).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But, as much as I love my children, and I REALLY do, I&#39;m not THAT crazy<br/>\n&gt; about some of the things I do for them - like sitting at the horse<br/>\n&gt; stables for several hours, several times per week, while my 12 yo has<br/>\n&gt; an absolute BLAST grooming and training and riding, etc. I do it for<br/>\n&gt; her. I am with Julie in the sense that I see nothing wrong with<br/>\n&gt; expecting some helping out in return. I could do a LOT less for my kids<br/>\n&gt; and still be doing a whole lot more than most parents and I think maybe<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s what Julie is thinking, too?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My kids are reasonably willing to help. They know I don&#39;t expect them<br/>\n&gt; to jump up and help the instant I ask and they know that I just LOVE it<br/>\n&gt; when they do something without even being asked (nothing warms my heart<br/>\n&gt; more than hearing dishes being done when I have no idea who has decided<br/>\n&gt; to do them &lt;G&gt;). They would definitely like the house to be more<br/>\n&gt; orderly - they&#39;re at least as tired as I am of it being such a mess. So<br/>\n&gt; - maybe its good I let it get this bad - they BELIEVE it that it can<br/>\n&gt; happen and maybe won&#39;t want to let it happen again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt; National Home Education Network<br/>\n&gt; &lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Serving the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\n&gt; through information, networking and public relations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

I pictured a chore <br/>\nchart and kids with regular required chores that had to get done or <br/>\nyou&#39;d say, &quot;Nope, you didn&#39;t empty all the trash cans this morning so <br/>\nnow I don&#39;t have time to read you a story.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIts hard to know how others will &quot;picture&quot; what we describe - we KNOW <br/>\nwhat we mean and we assume that we&#39;re describing it accurately, but we <br/>\nall see it through the lens of our own experience and what we see <br/>\naround us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people around here whose kids have required chores are not talking <br/>\nabout mom saying, &quot;Sweetie, I&#39;m running out of time and I really want <br/>\nthe dishwasher unloaded and reloaded so that we&#39;ll have clean dishes <br/>\nlater when we get home, so could you please get that done before it is <br/>\ntime for us to get going to 4H and soccer today?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have any sort of philosophical problem, like some people do <br/>\nhere, of expecting kids to help out, and help out in increasing amounts <br/>\nas they get older. I have problems with inflexibility and putting a <br/>\nhouse&#39;s needs before their needs and all that. And circumstances <br/>\ndetermine a lot of how much help I&#39;d expect - when my then-16 and 17 yo <br/>\nwas going to college almost full time and working almost full time, I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t expect ANY housework out of her and I just cleaned up after her, <br/>\nresigned to the fact that she was not going to get to it (not joyfully <br/>\n- I am NOT there and that&#39;s probably my downfall).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, as much as I love my children, and I REALLY do, I&#39;m not THAT crazy <br/>\nabout some of the things I do for them - like sitting at the horse <br/>\nstables for several hours, several times per week, while my 12 yo has <br/>\nan absolute BLAST grooming and training and riding, etc. I do it for <br/>\nher. I am with Julie in the sense that I see nothing wrong with <br/>\nexpecting some helping out in return. I could do a LOT less for my kids <br/>\nand still be doing a whole lot more than most parents and I think maybe <br/>\nthat&#39;s what Julie is thinking, too?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are reasonably willing to help. They know I don&#39;t expect them <br/>\nto jump up and help the instant I ask and they know that I just LOVE it <br/>\nwhen they do something without even being asked (nothing warms my heart <br/>\nmore than hearing dishes being done when I have no idea who has decided <br/>\nto do them &lt;G&gt;). They would definitely like the house to be more <br/>\norderly - they&#39;re at least as tired as I am of it being such a mess. So <br/>\n- maybe its good I let it get this bad - they BELIEVE it that it can <br/>\nhappen and maybe won&#39;t want to let it happen again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"echomygecko","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Quoting styles","postDate":"1068587663","msgId":84516,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU2LjQxYzA2MGRiLjJjZTJiNDhmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":84514,"nextInTopic":84517,"prevInTime":84515,"nextInTime":84517,"topicId":84423,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/11/03 03:47:14 PM Central Standard Time, tuckervill2@aol.com writes: Oh.

Not because it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t need it but because I&#39;ve been busy doing other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou seem to be under the assumption that I have lots of time and the house<br/>\nis in top-notch shape and I clean house just to fill empty space or to live<br/>\nup to some Good Housekeeping standard.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat isn&#39;t the case.  This is a typical day at our house.  I got up at 6:00<br/>\nthis morning, talked to Danny (5) briefly.  I fed and milked 13 goats, I<br/>\npackaged the milk for the &quot;failure to thrive&quot; baby that drinks it, I fixed<br/>\nbreakfast for 4 kids, took a shower and fixed breakfast for myself and am<br/>\nchecking emails while I&#39;m eating.  I will then go clean the kitchen, feed<br/>\nthe dogs, cat, deer and birds.  I will stop by the vets and pick up our dog<br/>\nthat died over the weekend.  We will have a ceremony to bury him.  I will<br/>\nfix lunch and we will head to park day.  I will have to make sure that we<br/>\nleave by 2:00 because Michelle&#39;s gymnastics class starts at 2:45.  I will<br/>\ntake her then run by the feed store to pick up goat feed.  Then I will run<br/>\nby the house, pick up Danny for his gymnastics class at 3:30.  I will be<br/>\nback at 4:30 to pick him up and drop Adriane off.  Then I will start dinner.<br/>\nWhile I cook, I will ask the kids to make a sweep through the house to pick<br/>\nup their stuff because it is now difficult to even walk through the living<br/>\nroom or any of the upstairs.  Clothes, toys, papers, blankets, toothbrushes,<br/>\netc. litter the floor of our home everyday.  Not sometimes, not in a couple<br/>\nof rooms, but throughout the house.  We have tried lots of systems, such as<br/>\nme helping in each room, whatever, but each system seems to take longer than<br/>\nthe one before it.  Dinner is late, kids are hungry, people are grumpy<br/>\nbecause they can&#39;t find their stuff or worse, somebody stepped on it and<br/>\nbroke it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have lots of kids, they have lots of activities and interests and stuff,<br/>\nthey have little &quot;organization&quot;, I have only so many hours in a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou really seem to think that I&#39;m talking about a little clutter......a<br/>\nlittle clutter is what we consider clean around here.  I&#39;m talking about the<br/>\nkids regularly trash the house to where CPS would have a fit if they stopped<br/>\nin.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is 9:15 am here.  The kids have already been riding bikes that are now in<br/>\nthe driveway behind the van and will need to be moved if we are to leave.<br/>\nThere are 3 blankets in the floor, about 20 cars in the living room, there<br/>\nare markers and colors and paper on the table and in the floor of the dining<br/>\nroom,  the pillows are off the couch for a fort, there are cake crumbs and<br/>\nchocolate smears all over the table, etc....and all but one of the kids has<br/>\nbeen up less than 2 hours and most of that was spent with breakfast.  None<br/>\nof it will be put away unless I do it or ask them to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any real suggestions, I&#39;d gladly listen.....but asking the kids<br/>\nto pick up after themselves once or twice a day so people can navigate the<br/>\nhouse and so I will have time to help them with activities and projects<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem like coersion to me....it seems like simple respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeaving my stuff out to where it interferes with the activities of others<br/>\nisn&#39;t respectful to adults or children.  If I needed dh to help me with<br/>\nsomething and he was busy I would help him with something back if he asked<br/>\nme.  Then if he did carry through and help me but I didn&#39;t carry through and<br/>\nhelp him, I wouldn&#39;t see it as coersion if he reminded me of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;pam sorooshian&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, November 10, 2003 11:07 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: responsibility etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Nov 10, 2003, at 7:14 PM, jennifer haun wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I simply posted that it isn&#39;t &quot;head games&quot; around here.

But some people are adding plain text comments at the top and<br/>\nletting the plain text email they&#39;re responding to dangle beneath. Some are<br/>\ndoing both! And it&#39;s not obvious at least to me where the new stuff is. I<br/>\nknow if I need more than a second or two to figure out what I&#39;m supposed to<br/>\nread, it&#39;s likely I&#39;m just going to skip it. (Especially since the list<br/>\noccasionally gets duplicate posts so if a couple seconds scan says duplicate<br/>\nthere isn&#39;t a reason to keep searching to make sure that it isn&#39;t.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps me the most as a reader, to have a snippet quoted from the email<br/>\nfollowed by the comment. People have already read the quoted email so they<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to see more than a bit to tell them what&#39;s prompting the comment.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it&#39;s common in business and other correspondence to include the whole<br/>\nemail or series of emails at the bottom to let someone know what you&#39;re<br/>\nresponding to.
