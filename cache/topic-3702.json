Often, when he is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2061152054\">An Obsession with Trains, an Obsession with Life<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Melanie Shimokawa<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything that comes out of my two-year-old*s mouth is about trains. <br/>\nOften, when he is just staring out into space, I ask him what*s on his<br/>\nmind.  &quot;Trains!&quot; he answers.  Of course.  He knows everything there is<br/>\nto know about Japanese trains.  He can recognize any Japanese train just<br/>\nfrom a simple picture.  When he asks me to draw trains for him, he often<br/>\nhas to correct me.  &quot;No, Mama,&quot; he says, &quot;the yellow Seibu-Shinjuku line<br/>\ntrains with the GRAY doors have TWO pantographs every OTHER car.  The<br/>\nones with the yellow doors only have ONE.&quot;  Oh, right, sorry.  (But<br/>\nthat*s pretty advanced math for a two year old.  Especially when he<br/>\ntries to figure out how many pantographs are on a certain train with a<br/>\ncertain number of cars.)  He spends a lot of time drawing trains. <br/>\nThey*re not always recognizable, but he works and works at it until he*s<br/>\ndrawn every detail he can think of.  The lines aren*t straight, and it*s<br/>\ndefinitely not to scale, but he thinks of everything.  (That*s art.)  He<br/>\nknows which trains run on which line, and where those trains run on the<br/>\nmap of Japan we have up in his room.  (That*s geography.)  He is<br/>\nlearning to read the names of the trains in his books we have bought<br/>\nhim, and the ones he checks out of the library.  (That*s reading.)  The<br/>\nother day was the last day for the 0 kei shinkansen kodama train, and we<br/>\nread together in the newspaper about it.  Clipped it out, and put it up<br/>\non his wall.  He learned when it first ran, and that it was the fastest<br/>\ntrain in the world at the time.  (That*s history.)  Whenever we ride the<br/>\ntrains, he tells everybody which train they*re riding and everything he<br/>\nknows about the train.  (Field trips!)  He has lengthy conversations<br/>\nwith the train conductor on coffee break or anybody else who*s willing<br/>\nto listen all about the various trains he*s ridden, and the trains<br/>\nothers have ridden.  (That*s socialization.  Did I miss anything?)  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe*s only two, and I*m not worried about his future right now.  Neither<br/>\nis he.  He*s having too much fun in the present.<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, and other essays can be found on my incomplete website:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Pointe/3440/\">http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Pointe/3440/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone else is willing to help me by writing essays on various<br/>\ntopics, I would appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove, Melanie in Japan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3692,"nextTopicId":3700}}
