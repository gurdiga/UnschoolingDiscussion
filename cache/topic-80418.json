I will buy the book, as my youngest son is <br/>\nAutistic.....I cannot imagine a read, the way he thinks.....lol. I decided to homeschool, <br/>\npartly because of the torture school put him thru, he was so angry, not that I <br/>\nlet him BE...it&#39;s amazing how quickly he is learning and picking up new words, <br/>\netc.  Even if some of them are cuss words, we can&#39;t help but <br/>\nsmile.........they are WORDS!  I bought a leap pad for him, and since it incorporates all the <br/>\nsenses (except smell) he absolutely loves it, and I am quietly sitting by, <br/>\nokay I&#39;m lurking.....as he shows me he knows way more than I ever dreamed he did. <br/>\n I will find the book this weekend.  <br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80357,"nextTopicId":80395}}
