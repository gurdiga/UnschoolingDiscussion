Last month I ran the wrong ad for one <br/>\nof my advertisers, Headsprout Reading (http://www.headsprout.com). <br/>\nUnfortunately, the ad misled subscribers into thinking Headsprout&#39;s <br/>\nentire reading program is free at their website. It&#39;s not free <br/>\n(because they spent $5 million developing it and they can&#39;t afford to <br/>\ngive it away!), but they are generously offering 5 free lessons so <br/>\nyou can try the program before you buy it. That&#39;s more than enough to <br/>\nensure you&#39;re buying a high quality reading program, which actually <br/>\nadapts to your child&#39;s needs as your child uses it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what one of our own subscribers, Ruthie Chatton, had to say <br/>\nabout using Headsprout: &quot;We loved Headsprout. More importantly, when <br/>\nasked if reading was hard, my son responded, &#39;No, reading is easy!&#39; I <br/>\nthink that in itself says the most for your program. I felt it was <br/>\nvery effective in teaching my son to read, plus the reinforcement has <br/>\ngiven him confidence....I am so impressed! It&#39;s a great program that <br/>\nmakes something thought as one of the hardest things to master <br/>\nincredibly fun and easy. I tell other parents how enjoyable the <br/>\nprogram is and then have my son show them how well it worked.&quot; You <br/>\ncan read more testimonials at http://www.headsprout.com/testimonials<br/>\n<br/>\nSo please take a look at Headsprout&#39;s website. You&#39;ll be glad you did <br/>\nand maybe I can get off this hook! ~CN~<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>\n<br/>\nFor learning to take place with any kind of efficiency students must <br/>\nbe motivated. To be motivated, they must become interested. And they <br/>\nbecome interested when they are actively working on projects which <br/>\nthey can relate to their values and goals in life.<br/>\n~ Gus Tuberville, president of William Penn College ~<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>\n<br/>\nFROGS<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;One of my most memorable activities as a kid was watching one of <br/>\nMother Nature&#39;s most amazing transformations: the development of a <br/>\ntadpole into a frog. I remember being absolutely thrilled as the hind <br/>\nlegs began to emerge from the tadpoles. Next, the forelegs slowly <br/>\ngrew while at the same time the tadpole&#39;s tail started disappearing! <br/>\nThis was a rather slow process as it takes about 2 to 3 months for <br/>\nthe tadpole to develop completely in to a frog. Even at this slow <br/>\npace, it was exciting to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can scoop up some tadpoles from a pond, make them at home in an <br/>\naquarium and watch their development. Or you can buy a frog hatchery <br/>\nfrom a place such as Insect Lore. This hatchery includes a <br/>\ncertificate for live from embryos so you can watch the tiny embryos <br/>\nchange into tadpoles and then see the tadpoles develop into frogs.&quot; ~ <br/>\nExcerpt from Ponds and Marshes and Swamps.

My <br/>\nanimal-loving daughter was repulsed with the idea of even a virtual <br/>\ndissection, but she soon took over the mouse after I started cutting <br/>\naway with the virtual scalpel. This site has links to other virtual <br/>\ndissections as well. I can&#39;t quite bring myself to try the cat yet, <br/>\nbut virtual dissection certainly beats the smell of formaldehyde and <br/>\nthe feel of frog guts.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>\n<br/>\nASK CAROL<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery other month, I ask people to send me questions, and I promise <br/>\nto answer as many as I can in future columns. Although I don&#39;t answer <br/>\nthem in this newsletter, I do answer them in every issue of Home <br/>\nEducation Magazine, the original print version where homeschoolers <br/>\nhave found support for over 20 years. A couple of them are online <br/>\n(http://www.home-ed-magazine.com), but most of them you have to read <br/>\nin the magazine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like to get your questions-any questions at all, even if you <br/>\nthink your question is too stupid and you&#39;re the only one who has <br/>\nyour particular problem (probably not true). So, don&#39;t be shy; don&#39;t <br/>\nprocrastinate; send me your questions. I even have a special email <br/>\naddress: askcarol@... . Of course, I don&#39;t promise I <br/>\ncan answer every question in the magazine (especially if you don&#39;t <br/>\nsend one!), but I try to respond to each one, whether I use it for a <br/>\ncolumn or not.

And it isn&#39;t easily described by a list <br/>\nlike schooling is - it isn&#39;t an alternative method of schooling like <br/>\ndoing unit studies is, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes time to read about unschooling and really &#39;grok&#39; it - it <br/>\ntakes reading LOTS of people&#39;s anecdotes and reading their <br/>\nphilosophies and how they apply it in their lives and thinking about <br/>\nhow that philosophy might apply in your own family&#39;s life while <br/>\nunderstanding that it will LOOK really different in your family, even <br/>\nif the underlying principles are the same.&quot; ~ Pam Sorooshian in a <br/>\nconversation on the Unschooling-dotcom email list. ~<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling.com offers a free monthly newsletter, message boards, an <br/>\nemail list and more just for unschoolers.

You&#39;ll find the <br/>\nusual resources, freebies and information on Virginia law, but they <br/>\nalso share a number of excellent commentaries on homeschool politics <br/>\nand how-to articles on contacting state legislatures and finding a <br/>\nhomeschool group. It&#39;s a site worth looking at even if you don&#39;t live <br/>\nin Virginia.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>\n<br/>\nCOLLEGE ACCEPTANCE<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There exists a myth that the only way for a young person to be <br/>\naccepted into college is through building a record for compliant <br/>\nbehavior in a secondary educational institution. This myth was <br/>\nexposed for many of us when David and Micki Colfax wrote about their <br/>\nboys being accepted into Harvard on the strength of their own efforts <br/>\nand on the lives that they had put together for themselves, as <br/>\ndescribed in Homeschooling for Excellence.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen David Illingworth, senior admissions officer at Harvard, spoke <br/>\nto Maine families attending our statewide home education conference <br/>\nsome years ago, he assured them that even Harvard does not require a <br/>\nhigh school diploma for admission to a degree program. He suggested <br/>\nthat Harvard was more interested in the lives of home educated kids <br/>\nand in how they presented themselves than in whether or not they had <br/>\nhigh school diplomas, documents which are not extremely rare.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then we have read many accounts of young men and women being <br/>\naccepted into colleges and universities on the strength of their <br/>\nindependent learning and the interesting and productive lives they <br/>\nhave led. We are accustomed to seeing letters in the home education <br/>\nmedia from admissions officers encouraging home educated kids to <br/>\napply to their colleges. In fact, as more than one admissions officer <br/>\nhas stated, all else being equal, many colleges tend to choose <br/>\nhomeschooled kids for their motivation and for the diversity that <br/>\nthey bring to the campus community.&quot; ~ Excerpt from Earl Stevens&#39; <br/>\narticle &quot;The Door is Open ~<br/>\n<br/>\nAs graduation rolls around, homeschoolers field more questions about <br/>\nwhether our children will be able to go to college some day.

The Amazing Picture Machine searches the <br/>\nInternet for links to pictures based on a keyword. For instance, if <br/>\nyou input the word &quot;horse,&quot; you&#39;ll get a list of 18 choices from an <br/>\nold fire engine to a Peter Paul Reubens painting to a wild mustang. I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get an overwhelming number of choices for most of the words I <br/>\ntried; &quot;frog&quot; gave me 7 and &quot;tree&quot; gave me 81.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can think of all kinds of ways to use this website. When my artist <br/>\ndaughter wants a picture of a particular object, animal or person to <br/>\ndraw, she can use this site to get several examples and perspectives. <br/>\nI even set the tree frog as wallpaper on my desktop. ) To change your <br/>\nwallpaper on a PC, let the picture fully load, right click your mouse <br/>\nand choose &quot;set as wallpaper.&quot;) Bookmark this site.
