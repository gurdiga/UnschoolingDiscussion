Mason, and about drawing.  I believe that my <br/>\nson will develop more interest in it as time goes by; but I&#39;m sure you are <br/>\nright about exposing him to a lot of drawing to help inspire him.  I also <br/>\nagree that boys are,in general, a bit later in mastering the fine motor <br/>\nskills.  My son does like to take pictures, and likes to glue things, so <br/>\nthese areas are where we could start.  My other kids are 3 and 6 mos.; my 3yr <br/>\nold will enjoy gluing in a nature book, I&#39;m sure.  I found the site on C. <br/>\nMason-- it looks like there is alot of choices and even volumes to select <br/>\nfrom.  I will start with a C. M. Education, and take it from there.

I do<br/>\nsome home/unschooling and employ some of Charlotte<br/>\nMason in our week. I read alot to my DD&#39;s then I ask<br/>\nthem to take turns telling me the story I just read.<br/>\nThis tell me if they comprehend what they&#39;ve read. We<br/>\nwill also do some dictation from a book we are<br/>\nreading. I will usually only ask that they write one<br/>\nparagraph. Sometimes I will let them copy from the<br/>\nbook instead of me dictating. We are trying to<br/>\nremember to use our Nature Journals when we walk.If<br/>\nyour son doesn&#39;t like to draw let him find things to<br/>\npaste into his journal that he finds on your walks or<br/>\nmaybe he could dictate to you what he saw on these<br/>\nwalks and you could write it for him. If you are using<br/>\na journal it may inspire him one day. Type in<br/>\nCharlotte Mason in your search engine to find links.<br/>\nOne link has her list of &quot;twaddle-free&quot; books. Let me<br/>\nknow if you can not find it. Good luck and have fun!<br/>\nJill<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HPaulson5@...\">HPaulson5@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hello everyone,                                     <br/>\n&gt;                            <br/>\n&gt;             I am relatively new to unschooling;  I<br/>\n&gt; have been reading on it as <br/>\n&gt; well as homeschooling for over a year now.  Recently<br/>\n&gt; I read an article <br/>\n&gt; praising the Charlotte Mason method.  I am<br/>\n&gt; interested in learning more about <br/>\n&gt; this, and I was wondering if anyone uses her<br/>\n&gt; techniques, and what your <br/>\n&gt; thoughts are about it.  One thing I have heard about<br/>\n&gt; is a nature journal that <br/>\n&gt; the kids would draw in-- my oldest son (5 yrs)<br/>\n&gt; really does not like to draw <br/>\n&gt; very much, at least he does not spontaneously choose<br/>\n&gt; to sit and draw very <br/>\n&gt; often.  Anyway, I would be grateful for any opinions<br/>\n&gt; you might have.
