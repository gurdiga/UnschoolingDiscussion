That&#39;s one that&#39;s here for good, I think. Otherwise, not a thing. I am totally at peace with myself, and if/when anything does come up, a few hours alone, or even a few minutes here or there, and it will be settled.

Our experience can work for you instead of against you, if you just<br/>\n  open yourself up and accept your vulnerability. We&#39;re all vulnerable.

So far, though, I haven&#39;t read one bit of parenting advice that I haven&#39;t heard/read before, at least a dozen times. These ideas are not new to me. I&#39;ve read, heard, researched, read some more, weighed, considered, sometimes tested, sometimes accepted, sometimes rejected, I think every parenting philosophy you can think of. I&#39;ve found our balance, together with the children and DH. I&#39;m happy, kids are happy, and DH is occasionally happy. Can&#39;t do anything about him though, he has to find his own happiness. <br/>\n  Myranda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1512150,"authorName":"Peggy","from":"Peggy &lt;peggy@...&gt;","profile":"margotapple","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Sigh.","postDate":"1035477601","msgId":47727,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEQjgyMjYxLjk2RDk3NUUxQGxpbm1heC5zYW8uYXJpem9uYS5lZHU+","referencesHeader":"PGFwNzhzOSs5b2psQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDAwNzAxYzI3YWU4JGJhM2E5ZDAwJDAxM2ZmZWE5QGNvbXB1dGVyPiA8M0RCNzcwNEMuRDA0N0Q2NjJAbGlubWF4LnNhby5hcml6b25hLmVkdT4gPDAxYWMwMWMyN2I2MCQ3NGNjMDYwMCQwMTNmZmVhOUBjb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":47701,"nextInTopic":47745,"prevInTime":47726,"nextInTime":47728,"topicId":47561,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

A lot of it goes into things I really don&#39;t want to discuss on a list of people that I don&#39;t know well. Yes, I&#39;ve found that my idea of unschooling is different from most posters here. I see unschooling as an educational choice, nothing more or less. All of this other about it being a way of parenting, I don&#39;t agree with. Sure, most unschoolers choose to respect their children, to give them freedom of choice in all areas, to put their rights above all else, but to me those are parenting choices, not unschooling choices. I read these posts, everyone dealing with learning to have patience with their kids, learning to let them get their anger out in other ways, learning how to talk to them so that they&#39;ll listen, and so on, and I went through all that years ago. Not as much as some people, I imagine, because I started out with many of the respect and allow philosophies to begin with. I understand, but I&#39;m already past that point. I&#39;ve already sifted through what this expert suggests and what that expert swears by. We&#39;ve already figured out what works for us and what doesn&#39;t, and we&#39;ve had our &quot;system&quot; in effect for years now. Yes, it changes as it needs to in order to fit everyone&#39;s needs, but it&#39;s still based on the same philosophies. I&#39;m not going to change years of what has worked for us and kept us all happy just because someone has an opinion that something should be done differently. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany people here keep saying things to me like &quot;how do you know if you have limits&quot;, not realizing that the limits ONLY come when there is a need for them to begin with. Re-reading some of the posts about my son and the woman in the store, I think some people are suggesting (without actually saying so) that I should have just stayed in the store and kept on shopping instead of leaving. I know from experience that that would have been the worst thing for us to do at that point. The other two would have ended up upset and crying, Brett would have kept on crying, and I would be trying to calm down 3 while trying to finish shopping and get out before the yogurt got too warm - that, combined with the rude woman and the looks I&#39;d be getting from other customers, would push my frustration level way too high to be able to deal with 3 upset kids. I know when to quit. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n <br/>\n  From: Kelli Traaseth <br/>\n  Myranda,<br/>\n  I don&#39;t know if anyone has said this,  I&#39;m trying to keep up on posts but had to do some other things than sit on the computer yesterday, so ignore me if this is repetitive.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe,  this is all an age thing and what you&#39;ve been raised with thing?<br/>\n  Possibly, you have been raised in an environment that is totally different than what some of these posters see as unschooling?

Because he knows situations and sometimes answers change, and is used to going by whatever the latest answer was. Because he can&#39;t understand that someone would say something that&#39;s not true, and he&#39;s very confused. Because he is used to being able to trust any adult, and here are two that are telling him completely different things, and the person he loves and trusts is NOT the one saying the answer he wants so badly to hear.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see how you can say it&#39;s not the fault of the stranger, when she very obviously interfered in a situation that was absolutely none of her business, when very obviously no one&#39;s help was needed or wanted, and when now, days later, my son is still upset, confused, and brooding over it. Not to mention confused and hurt because he realizes that SOMEONE had to have lied to him. So when it finally gets all straightened out, I doubt he&#39;s going to trust anything he is told by others for a very, very, long time. I know I still remember the first time I was lied to by a stranger, and how much it hurt, and I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll be forgetting it any time soon. Yes, SHE caused this damage and hurt to my son with her careless words. Quit trying to blame me for it, and think about what you could be doing to a child before you step in and interfere in someone else&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can say all you want to that I shouldn&#39;t have left the store, that Brett should have still gotten the other things, and whatever else, but NOTHING changes the fact that the only thing he was hurt by was this woman&#39;s words. It doesn&#39;t matter whether or not he had a banana, sure that made it worse while in the store, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that he was lied to and is hurt. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: Mary Bianco <br/>\n  What doesn&#39;t make sense to all of us who know we have done something with at <br/>\n  least one of our children we probably shouldn&#39;t have, is that you don&#39;t want <br/>\n  to take responsibility for possibly handling a situation in the least <br/>\n  effective way. It was NOT the fault of the stranger in the store.

The point is that all we can change is<br/>\nourselves, right? This situation bothered you with that woman? Why? Your<br/>\nreaction to it and how you responded to your son have NOTHING to do with that<br/>\nwoman. Get it? It is all about you.
