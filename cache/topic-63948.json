So I guess that is what I should be working to do.

Your right there aren&#39;t too many things out there to do hands on with the dinosaurs, so Kiele and I made up our own, we made a dinosaur game using posterboard, markers, and dinosaur figures the object of the game was to get to the cave first.  We used dice and made the spaces look like dinosaur footprints, Kiele colored them in and drew some of her own dinosaurs along side of them.  I drew a volcano, some trees, a T-Rex and she colored all of this in.  On some of the spaces I marked things like chased by a T-rex go back 2 spaces, not enough food go back to start, can&#39;t find water, go back 3 and well you get the picture.  She loves it and has asked to make other games.  Another thing that we did was making our own fossils.  I bought plaster of paris (you can find it at walmart)took some sand from the sandbox , and then she pressed some of her smaller dinosaur figures into the sand to make impressions, removed the dinosaurs and filled in the impressions with the plaster of paris.  After it was dry she excavated and played &quot;Palentologist&quot; using a paintbrush to clean off all the sand, then she painted the dinosaurs.  We also did this with sea shells!
