We went (two hours) to Strasburg, PA to <br/>\n&gt; ride on the real Thomas the tank engine.  We visited the railroad <br/>\n&gt; museum of PA.  We&#39;re going on a santa train ride, we&#39;re visiting <br/>\n&gt; three other train museums.  They have every Thomas toy you could <br/>\n&gt; imagine.  We&#39;re touring an engine shed.  <br/>\n&gt;     <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sheila:<br/>\n  Us too!!  We were there for two days in June and three days in September.  <br/>\nWe&#39;re skipping the December run but plan to go back next year.  We live about <br/>\na half hour from the Steamtown museum and have been there often.  We walk to <br/>\nthe tracks every day (about two minutes away) to see if there are any boxcars <br/>\nwaiting for the engine to come and take them away.  I put my dining table in <br/>\nthe kitchen and the kitchen table (with two leaves) up in the playroom.  We <br/>\nare constantly making new setups with the tracks and buildings.  We need <br/>\nanother table and a bigger room!   Jimmy knows the names and personalities of <br/>\nall the trains he has.  We watch the videos and read the books.  After many <br/>\ndisappointing trips to the library (those books are popular!) I just started <br/>\nbuying him his own Thomas library.  We travelled to Hershey for an MRI and <br/>\nsat in the parking lot of the KFC and watched the trains coming and going.  <br/>\nWe went to ZooAmerica and his biggest thrill was the monorail going by!<br/>\n  That&#39;s what unschooling means to us.  No animals (ok, one cat, and we <br/>\ndog-sit fairly regularly), no farm, no back-to-nature good stuff, but lots <br/>\nand lots of trains!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary J<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48904,"nextTopicId":48691}}
