For a few years he was shy for anyone to see him in boxers.  <br/>\nNow he just parades around for hours, even if other people come over, in <br/>\nboxers and t-shirt.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty likes long flannel pajama pants, with pockets.  He wears jockey shorts, <br/>\nbut sleeps in those flannel pants, with or without a t-shirt, depending on <br/>\nthe season.  Then he wears the pants until he&#39;s going to go somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly is a fashion queen of some sort, and owns pajamas and gowns, but often <br/>\nsleeps in an oversized t-shirt, someone else&#39;s old favorite which she happily <br/>\nclaims for a nightshirt.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith&#39;s mom used to make the boys flannel pajamas when they were toddlers.  <br/>\nNice ones that pulled over.  The boys liked them okay, but Holly LOVED the <br/>\nhand-me-downs.  Her grandmother didn&#39;t like Holly liking those, so she would <br/>\nmake her girls&#39; pajamas, with lace (itchy) and buttons (irritating) which <br/>\nHolly never liked.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we have failed, in the eyes of my in-laws, to pajama-train our children.<br/>\nI figure they wear more pajama-like stuff (two of them, anyway) than their <br/>\nparents do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] PJs","postDate":"1045320148","msgId":58933,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkMi4yYmU1NWNmLjJiN2ZhYmQ0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58924,"nextInTopic":58960,"prevInTime":58932,"nextInTime":58934,"topicId":58921,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/15/2003 9:14:44 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...
