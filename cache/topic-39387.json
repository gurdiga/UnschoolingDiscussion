She is extremely interested in it all and it<br/>\nALWAYS asking me what a certain word says or means. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids did that.  Kirby was naming letters before he knew the answer to &quot;how <br/>\nold are you?&quot;   And in school, that would have netted him profit in grades <br/>\nand &quot;credit&quot; and praise.  But at home it was fun, and cool, but no better <br/>\nthan naming the Ninja Turtles or knowing musical instrument sounds apart.  <br/>\nAnd he came to reading in his own time, and from letters and the sounds they <br/>\nmake to fluent reading was seven years.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what&#39;s the rush?  Parents are netted profit in &quot;ooh&quot; and &quot;Well YOU sure <br/>\nknow how to teach your kids&quot; if kids read early, and some kids do break that <br/>\ncode really early on, but very many don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Marty (13) gave Julie (14?) four novels which I helped him buy used <br/>\nfrom Amazon.  A series.  He bought them with his own money for her birthday <br/>\nand then kept missing her so gave them to her on my birthday. &lt;g&gt;  She was <br/>\nTHRILLED.  Two years ago she couldn&#39;t have read them and now she&#39;s up to a <br/>\nnovel a day, but mostly uses the library in a small town.   We played <br/>\n&quot;Picture Picture,&quot; a kind of board game (we ignored the board) where you all <br/>\nlook at a picture with lots of detail and name things.  We weren&#39;t counting <br/>\nspelling, so Holly was playing too.  It was her idea, because she&#39;s watched <br/>\npeople play it for years and finally wanted to play.  Renee and Julie are two <br/>\nof the late-reading kids from the article on the front page of the library at <br/>\nwww.unschooling.com.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first round, I won.  We didn&#39;t really count and announce scores very hard <br/>\nthrough any of it But once they saw how I was doing it, naming things others <br/>\nweren&#39;t bothering to name, they picked up and I came in third of six several <br/>\nother times.  The night&#39;s big winner was Renee, who was never &quot;taught&quot; <br/>\nreading or writing or &quot;vocabulary&quot; but has always been observant and creative <br/>\nand thoughtful and there it was.  And in one round Holly won, even though she <br/>\nwrites slowly and with invented spelling.  It was because she was looking and <br/>\nthinking and not feeling she had no chance because the rest were older or in <br/>\n&quot;higher grades.&quot;  There was none of that.  It was wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":6715388,"authorName":"kevden@webtv.net","from":"kevden@...","profile":"emmasmama99","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Girls/Reading","postDate":"1027569957","msgId":39387,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTQtM0QzRjc5MjUtMTAzOEBzdG9yZWZ1bGwtMjM1OC5wdWJsaWMubGF3c29uLndlYnR2Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"VW5zY2hvb2xpbmctZG90Y29tQHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbSdzIG1lc3NhZ2Ugb2YgMjUgSnVsIDIwMDIJMDM6MzM6MjEgLTAwMDA="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39395,"prevInTime":39386,"nextInTime":39388,"topicId":39387,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Emma, who just turned 3 has already learned the sounds of the letters (actually started picking them up right around 2 years of age).
