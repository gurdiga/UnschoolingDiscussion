My daughter asked us to consider this<br/>\nbut she added that she herself is not excited about the possibility.<br/>\nThe friend is a real drain emotionally and our daughter has really<br/>\ncome to life once she was not as able to spend time with this friend.<br/>\n<br/>\n..........She is draining (very self-absorbed, obviously). She<br/>\nhas had drug use issues in the past though currently we are to assume<br/>\nthat she&#39;s not using any more.<br/>\n<br/>\n.......I can only imagine how damaged she<br/>\nis/feels. I know we can&#39;t be the ones to heal her &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a very difficult situation all around, as I think it was when you<br/>\nfirst posted about this poor lass last time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know whether she should come to your home or not, but I have some<br/>\nthoughts. I think you know this stuff already but I want to mention it<br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe may be legally an adult, but as someone who has been abused, emotionally<br/>\nshe is most likely still the needy child she was when she was first abused.<br/>\nPeople who have been hurt need some kind of therapy to &quot;grow up&quot; and become<br/>\nhealed. It took me at least 15 years after becoming 18 to do so, and I was<br/>\nmuch less abused than this girl has been.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I say therapy I mean that she will have a need to have &quot;therapeutic<br/>\nconversations&quot; with someone, whether that be a counselor of some kind (this<br/>\nis one time when being in a school may have helped her), a therapist, a<br/>\ngroup therapy either formal or informal (eg Narcotics Anonymous). In the<br/>\nabsence of this she will likely make you and your dd her &quot;therapists&quot;,<br/>\nincluding getting angry if you touch her &quot;sore points&quot; of denial, which you<br/>\nknow must exist. It is a real need, and you have noted that she is draining<br/>\nof your dd.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout actively dealing with the damage that her psyche has suffered from<br/>\nbeing abused, she will almost certainly continue to replay the negative<br/>\nrelationships she had with her parents with future romantic and even<br/>\nprofessional relationships. She will almost certainly be attracted to and<br/>\ndrawn into relationships with men who will turn out to be abusive in<br/>\nparallel and mirroring ways. And the person she will turn to in order to<br/>\nunload her misery onto would likely be your dd.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest, regardless of whether she moves in with you, that one big<br/>\nway to help her would be to find somewhere for these &quot;therapeutic<br/>\nconversations&quot; to occur. Alice Miller speaks of the concept of the &quot;witness&quot;<br/>\nto validate the child&#39;s negative feelings. Maybe there is a support group<br/>\nfor battered women nearby that she could join, or even a half way house or<br/>\nshelter. If she still has a desire to use drugs, she might find NA to be<br/>\nvery freeing. Maybe there is some kind of therapy available through CPS.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer dad had better beware. The moment she turns 18, if he hits her she can<br/>\ncall the cops and he&#39;d be charged with assault. He would probably claim that<br/>\nshe was trespassing. Her parents could probably use some serious therapy<br/>\nalso.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with it, Julie.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
