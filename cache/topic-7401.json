What<br/>\n  works, and doesn&#39;t work, for your families?**<br/>\n<br/>\n  We too have only one child and we are unschoolers. Azure is almost 13<br/>\n  (next month). We tried the regular home schooling thing, but it was<br/>\n  too confining/structured/boring for her tastes. She has never been to<br/>\n  public/private school. She loves the computer and reading. She is<br/>\n  physically active. We volunteer, a lot! She has the &quot;family zoo&quot;<br/>\n  (lots and lots of pets) to keep her busy. She is on the teen council<br/>\n  at the local library. I just recently discovered the unschooling<br/>\n  Yahoo lists (they even have one for unschooling families of only<br/>\n  children) - so we will be meeting other unschooling families soon.<br/>\n  She has been accepted into Arizona Animal Welfare League&#39;s Teen<br/>\n  Tracks program (for kids who are interested in animal science<br/>\n  careers). One of the best groups that she belongs to is the Young<br/>\n  Marines program (website ww.youngmarines.com). It is not a<br/>\n  recruitment tool for the military, rather it began as a drug demand<br/>\n  reduction program (still an important part of the program). You don&#39;t<br/>\n  have to be a military family to belong. It is sponsored by the Marine<br/>\n  Corp League. It teaches camping skills, public speaking, leadership,<br/>\n  manners, etc. They also have some really wonderful summer programs:<br/>\n  National Encampments, Leadership Schools Junior, Senior & Advanced),<br/>\n  Revolutionary War & Civil War experiences, Space Camp, Mach 1-3<br/>\n  (aviation), as well as &quot;exchange student&quot; opportunities. We love it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n___________________________________________________<br/>\nPlay 100s of games for FREE! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://games.mail.com/\">http://games.mail.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90421708,"authorName":"LsMe@aol.com","from":"LsMe@...","profile":"katielouba","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Only Child","postDate":"1035601965","msgId":48133,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4My4xMGQyMGFmNy4yYWViNjIyZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7401,"nextInTopic":111681,"prevInTime":48132,"nextInTime":48134,"topicId":7401,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1027652686\">&lt; &lt; From: &quot;moonlitbatiks&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moonlitbatiks@...\">moonlitbatiks@...</a>&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&lt; I am starting to question the value of her having lots of time with <br/>\n&lt; kids her age.

ANd I \nimagine it&nbsp;could get lonely sometimes, especially considering his friends , \nwho all go to school , also all have siblings.&nbsp;But he&#39;s always been an only \nchild so he&#39;s sort of used to it(LOL) The friends we go to visit most often, are \na big family of 5 kids, and he loves to go there, probably just for that reason. \nThere is never an under abundance of someone to play with.&nbsp; But we spend \nalot of time just the two of us, and even then he spends time alone...I&#39;ll \nlisten to him sometimes make-believing in his room, and just talking up a storm, \nas if there were 10 people in there with him.&nbsp; Since my husband , and I \nwere both only children , too, we know things turn out fine, but there are times \nwhen I know he needs more attention, and kid time, and I just try to make that \nfor him. Spend a day at a friends, or something, got&nbsp;to the park...or just \ndo something fun...fun to him is taking a walk in the woods out back.&nbsp; We \ndo have alot of animals...3 dogs 2 cats 2 birds and 3 fish...the fish aren&#39;t too \nfriendly but the dogs and cats are much like siblings.&nbsp; He is ready for \nmore responsibility, and we&#39;ve built a dog run for the youngest pup out back(TOO \nMany animals in the house!) so he will be feeding and playing with him out back \nonce we get th gate up.....I think the animals are really great. I would like to \nhave another child as well, but we&#39;ve had NO luck, and I wanted them to be close \nin age, but the longer it gets the least likely that is.&nbsp;Things tend to \nhappen when they are supposed to. </font></div>\n<div><font size=\"2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe when he&#39;s a bit more proficient with \nthe spelling the two can be pen pals or something over the net...they can talk \nabout there days, homeschool projects and the such. Just an idea.&nbsp; Well I \nthink Only children are great..they get plenty of attention, and&nbsp;&nbsp; \nhave abundant inventive, and creative skills.&nbsp; I think socialization is \nover-rated.&nbsp; You know, Me personally have found as I get older, that I \nyearn for more time just by myself to do whatever I want \nread..think...meditate...so I imagine it is the same for children..It \ncontributes to them&nbsp;knowing who they are,&nbsp;and being comfortable with \njust themselves..that&#39;s one step in being social...to know and like \nyourself....Michelle&nbsp; </font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111679,"nextTopicId":111631}}
