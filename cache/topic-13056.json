When we <br/>\nbought our condo, Zack was 3, Haley was still a year in the future.  We <br/>\nfigured we&#39;d be in it a couple of years, then move to a bigger place and rent <br/>\nthe condo out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that was before this whole homeschooling thing came up!  Now, we&#39;re a <br/>\none income family, and the condo mortgage is great!  Unfortunately, we have <br/>\nno backyard, but we do have a small enclosed patio and a pool right down the <br/>\nstreet.  I do miss the backyard, but we make do.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the thing.  Although there&#39;s an elementary school right next door, we <br/>\nhave virtually no kids in our 300 unit complex!  It&#39;s all older folks and <br/>\nsingles.  The very few families have older kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a really active support group, and we have friends over often, but I <br/>\nmiss that neighborhood I grew up in where the kids were all in each other&#39;s <br/>\nhouses every day and all weekend.  I wonder if my kids are really missing <br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friends with kids in school, who live in those neighborhoods with lots of <br/>\nfamilies, tell me that things are really different these days.  The kids are <br/>\nof course in school all day, then they have sports and other after school <br/>\nactivities and then the weekends are full of soccer and baseball games.  So <br/>\nthe kids don&#39;t really see each anyway unless they go to school together.  <br/>\nLots of my homeschool friends have noticed this too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just wonder if your kids play with kids in the neighborhood or if they&#39;ve <br/>\nexperienced the same drought of local playmates.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarron</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13064,"nextTopicId":13069}}
