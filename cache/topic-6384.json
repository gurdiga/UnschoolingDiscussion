For example, I can<br/>\nget you 160 acres with a 5 bedroom house for between $120,000 and $150,000<br/>\nup here.  Of course, if one is looking for schools, I can&#39;t tell you why<br/>\nanyone would choose CA because we are at about the bottom to the list in<br/>\nthe 50 states so the schools where she is must be really bad or is it not<br/>\nacademics that she is talking about??  The local schools always test higher<br/>\n (about 40 points higher in reading than the state average) than the state<br/>\naverage but then, where does the state test compared to other states?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if she wanted to hs, then I would say this is the place to be.  But<br/>\nthen again, maybe that is only in my neck of the woods since up here the ps<br/>\nsystem gives out info on the local hsing groups, etc.!<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ECSamHill@...\">ECSamHill@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 2/10/2000 6:33:10 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;My dad has to stay in MS because of his job, but my mom is thinking<br/>\n </span></blockquote>about <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; taking the kids (she still has four living at home) back to California <br/>\n&gt; because the<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; schools are so much better there. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; California also has many bad schools.
