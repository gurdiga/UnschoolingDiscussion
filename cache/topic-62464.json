My civic preferences say that so long as someone isn&#39;t <br/>\nhurting someone else, their tax dollar is as worthy as mine.  Personal <br/>\nfeelings are irrelevant in this case.  It has nothing to do with me <br/>\n*personally*, but everything to do with what is available in a public <br/>\nspace.  For instance, I feel upset when I read some textbooks and some <br/>\ntexts by religious-sounding persons, yet, both are available in <br/>\nlibraries.  Civically, even though they are offensive to a member of the <br/>\npublic, they should be there for the people for whom they may serve a <br/>\npurpose.

(It&#39;s time to play, &quot;Spot the Value Statement!&quot;) What one person <br/>\nvalues is not necessarily that of another person, and what is valued by the <br/>\nmajority is not always best for society as a whole.  This is something <br/>\nbasic that&#39;s been shown time and again.  That young man mentioned earlier <br/>\nis probably from a household where sexual feelings are probably repressed <br/>\nand denied, or treated as &#39;naughty&#39;... so, he goes someplace safe to <br/>\nexplore them and is self-conscious enough to want to keep others from <br/>\nprying.  Is it the healthiest thing for him to do?  Who is the person to <br/>\nsay it is or isn&#39;t for that particular young man?  Whomever says so, then <br/>\nbecomes responsible for the rest of his development as well, in my <br/>\nopinion.
