(Why did I do this?  For fun, for my own interest, <br/>\nbecause maybe I&#39;ll make a documentary or something, who knows?)  You <br/>\ncan read more of my introduction at the survey start page <br/>\n(www.xed-out.com/unschooling), and I am happy to answer questions here <br/>\non this list or privately via email.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to invite the unschooling families that read here to <br/>\nparticipate in the survey by going to the page I listed above and <br/>\nfollowing the instructions there.  Additionally, if anyone tried the <br/>\nsurvey before and couldn&#39;t get it to work, I&#39;ve re-set the answers so <br/>\nyou should be able to try again.  Best results come from using Netscape <br/>\nas your browser, and taking the survey at &quot;odd&quot; times of the day.  If <br/>\npossible, don&#39;t take the survey on a Saturday morning in any time zone! <br/>\n  I used a free service to host the data, and it gets overwhelmed if too <br/>\nmany people access it at once.  (But if there&#39;s a lot of interest in <br/>\nthe survey, next year when I run it again maybe I can get a grant to <br/>\nhave it hosted on a more robust computer.)  Last technical note:  if <br/>\nyou are RETAKING the survey due to having had problems before, please <br/>\nmake a note to that effect in the comments field at the end so that I <br/>\nwill double-check that you have not been counted twice.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s some exciting survey data so far!  Please bear in mind that the <br/>\nonly place the survey has been publicized so far was at the L&L <br/>\nConference, so at the moment the results are heavily weighted in the <br/>\ndirection of the US Northeast and South regions.<br/>\n<br/>\n38 households have taken the survey so far.<br/>\n<br/>\n100% of the households have been represented by mothers of the children.<br/>\n<br/>\n53% of the households responding so far are located in the Northeast of <br/>\nthe US.  (26% from the South)<br/>\n<br/>\n84 children are so far represented by the survey: 57 of compulsory <br/>\nschool-age, 19 not-yet-school-aged, and 8 past the age of compulsory <br/>\nschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n46% of the school-aged children have never been to school, nor schooled <br/>\nvia curriculum at home.<br/>\n<br/>\n89% of the children who are currently unschooling have unrestricted <br/>\naccess to media in their homes.<br/>\n84% of the children who are currently unschooling do not have a <br/>\nprescribed bedtime.<br/>\n46% of the children who are currently unschooling are not required to <br/>\ndo chores.<br/>\n33% of the children who are currently unschooling are also currently <br/>\ntaking a class or lessons.<br/>\n<br/>\n28% of the children who have never been to school (or had <br/>\ncurriculum-at-home) have listed &quot;reading to self&quot; as a favorite <br/>\nactivity.<br/>\n<br/>\n94% of the children not yet of school age will be unschoolers, once <br/>\nthey reach compulsory school age.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening,<br/>\nand I look forward to seeing more results come in!<br/>\n<br/>\nRegan<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingsurvey@...\">unschoolingsurvey@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100218,"nextTopicId":100121}}
