Yet learning is happening there too (maybe even <br/>\nespecially there). Do you measure how quickly and well your <br/>\nspouse/SO/best friend pick up knitting or cooking souffles or <br/>\ngardening or whatever? Does your head explode from not measuring them? <br/>\nNot likely - mostly you encourage them, maybe notice when the local <br/>\ngarden club/knitting circle/cooking school is having a special event <br/>\nand mention it to them (supporting their interest); you buy them <br/>\nmaterials and books and videos and whatever for gift occasions <br/>\nand &#39;just because&#39;. Treat your child(ren) like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs was mentioned, what do *you* want to do and be and explore? What <br/>\ndoes he want to do and be and explore? If you are active and <br/>\ninterested and exploring, you won&#39;t have time for the worries about <br/>\nwhat someone else is NOT doing - you&#39;ll be having too much fun doing <br/>\nwhat you all are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who is not willing to do their own considering and truly think <br/>\nabout things, doesn&#39;t need a big explanation - this is what we&#39;re <br/>\ndoing,it works for us, end of discussion. Answer questions politely <br/>\nbut firmly - it is not open to debate (you and your partner might have <br/>\nlong discussions - and probably should - over this *out of earshot* of <br/>\nthe kids but anyone outside your immediate household can accept it or <br/>\nshut up). We didn&#39;t even use the word &#39;unschooling&#39; for several years -<br/>\n we just answered all questions on our &#39;homeschooling&#39; from that <br/>\nperspective. Once they saw that it was a thought out decision, not <br/>\ngonna change, we got fewer and fewer questions of that sort and more <br/>\nreal discussion of the subject. Then we started using unschooling in <br/>\nreference to what we do as differentiated from the generic <br/>\nterm &#39;homeschooling&#39;. But by then the proof of the pudding was our <br/>\nloving, happy, curious, growing, interested, interesting, exploring, <br/>\ndiscovering boy. Terminology was immaterial at that point as far as <br/>\nextended family was concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:New Here with Questions","postDate":"1116444658","msgId":105981,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk2LjI3YTEwYTAxLjJmYmNmMWYyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":105963,"nextInTopic":105982,"prevInTime":105980,"nextInTime":105982,"topicId":105963,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/18/2005 5:57:23 AM Eastern Standard Time, UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com writes: If I  can t measure his learning with grades","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1218129963\">In a message dated 5/18/2005 5:57:23 AM Eastern Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I  can&#39;t &quot;measure&quot; his learning with <br/>\ngrades will my head explode:)?

It&#39;s nice.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy biggest piece of advice is to get out of the mindset that you are  <br/>\n&quot;unschooling the children.&quot; Instead, become a lifelong learning, unschooling  family. <br/>\nIs there something you always wanted to do or learn? Do you wish you&#39;d  <br/>\nlearned to play piano or scuba dive? Do you wish you could make jewelry or write  a <br/>\nnovel? Do it!  Learning and exploring is compelling, and if the kids see  you <br/>\ndo it, they&#39;ll do it too.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt might not look the same, and they may need time to get into it. And the  <br/>\nthings they do might be different from the things you do. But if the whole  <br/>\nfamily is doing really cool exciting things and talking about the amazing world  <br/>\nthey live in, family members will get into it too. When you or your child <br/>\ntalks  about the love of butterflies or playing violin, they might say &quot;I wish I <br/>\ncould  do that!&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s when you say, &quot;Do it! I&#39;ll help!&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is how we change the world.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":184369253,"authorName":"Marin","from":"&quot;Marin&quot; &lt;rinnyboo@...&gt;","profile":"rinnyboo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"New Here with Questions","postDate":"1116359836","msgId":105963,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ2ZGlhcytiZGFsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":105981,"prevInTime":105962,"nextInTime":105964,"topicId":105963,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi!
