I&#39;ve figured out lately that TV is often  <br/>\n&gt; boring and therefore my mind/body demands something &quot;more&quot; to  <br/>\n&gt; entertain it - food is a quick and easily available fix.  Better to  <br/>\n&gt; change your activity than to add food just to &quot;spic!<br/>\n&gt;  e up&quot; a boring activity. Oh and back to the mood thing - if I eat too  <br/>\n&gt; many carbs. I get those sugar highs and lows which can make me tired  <br/>\n&gt; and moody.
