There&#39;s no <br/>\ngood way to overtly not file a form.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt that MLK would encourage people to go out and announce to all their <br/>\nneighbors if they were cohabiting without marriage, or commiting adultry, or <br/>\nhave technically illegal sex.    It&#39;s one of those privacy-of-the-home matters, <br/>\nwhen a family is unschooling.   It&#39;s not a crime with a victim outside the <br/>\nhome, nor a victim inside the home.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a <br/>\nwillingness to accept the<br/>\npenalty.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems he was talking about segregation laws.   That&#39;s not parallel to <br/>\nhomeschooling vs. school, nor to registration vs. non-registration.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen so many people were living together that it would have been silly to <br/>\nhave charged one couple with the crime of cohabitation, that&#39;s when that law <br/>\nbecame silly.    When so many people&#39;s children have grown up without school and <br/>\nwithout having been registered homeschoolers that it would be silly to charge <br/>\none family with failing to register, that&#39;s when that law will become silly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no advantage to a single couple saying &quot;Guess what?   We&#39;re not <br/>\nmarried!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109267,"nextTopicId":109266}}
