Why<br/>\nnot just buy &quot;less&quot; or buy &quot;better&quot; or &quot;smarter&quot; or whatever floats your<br/>\nboat?

But I don&#39;t see this going anywhere. People like shopping.<br/>\nPeople like giving gifts. It&#39;s Christmassy. Why make it unenjoyable for the<br/>\npeople who want to shop?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you know that most actual buying is done the Saturday before Christmas?<br/>\nThe day after Thanksgiving is a great *shopping* day...it&#39;s a lot of<br/>\natmosphere...more of a holiday tradition than the buying frenzy the BND<br/>\npeople would tell us about.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is fun for you and your family, well, okay. But I&#39;ll be spending the<br/>\nsame amount as last year, a comfortable sum, nothing that would make or<br/>\nbreak the economy.

","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2083867058\">This afternoon we joined a group of around 20 other demonstrators outside<br/>\nPortland&#39;s downtown Banana Republic store (adjacent to Pioneer Courthouse<br/>\nSquare).<br/>\n<br/>\n Kory (8) carried a sign protesting the sale of animal fur.  Heidi (10)<br/>\ncreated her own slogans and signs on the spot.  Two of her slogans were:<br/>\n&quot;What is it with these holidays?  They make the shopping virus spread,&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;Live long and prosper, but don&#39;t live your life out shopping!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to attract more attention to her work, she climbed up on a lamppost<br/>\nand held her sign high for all to see.  One of the mounted police saw and<br/>\nrode over to order Heidi to come down.  That was our closest brush with the<br/>\nlaw.<br/>\n<br/>\nKory, wearing his camoulflage trousers, was easily the most vocal of all the<br/>\ndemonstrators.  He walked back and forth with his sign in hand yelling (he&#39;s<br/>\nan expert at that) &quot;Buy Nothing Day, Buy Nothing Day, Buy Nothing Day.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe others in the group loved seeing Heidi and Kory take such an active role<br/>\nin the demonstration.  I was both surprised and impressed with their<br/>\ncomplete lack of shyness and self-consciousness.  Hopefully neither of those<br/>\nthings will kick in as they get older.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy contribution was recruiting several other demonstrators to sing<br/>\nanti-consumerism carols.  We did three:  &quot;Welcome to Consumer Wonderland&quot; to<br/>\nthe tune of &quot;Winter Wonderland, &quot;Profits here, profits there, profits<br/>\neverywhere&quot; to the tune of &quot;Jingle Bells,&quot; and &quot;Slow down ye frantic<br/>\nshoppers for there&#39;s something we must say&quot; to the tune of &quot;God Rest Ye<br/>\nMerry Gentlemen.  There is a website which has the lyrics to all three of<br/>\nthese plus several other anti-consumerism carols.  You can find it at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.newdream.org/commerc/songs.html\">http://www.newdream.org/commerc/songs.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOn the way home, both children asked when we&#39;d be able to do that sort of<br/>\nthing again.  They loved it.  For the three of us, this was our very first<br/>\nstreet demonstration.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we&#39;re all looking forward to Buy Nothing Day 2001.  If you&#39;re in the<br/>\nPortland area, why not join us next year.  The more the merrier.  A bunch of<br/>\nyoung families among the demonstrators could send a powerful message to the<br/>\npublic; a message which needs to be heard.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Andersen<br/>\nUnconventional Ideas at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unconventionalideas.com\">http://www.unconventionalideas.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14227,"nextTopicId":14230}}
