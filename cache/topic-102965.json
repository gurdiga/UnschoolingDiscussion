But I agree with him about  <br/>\nthe English paper.  The teacher told him he wrote well, but that  that&#39;s not <br/>\nenough.  He was 10 points off (a whole grade) for not  underlining the thesis <br/>\nsentence, and another 10 points off because some  paragraphs were less than 100 <br/>\nwords.   So that was a C before she  even read a word.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe tuition is a loss, but just like not finishing a dozen donuts just  <br/>\nbecause you paid for them, it&#39;s better for him to suffer less and not have a D  or <br/>\nan F on a report card, and a LOT of bitter essay-writing memories than for  <br/>\nhim to wait and try another semester for a teacher he likes better.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs usual, since this school-contact began, I&#39;m suffering more emotional  <br/>\ntrauma than he is.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe first grade in his entire life, and it&#39;s a D.   That wounds  my soul, but <br/>\nhis own soul is strong and whole and seems fine!<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103747,"nextTopicId":103788}}
