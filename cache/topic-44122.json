Does she take responsibility for her actions or blame others? Does she show empathy and/or sympathy for others? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been doing a lot of research on my own son&#39;s behavior &quot;problems&quot; and have run across a lot of different things that this sounds like!!!<br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ok.  I need some help.  My just turned 6 yo daughter is a wonderful<br/>\n  little girl.  Bright, aware, kind, all the wonderful adjectives that you<br/>\n  can think of.  However, she has a whiny and explosive side that can<br/>\n  erupt in a millisecond.  It isn&#39;t always predictable and it usually<br/>\n  turns physically violent (from her!) and is almost always only in front<br/>\n  of other people.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Example:<br/>\n  We go to Brownies (where I am a co-leader).  She claims to really really<br/>\n  love Brownies and she wants to be part of the troop (she has the option<br/>\n  of quiting or not attending at any point).  We are working on an<br/>\n  interesting project (of which she is enjoying, she helps me decide what<br/>\n  it is going to be, and she is doing a fine job of it), then all of a<br/>\n  sudden she gets really mad and starts throwing things.  When I pick her<br/>\n  up (to walk her to the hall or outside to talk), she hits and kicks and<br/>\n  screams and tries to stab me with whatever object she happens to be<br/>\n  holding.  Once we get outside alone, she is often calm, but if someone<br/>\n  walks by she erupts again.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Another example:<br/>\n  In a pool, she is playing with another child close in age to her.  The<br/>\n  other child has a toy that they are playing happily with, my daughter<br/>\n  tries to grab it and the other child says, &quot;You can have it in a minute<br/>\n  when I am done, but I&#39;d like to finish this thing first.&quot;  My daughter<br/>\n  erupts, causing such a screaming outburst that I have to physically<br/>\n  restrain her until we get into a room alone so that that she doesn&#39;t<br/>\n  hurt herself, the other child, the toy, or me.  Once she is in a room in<br/>\n  the house (or in the car if we are out and about- different, but similar<br/>\n  situation), she usually gets calm unless she hears other people and<br/>\n  knows that they can hear her (then she starts beating up everything in<br/>\n  sight).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Another example:<br/>\n  We, as a family, go to another person&#39;s house.  She is forewarned that<br/>\n  we&#39;ll be there for 1 hour and she brings books, etc. to occupy her if<br/>\n  she is not enjoying being there.  We walk in the door, she is polite and<br/>\n  fine.  As soon as we start a conversation with the people in the house,<br/>\n  my daughter starts whining and screaming that she is not having any fun<br/>\n  and this is boring.  This quickly turns into her thrashing on the floor,<br/>\n  not hearing any words that come out of our mouths.  She is sometimes<br/>\n  consolable only if left completely alone with a book to read (but no one<br/>\n  dare talk to her).  The house owners usually wonder what in the world<br/>\n  they did wrong and she glared at them when we leave.  [This has happened<br/>\n  twice in the last couple of week, but we seldom go over to others<br/>\n  houses, thank goodness!  I&#39;d like to more, but I am afraid to and she is<br/>\n  too young to be left alone.  I am thinking of &quot;forcing&quot;, yes FORCING on<br/>\n  this one (help me if I am wrong) her to write (with my help) an apology<br/>\n  for her behavior to these other people who think she is a monster.  She<br/>\n  does feel sorry for her actions now, or she at least claims to, but I<br/>\n  know that she&#39;d do it again in a second.]<br/>\n<br/>\n  We&#39;ve role played these situations beforehand (with her &quot;acting&quot; just<br/>\n  fine).  We&#39;ve role reversed, too.  We&#39;ve talked and talked to no<br/>\n  effect.  I&#39;ve read all the books (&quot;Spirited Child&quot;, &quot;Explosive Child&quot;,<br/>\n  &quot;How to talk...&quot;) and tried the examples, but none the children in these<br/>\n  books are anything like my own.  I&#39;m at my wit&#39;s end.  When talking<br/>\n  after a situation, she really believes that she did nothing wrong.  She<br/>\n  knows that hitting, etc. is wrong (we don&#39;t hit her!), but feels<br/>\n  justified that she had a right to do what she did because she was mad<br/>\n  and the rest of the world was being mean to her.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Help!  My parents are here visiting right now (been here 4 days and will<br/>\n  be here 4 more) and they are acting (but not outright saying,<br/>\n  thankfully) that we are parenting her SO bad and that if only we&#39;d put<br/>\n  her in public schools that she&#39;d be shamed into not doing this<br/>\n  nonsense.  I know this isn&#39;t true, and I can make really good arguments<br/>\n  for the educational aspect of unschooling, but I can&#39;t come up with an<br/>\n  argument for the emotional/getting along with others aspect of<br/>\n  unschooling, especially when it appears as if we are failing in this<br/>\n  aspect.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  There are natural consequences for these actions:  People start not<br/>\n  liking you (including me at times!).  Have I given her too much<br/>\n  freedom?  Am I turning her into a monster?  To be completely honest, I<br/>\n  often feel like she deserves a good spanking (I&#39;ve told her that is what<br/>\n  other parents often do).  I walk away when I feel that way (she usually<br/>\n  follows!) and I know that is wrong.  My parents claim (again, with no<br/>\n  real words) that children are only violent like this if their parents<br/>\n  are violent to them!  I&#39;ve learned that this is not true.

My just turned 6 yo daughter is a wonderful<br/>\nlittle girl.  Bright, aware, kind, all the wonderful adjectives that you<br/>\ncan think of.  However, she has a whiny and explosive side that can<br/>\nerupt in a millisecond.  It isn&#39;t always predictable and it usually<br/>\nturns physically violent (from her!) and is almost always only in front<br/>\nof other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:<br/>\nWe go to Brownies (where I am a co-leader).  She claims to really really<br/>\nlove Brownies and she wants to be part of the troop (she has the option<br/>\nof quiting or not attending at any point).  We are working on an<br/>\ninteresting project (of which she is enjoying, she helps me decide what<br/>\nit is going to be, and she is doing a fine job of it), then all of a<br/>\nsudden she gets really mad and starts throwing things.  When I pick her<br/>\nup (to walk her to the hall or outside to talk), she hits and kicks and<br/>\nscreams and tries to stab me with whatever object she happens to be<br/>\nholding.  Once we get outside alone, she is often calm, but if someone<br/>\nwalks by she erupts again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example:<br/>\nIn a pool, she is playing with another child close in age to her.  The<br/>\nother child has a toy that they are playing happily with, my daughter<br/>\ntries to grab it and the other child says, &quot;You can have it in a minute<br/>\nwhen I am done, but I&#39;d like to finish this thing first.&quot;  My daughter<br/>\nerupts, causing such a screaming outburst that I have to physically<br/>\nrestrain her until we get into a room alone so that that she doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhurt herself, the other child, the toy, or me.  Once she is in a room in<br/>\nthe house (or in the car if we are out and about- different, but similar<br/>\nsituation), she usually gets calm unless she hears other people and<br/>\nknows that they can hear her (then she starts beating up everything in<br/>\nsight).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example:<br/>\nWe, as a family, go to another person&#39;s house.  She is forewarned that<br/>\nwe&#39;ll be there for 1 hour and she brings books, etc. to occupy her if<br/>\nshe is not enjoying being there.  We walk in the door, she is polite and<br/>\nfine.  As soon as we start a conversation with the people in the house,<br/>\nmy daughter starts whining and screaming that she is not having any fun<br/>\nand this is boring.  This quickly turns into her thrashing on the floor,<br/>\nnot hearing any words that come out of our mouths.  She is sometimes<br/>\nconsolable only if left completely alone with a book to read (but no one<br/>\ndare talk to her).  The house owners usually wonder what in the world<br/>\nthey did wrong and she glared at them when we leave.  [This has happened<br/>\ntwice in the last couple of week, but we seldom go over to others<br/>\nhouses, thank goodness!  I&#39;d like to more, but I am afraid to and she is<br/>\ntoo young to be left alone.  I am thinking of &quot;forcing&quot;, yes FORCING on<br/>\nthis one (help me if I am wrong) her to write (with my help) an apology<br/>\nfor her behavior to these other people who think she is a monster.  She<br/>\ndoes feel sorry for her actions now, or she at least claims to, but I<br/>\nknow that she&#39;d do it again in a second.]<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve role played these situations beforehand (with her &quot;acting&quot; just<br/>\nfine).  We&#39;ve role reversed, too.  We&#39;ve talked and talked to no<br/>\neffect.  I&#39;ve read all the books (&quot;Spirited Child&quot;, &quot;Explosive Child&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;How to talk...&quot;) and tried the examples, but none the children in these<br/>\nbooks are anything like my own.  I&#39;m at my wit&#39;s end.  When talking<br/>\nafter a situation, she really believes that she did nothing wrong.  She<br/>\nknows that hitting, etc. is wrong (we don&#39;t hit her!), but feels<br/>\njustified that she had a right to do what she did because she was mad<br/>\nand the rest of the world was being mean to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp!  My parents are here visiting right now (been here 4 days and will<br/>\nbe here 4 more) and they are acting (but not outright saying,<br/>\nthankfully) that we are parenting her SO bad and that if only we&#39;d put<br/>\nher in public schools that she&#39;d be shamed into not doing this<br/>\nnonsense.  I know this isn&#39;t true, and I can make really good arguments<br/>\nfor the educational aspect of unschooling, but I can&#39;t come up with an<br/>\nargument for the emotional/getting along with others aspect of<br/>\nunschooling, especially when it appears as if we are failing in this<br/>\naspect.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are natural consequences for these actions:  People start not<br/>\nliking you (including me at times!).  Have I given her too much<br/>\nfreedom?  Am I turning her into a monster?  To be completely honest, I<br/>\noften feel like she deserves a good spanking (I&#39;ve told her that is what<br/>\nother parents often do).  I walk away when I feel that way (she usually<br/>\nfollows!) and I know that is wrong.  My parents claim (again, with no<br/>\nreal words) that children are only violent like this if their parents<br/>\nare violent to them!  I&#39;ve learned that this is not true.  Help!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any and all advice!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lisa in AZ<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
