I&#39;m glad we all did (and do) daily living activities <br/>\ntogether. I&#39;m glad that when they sat with me watching tv and folding laundry <br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t insist that things be done a certain way. Even though I do have <br/>\na specific way to fold things. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m glad that a quick vacuum of the living <br/>\nroom rug or washing the dishes isn&#39;t a huge deal. I&#39;m happy that cleaning the <br/>\nbathroom isn&#39;t dreaded. I don&#39;t think it was lazy of me to pick up after the <br/>\nkids, or that I was making them lazy. I didn&#39;t *create* lazy or resentful <br/>\nkids. Both have things they don&#39;t like or enjoy doing, but don&#39;t we all! I&#39;m <br/>\nglad that Darin and I fostered a healthy, respectful attitude about helping <br/>\nand pulling together and family. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been having a few problems as I near the end of my pregnancy. I&#39;m on <br/>\norders from my Dr. to rest as much as possible, and taking medication for my <br/>\nheart. It&#39;s hard, especially with Darin on the road. He&#39;s got Jack with him, <br/>\nso its just Moly and me. I know that if, when Moly was younger, I had insisted <br/>\non chores and the rest that now she could be resentful about doing extra <br/>\nthings for me. But she doesn&#39;t mind doing the laundry and I can still fold it <br/>\nsitting in bed or on the couch. Last weekend Darin was home and we put a chair <br/>\nin the kitchen for me and he helped me make up a few meals that I split into <br/>\nsmaller portions and now Moly doesn&#39;t have to cook, just thaw and warm. And <br/>\nshe appreciates that. And even though I really shouldn&#39;t get up and drive her <br/>\nplaces I still do. It doesn&#39;t take much out of me to drive her to her drum <br/>\nlessons or to her youth group activities. She appreciates that and shows it <br/>\nwith the little things she does around the house for me. She has been unsure <br/>\nand almost standoffish about the whole baby thing, and Darin and I could have <br/>\nmade my need to rest worse. We could have said &#39;Mom can&#39;t do this so you have <br/>\nto&#39;. I believe that since we&#39;ve never said anything like that before and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t say that now, she isn&#39;t looking at helping out more now as a chore or a <br/>\nburden. She may be unsure about the baby, but she doesn&#39;t resent the baby, her <br/>\nDad, or me. She has grown to appreciate what I&#39;ve always done for her and the <br/>\nrest of the family and knows that the appreciation runs both ways. Especially <br/>\nnow. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know from friends experiences with their kids and my own feelings toward my <br/>\nparents that creating an adversial relationship about chores (or anything <br/>\nbetween children and parents) can and does come back to bite you in the ass. <br/>\nYou always have a choice. Helping your children, showing them, guiding them, <br/>\nrespecting them, acknowledging their abilities... it all goes a long way <br/>\ntoward family harmony. And isn&#39;t that the goal in the long run? <br/>\n~Nancy <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223130287,"authorName":"Krisula Moyer","from":"&quot;Krisula Moyer&quot; &lt;krisula@...&gt;","profile":"krisulaula","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Re: Little ones helping out?","postDate":"1138220592","msgId":111468,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTI1MjAyMy5rMFBLTkJJZzAxNzI0OUBtcy1zbXRwLTAxLWVyaTAuc29jYWwucnIuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":111454,"nextInTopic":111471,"prevInTime":111467,"nextInTime":111469,"topicId":111413,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... to them.

The other day, they <br/>\nchopped potatoes and onions (Em learned about chopping onions and plans <br/>\non choosing potatoes next time! *g*), they&#39;ve been scrambling their own <br/>\neggs, making their own oatmeal (Em showed Sam how to do his), chopping <br/>\nand steaming vegetables and helping make pasta and rice. They certainly <br/>\ndon&#39;t do this every time I cook, but I always welcome them when they <br/>\nask. For a long time, they liked helping make pizza dough, cookies and <br/>\nbread, but then they got bored with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust this weekend, I asked the girls to help me in their room, which had <br/>\nbecome *very* messy and completely un-navigable--pretty much everything <br/>\nin there was on the floor. I asked them to let me know when they were <br/>\nready to tackle it.  Jules decided she was ready at some point in the <br/>\nafternoon and came and got me, but Em didn&#39;t feel ready. I asked her if <br/>\nshe felt like sitting on her bed and keeping us company, which she did. <br/>\nI did much of the work, which I usually do, but Jules helped a lot, <br/>\nwhich she usually does and Em ran a few errands here and there--taking <br/>\ncups to the sink and dirty clothes to the laundry. I ended up diving <br/>\ninto lots of their bins and asking them to help me sort through stuff <br/>\nthey no longer wanted. We also reworked their clothes baskets to create <br/>\nmore room--really an all day affair.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the day, I asked them to do me the favor of keeping the <br/>\nfloor cleaned up until tomorrow so I could run a vacuum. They asked why <br/>\nI didn&#39;t just run the vacuum now, so I told them I needed to get Sam&#39;s <br/>\nroom cleaned up first and just didn&#39;t have the energy. They were fine <br/>\nwith that, and we went about our evening--dinner, playing and finally <br/>\ncurled up in our room to watch a movie and fall asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs everyone else was falling asleep, Em, my nightowl, got up and cleaned <br/>\nand organized her brother&#39;s room (a much more straight-forward job than <br/>\ntheir room!). It was a gift to him and a gift to me--all freely given. I <br/>\ndoubt she would have felt so generous if I&#39;d made her clean her room <br/>\nwith us earlier that day because it was *her* room, and I&#39;m not sure she <br/>\nwould have thought to do it if I hadn&#39;t been modeling that kind of <br/>\ngenerosity for her most of her life. Maybe she would have, I don&#39;t <br/>\nreally know. But, I do know this is what happened in our home this past <br/>\nweekend, and I know that it&#39;s not an unusual thing to have happen.

There&#39;s an ocean between one-syllable &quot;reading&quot; of books  <br/>\nwith only 27 words and what parents could read to a child, but many  <br/>\nthousands of kids (probably millions) have been cut off cold when  <br/>\nthey learn to read.

Add that to the long  <br/>\nlist of why pressing reading is bad, and why expecting kids to read  <br/>\nas soon as possible (while parents are not being analytical about  <br/>\nwhat reading really is) will cause more trouble than good.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so with housework.

This  <br/>\nafternoon Holly and I went and bought him a black wool cap and a  <br/>\nthermal shirt, because he was cold at work today, and is getting a  <br/>\nsore throat and a cough.  I paid for those things.  It&#39;s for his job,  <br/>\nand I *could* have told him to buy them, or to pay me back.  But he&#39;s  <br/>\nlearning from having that job, and it&#39;s good exercise, and these are  <br/>\nclothes he&#39;ll wear when he&#39;s not at work too, and I don&#39;t see why he  <br/>\nshould have to pay EVERYthing now just because he has a job.<br/>\n<br/>\nTomorrow he will be warmer.<br/>\n<br/>\nYears from now he will more calmly and generously go out and get  <br/>\nsomething for someone else without feeling martyrly or put-upon or  <br/>\ntaken-advantage-of, because he will think that&#39;s just how people  <br/>\nshould be, and just how parents should be, and just how friends  <br/>\nshould be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t send him the bill financially OR emotionally or socially.   <br/>\nHe looks good in that hat.

If you want to  <br/>\nbe their partner, you&#39;re going to work against that by making them do  <br/>\nthings they don&#39;t understand and aren&#39;t competent at.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids can&#39;t understand in the way adults do why things need to be put  <br/>\naway so basically it&#39;s similar to your husband making you scrub the  <br/>\nceiling every week.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids aren&#39;t as competent at organizing as it seems they are. If you  <br/>\nlook at the worst mess in your house and then magnify it by 10 rooms  <br/>\nthat might be approaching what a kid sees when they see a pile of  <br/>\ntoys.
