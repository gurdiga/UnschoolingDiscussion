For starters we realized that we <br/>\nwere wrong to keep our son in school just like we were raised. You had <br/>\nproblems, you got hurt, you stayed in school, to leave is to run away was how <br/>\nwe were raised. So, we took him out and decided to keep him out and that was <br/>\na big change for us as parents. We were very loving parents, played with our <br/>\nson, gave him lots of hugs and I love you, never hit, never screamed BUT we <br/>\nwere very strict with our son and he never once really gave us any reason why <br/>\nwe had to be. He had a certain bed time, a required reading time, good grades <br/>\nto keep, he would have to go to bed early for speaking his mind, he had <br/>\nrequired chores, he had to dress in clothes that we thought looked nice, and <br/>\non and on. Our son never got onto any trouble in school, he was always <br/>\nconsidered to be the quiet, shy nerd. He would never fight back when he was <br/>\ngetting beat up and he would never speak up to anyone in school. No wonder <br/>\nwhy, because of us! It was quite easy for us to change but it was hard to <br/>\nrealize that we needed to change. I feel the most important change we have <br/>\nmade as parents is that we are more open and we talk more and share more. <br/>\nThat was hard especially for me coming from a family of no communication and <br/>\nalways being told (till this day) my opinions don&#39;t matter or that I am a <br/>\npoor communicator, be quiet and so on. I wonder why. All my life I&#39;ve always <br/>\nbeen scared to talk to anyone because of what they may think. Now, I talk <br/>\nwith my son more than before but with an open mind and a big heart and he is <br/>\nsoaking it up so much sometimes I swear I see smoke coming from his mouth!  <br/>\nWe also now take the time to listen to him even when we&#39;re busy. Normally it <br/>\nwould be wait till later, we no longer put him off, he does come first. One <br/>\nchange I have not been able to master would be the guilt I feel everyday <br/>\nlooking at him. I can&#39;t have anymore children, I just lost a child on <br/>\nChristmas, and Chris is our only one. I wish I would have unschooled him long <br/>\nago, I wish I didn&#39;t walk in my parents footsteps, something I swore when I <br/>\nleft home at 15 years old I would never do. I wish I can turn back time but I <br/>\ncan&#39;t, I wish I could have gave him a better childhood than I had but it&#39;s <br/>\ntoo late. These feelings I can&#39;t change or maybe I can&#39;t let go of, something <br/>\nI hope someday I can change, that and the embarrassment of who I used to be.<br/>\nKim</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140266224,"authorName":"jk_lenzmeier","from":"&quot;jk_lenzmeier&quot; &lt;jk_lenzmeier@...&gt;","profile":"jk_lenzmeier","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Homeschooling Teenagers","postDate":"1052581755","msgId":68456,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI5ajcxcis0ajkxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNmLjFjN2E5YzIyLjJiZWU0ZWVmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":68418,"nextInTopic":68499,"prevInTime":68455,"nextInTime":68457,"topicId":68417,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If you don t mind, can you say what kind of parenting changes you made? ... school that he ... good ... had all ... to mention ... rebel against ... that we ve","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-950050584\">If you don&#39;t mind, can you say what kind of parenting changes you <br/>\nmade?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, HOMESCHOOL4GOOD@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *You are so right Sandra.
