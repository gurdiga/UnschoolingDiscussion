It was cheaper than anything else at the time.  We cut the<br/>\nplywood so that it looked like wide floor planks and put it down plank<br/>\nstyle.  David counter sunk the screws and plugged the holes.  We stained<br/>\nit antique oak and finished it with that poly stuff they use on<br/>\nbasketball courts.  That stuff shines and I&#39;m not crazy about it but we<br/>\nwere going for something durable enough to stand up to moist critter<br/>\nincidents.   It was rustic-ish, but it was a uh, cabin, after all.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know how long it lasted for sure.  We moved a couple years later. <br/>\nOak plywood probably costs more now but there are other kinds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou could paint rugs on it too, before you seal it.  We did that in a<br/>\ndifferent house.

That&#39;d be cold<br/>\nthough, and hard.  Painted rugs wouldn&#39;t help, you&#39;d have to buy the real<br/>\ndeal.

I may go over the tough spots again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe carpet will still look as beat up as ever, but at least it will be clean and SMELL clean I hope :o).<br/>\n<br/>\nHome Depot is having a special where if you buy over $300 worth of stuff, you don&#39;t pay on it for a whole year.  I *might* take advantage of that for laminate wood flooring, IF the subfloor is in good enough shape.  There is also laminate wood flooring on sale for $40/case, with a 15 year warranty.<br/>\n<br/>\n But I have to tear up the carpet to see how the subfloor is.  (The room is 24x17, so its a large area of carpet to be ripped up too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf its level, I&#39;ll put some kind of plywood down (Probably luwan).  But if its swelled anywhere I might not be able to do that.  I could possibly cut the swelled areas out and replace them with fresh particle board.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other problem I might have is that if the laminate wood raises the floor level up too high, I may have to cut down the front door to get it to fit.
