If that is it, then there are a few basic types of <br/>\nvegetarians: lacto-ovo vegetarians eat dairy products and eggs along with <br/>\nvegetarian foods, lacto vegetarians would use dairy products but no eggs, ovo <br/>\nvegetarian would use eggs but no dairy. Complete vegetarians eat no animal <br/>\nproducts at all. To really be considered a vegan, from what I&#39;m reading, you <br/>\nneed to take it a step further and as much as possible rid yourself of animal <br/>\nproducts in everything (meaning no leather, no wool, no honey...plus there <br/>\nare hidden animal ingredients in many many foods). It&#39;s basically impossible <br/>\nto be 100% vegan since if you drive a car your tires contain animal products, <br/>\nif you go to the movies, the film contains gelatin, and so on. Vegans try to <br/>\nminimize the exploitation of animals as much as they possibly can, realizing <br/>\nthat it&#39;s not a perfect world. I still have my leather shoes and occasionally <br/>\nuse honey so I guess I&#39;m not a true vegan but I&#39;m getting there :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that wasn&#39;t what you were asking, I&#39;m sorry. I just couldn&#39;t tell exactly <br/>\nwhat you meant by vegan terminology. I&#39;ll be glad to try again if you ask!<br/>\n<br/>\nPriss</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11111,"nextTopicId":11121}}
