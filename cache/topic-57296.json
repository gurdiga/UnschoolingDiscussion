I really liked the way he warned against pigeonholing <br/>\nchildren by thinking of them as only 1 of the types.  The chapter on <br/>\nlearning disabilities was excellent -- basically, he says that schools <br/>\npathologize what are actually strengths (spatial learners are labelled <br/>\n&quot;dyslexic,&quot; etc.) in order to collect government funding for special ed <br/>\nprograms and because schools are not set up to accommodate those who <br/>\naren&#39;t linguistic or logical/mathematical learners.  He is very <br/>\nfavorable to homeschooling, and mentions John Holt numerous times, <br/>\nalthough it isn&#39;t a homeschooling book, per se.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Jackie Chovanes<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jchovanes@...\">jchovanes@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Howard Gardner","postDate":"1108271872","msgId":103372,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFmMi41MGM0YWE2LjJmNDAzZDAwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":57296,"nextInTopic":103381,"prevInTime":103371,"nextInTime":103373,"topicId":57296,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Frames of Mind is the one I read, but you don t really have to get that.
