The office, and how important \nDaddy&#39;s work is, and all the&nbsp;ways his job helps people. Maybe if he saw \nwhere he was everyday he could relate to his job a little better.&nbsp; Son \ncould give Daddy a special object that he can carry around with him when he is \nat work, perhaps.&nbsp; And all prayers are great.&nbsp; AN expression of ones \nhopes, and concerns, some days I may pray , and include some worrisome thoughts, \nbut they will pass.&nbsp; But that is a high stress job, maybe focusing on the \nactivities that aren&#39;t so scary.&nbsp; My husband climbs trees, and at times \nthis can be a hazard, but few people can do this type of job, and Daddy loves \nit.&nbsp; SO we try to have fun with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; \nMichelle</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10986,"nextTopicId":10993}}
