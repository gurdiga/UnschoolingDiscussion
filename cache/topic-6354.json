I am not familiar with the area in which you are seeking. This organization is christian based but they are really helpfull as to the local contact info. In my area, all that is required is an attendance record to be filed with the attendance officer in our county (with a &quot;description&quot; of the curriculum used). Good luck and hope they choose UNschooling. I would hate to see a family d i v i d e d over the miles when UNschooling could bring them together like nothing else can!
