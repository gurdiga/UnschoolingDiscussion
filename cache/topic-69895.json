She&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; been at camp all weekend and feels too tired to go back to school in the<br/>\n&gt; morning.  She didn&#39;t feel like going home and reading for homework.  My<br/>\n </span></blockquote>kids<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; were doing it for fun!  For the excitement and joy of learning!  How<br/>\n </span></blockquote>blessed<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; we truly are!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While cleaning out the laundry room cabinets (the equivilant of most<br/>\n&gt; peoples&#39; &#39;junk drawers&#39; only 80 times as big) I found newborn pictures of<br/>\n&gt; Chloe and the cutest picture of all the kids on hands and knees crawling<br/>\n&gt; away from the camera in a long side-by-side line.  I hung my gift from<br/>\n&gt; Laurie on the fridge to help me smile while going about my dreary business<br/>\n&gt; at hand.  Instead of packing away the pictures of Chloe and the kids, I<br/>\n&gt; grabbed a coke and took a break to remember the joy and peace of her birth<br/>\n&gt; and what a fun day we had that day.  When I came in the house, Ethan was<br/>\n&gt; sitting in the kitchen floor with empty cupcake papers and the salt and<br/>\n&gt; pepper, making &#39;birthday cakes&#39;.  I had just mopped the kitchen floor.  I<br/>\n&gt; just wanted to scream and cry.  Instead, I grabbed him and carried him off<br/>\n&gt; to bed.  I sang him a soft song and rubbed his beautiful face until he<br/>\n </span></blockquote>fell<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; asleep.  For an hour, I went from room to room, carressing my sleeping<br/>\n&gt; little angels.  Little by little my patience returned.  A wave of peace<br/>\n&gt; washed over me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Our sheets still haven&#39;t made it into the washer.  The house is still a<br/>\n&gt; mess.  But my kids are all sleeping peacefully.  I have a beautful picture<br/>\n&gt; hanging on my fridge that no professional artist nor writer could ever<br/>\n&gt; compare with.   There are no alarm clocks set, no homework due.  When the<br/>\n&gt; kids wake up their Daddy will be home and they will scream with joy to see<br/>\n&gt; him again.  And they will have all day to be with him and catch up on the<br/>\n&gt; latest lost tooth, the birthday party he missed and tell him all the new<br/>\n&gt; words they learned to spell.  He&#39;ll get to hear Chloe say Dada for the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>first<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; time with his own ears as the girls all sit around praising her as if she<br/>\n&gt; were the smartest baby ever born.

I am thankful they are<br/>\n&gt; home, were they belong, for if they were in school, they would miss these<br/>\n&gt; beautiful moments.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can only say, look for every shining light in every day.  If there were<br/>\n </span></blockquote>no<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sour, trying moments, what need would we have for patience?   Through<br/>\n </span></blockquote>trial<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and error, we become better parents.  Better people.  If we can see the<br/>\n&gt; light in the face of darkness we become more loving, patient and giving<br/>\n&gt; individuals.

We are paid in love, smiles, hugs and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>kisses,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and bright little eyes that sparkle with each new discovery.  But perhaps<br/>\n&gt; even more valueable, our children look into *our* eyes for comfort and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>find<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; peace after a skinned toe, a broken toy or a love-torn heart.  It is a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hard<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; job, but it is priceless.

He has a heck of a temper and<br/>\n&gt; when he is mad he starts throwing his body around, throwing things of<br/>\n&gt; tables, will NOT let you hold or console him and usually ends up<br/>\n&gt; getting hurt in the process &lt;sigh&gt;.  I have made a huge effort lately<br/>\n&gt; to really pay attention to his cues so things do not escalate and<br/>\n&gt; that is helping alot.  I am also much more flexible with his<br/>\n&gt; demands.  The other day he wanted juice, so I got a juice, still<br/>\n&gt; moaning.  DO you want milk? okay, than a change of mind.  After a few<br/>\n&gt; minutes of struggle he wanted a regular cup with ice tea like a big<br/>\n&gt; boy..LOL!  Of course he spilled it a minute later..LOL!  I never<br/>\n&gt; would have continued to figure out the problem in the past.  It took<br/>\n&gt; less time then one of his tantrums and left an overall feeling of<br/>\n&gt; peace.  Anyway, we still have some really difficult moments and I<br/>\n&gt; feel tears come because I don&#39;t feel I handled it in the best way.<br/>\n&gt; At least our consciousness of the problem and desire to change are a<br/>\n&gt; step in the right direction!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Olga :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Nicholina ODonnell&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;arodonn@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; With all the talk about those who don&#39;t post, I thought I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; introduce myself as one of those non-posters, there-by removing<br/>\n&gt; myself from that catigory.  :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been lurking for about a month now and enjoy the list, though<br/>\n&gt; occationally do mass deletes to catch up.
