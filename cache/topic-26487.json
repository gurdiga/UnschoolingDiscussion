I think it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; truth, but it doesn&#39;t allow the personal respect and freedom. And as the<br/>\n&gt; counselors say, it&#39;s about using more *I* statements and less *you*<br/>\n&gt; statements.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a fan of Dr. Phil McGraw, who is most famous for his appearances on<br/>\nOprah, but has done a lot of other really cool things.<br/>\n<br/>\nOprah calls Phil&#39;s style &quot;Tell it like it is&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember one story of his of how he was REALLY bad as a marriage<br/>\ncounselor, because a couple would come in, each would talk for awhile, Dr.<br/>\nPhil would say, &quot;Okay, here&#39;s what you can do&quot; and offer a reasonable<br/>\nsolution based on action.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe couples didn&#39;t like this. They wanted to spend years with Phil couching<br/>\nthings nicely and talking about their feelings instead of their actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like it when people tell me like it is. If I disagree with them on that, I<br/>\nam free to ignore their advice. NOBODY here is following anybody else home<br/>\nand making sure they do as they&#39;re told.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake or leave what you read, here or anywhere. I find advice that is NOT<br/>\ntell it like it is very annoying to me personally. Sweet and wimpy just<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t do it for me. So what? I need to deal with that irritant on my own<br/>\n-- I am still free to take the advice or leave it, nor is it up to me to<br/>\ntell someone they should be more direct.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26709,"nextTopicId":26715}}
