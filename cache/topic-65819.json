If you took an academic class, <br/>\n&gt; for example, academic algebra I, you got 4 credits multiplied by your <br/>\n&gt; grade.

If you get an A in English it&#39;s 4 points, an A <br/>\nin Chemistry 4 points.  A D in Geometry, 1 point.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are such things as AP classes in 11th and 12th grades that can earn you <br/>\nextra points on your GPA, like an A in an AP English class might be worth 5 <br/>\npoints because you did &quot;harder&quot; work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are all added up and averaged.  So if you took 27 classes, you add up <br/>\nthe grades = numbers, divide by the number.  If you FAIL a class, it counts <br/>\nas a zero, even if you repeat it and get an A, the zero still counts in your <br/>\nGPA.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in reality you should have a GPA of somewhere between 5 and a possible <br/>\nzero.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou do have to take a VA Passport Literacy Test to prove you are ready for <br/>\nHigh School, if you don&#39;t pass it after two or three or four times, then you <br/>\nare asked to do remedial work.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course in VA you have also heard about the dreaded SOL exams.

There <br/>\nare often exams in order to pass individual classes, but the only <br/>\nthing that you have to do in order to graduate is to have enough <br/>\ncredits.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how it worked in my school.  If you took an academic class, <br/>\nfor example, academic algebra I, you got 4 credits multiplied by your <br/>\ngrade.  A&#39;s were worth 4, B&#39;s were 3, c&#39;s were 2, d&#39;s were 1.  So an <br/>\nA in algebra I would be worth 16 points. (4 X 4).  A C in albegra I <br/>\nwould be worth 8 points. (4 X 2).  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if you took basic algebra instead of academic algebra I, you <br/>\nget 2.5 times your grade.  So an A in basic algebra would be worth 10 <br/>\npoints. (4 X 2.5)  Much less points than if you got an A in academic <br/>\nalgebra I, so anyone who had any ambition struggled through the <br/>\nacademic course even if they weren&#39;t really ready for it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSame thing with Englishes, sciences, social studies...basic English <br/>\nwould be 2.5 X your grade, but American literature or composition II <br/>\nwould be worth 4 times your grade.  <br/>\n<br/>\nhome ec and shop classes were worth 2.5 times grade, foreign <br/>\nlanguages were worth 4 times grade.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Top&quot; kids competing for grade point averages would never, ever take <br/>\nstudy halls, because they wouldn&#39;t get any points for them.  Kids who <br/>\ncould care less about grade point average took as many as they were <br/>\nallowed.  Therefore it was always the &quot;bad&quot; kids in study halls.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy senior year I got away without taking physics and it didn&#39;t hurt <br/>\nmy grade point average because I discovered that human physiology was <br/>\nmuch easier and was still worth 4 points.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe disgusting games we teach our kids!<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ah.

There <br/>\nare often exams in order to pass individual classes, but the only <br/>\nthing that you have to do in order to graduate is to have enough <br/>\ncredits.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how it worked in my school.  If you took an academic class, <br/>\nfor example, academic algebra I, you got 4 credits multiplied by your <br/>\ngrade.  A&#39;s were worth 4, B&#39;s were 3, c&#39;s were 2, d&#39;s were 1.  So an <br/>\nA in algebra I would be worth 16 points. (4 X 4).  A C in albegra I <br/>\nwould be worth 8 points. (4 X 2).  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if you took basic algebra instead of academic algebra I, you <br/>\nget 2.5 times your grade.  So an A in basic algebra would be worth 10 <br/>\npoints. (4 X 2.5)  Much less points than if you got an A in academic <br/>\nalgebra I, so anyone who had any ambition struggled through the <br/>\nacademic course even if they weren&#39;t really ready for it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSame thing with Englishes, sciences, social studies...basic English <br/>\nwould be 2.5 X your grade, but American literature or composition II <br/>\nwould be worth 4 times your grade.  <br/>\n<br/>\nhome ec and shop classes were worth 2.5 times grade, foreign <br/>\nlanguages were worth 4 times grade.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Top&quot; kids competing for grade point averages would never, ever take <br/>\nstudy halls, because they wouldn&#39;t get any points for them.  Kids who <br/>\ncould care less about grade point average took as many as they were <br/>\nallowed.  Therefore it was always the &quot;bad&quot; kids in study halls.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy senior year I got away without taking physics and it didn&#39;t hurt <br/>\nmy grade point average because I discovered that human physiology was <br/>\nmuch easier and was still worth 4 points.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe disgusting games we teach our kids!<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ah.
