Family Pastimes has a cooperative (players<br/>\nwork together rather than against each other) board game called MAX<br/>\n(which won a top-rating from Canada Toy Testing).  Here is the<br/>\ndescription from the catalog:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe must help get the little Creatures safely home before Max, the Tomcat,<br/>\ncatches them.  In an exciting way, children learn logic, consultation &<br/>\ndecision making.  An important issue to discuss is also raised: we don&#39;t<br/>\nlike Max catching those Little Ones, yet we recognize that he is a<br/>\nnatural hunter.  How do we resolve this in our minds & hearts?  Let&#39;s<br/>\ntalk it over.  Ages: 4-7 Play alone or with as many as 8 players.
