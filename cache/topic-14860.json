What about the required <br/>\nstandardized testing each  year?  How do you handle the paperwork? <br/>\nDo <br/>\nthe school districts breathe down your backs or what?  Neither my dh <br/>\nnor I have our four year degrees so that creates a host of problems <br/>\nalthough my sister does have a teachers license for MN and is willing <br/>\nto &quot;keep track&quot; of us.  (What a joke...her current class is made up<br/>\nof <br/>\n26 students yet they want all this documentation from us). Anyway, I <br/>\nwould appreciate any tips you all have for making this easier.  I am <br/>\nset to web only so please reply to my email.   Many, many thanks and <br/>\nhave a blessed day!<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14859,"nextTopicId":14861}}
