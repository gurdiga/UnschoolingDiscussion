History, science, marine biology.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were out walking the pier about 2 months ago and this guy had what looked like a mini hammerhead, except the head didn&#39;t look quite right.

What a hoot!  My folks gace me the tickets for Christmas and the <br/>\n  whole family drove over from Gainesville for the day.
