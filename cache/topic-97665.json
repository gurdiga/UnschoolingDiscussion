Teachers take over","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-982404921\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amsfperform.org/learned.html\">http://www.amsfperform.org/learned.html</a><br/>\n  <br/>\nWhen people go to school or take lessons they lose control of the agenda of=\r<br/>\n their <br/>\ncuriosity. Teachers take over the subject and timing of learning. The indiv=\r<br/>\nidual&#39;s curiosity <br/>\nno longer leads. In some places it counts for nothing. No matter who we are=\r<br/>\n, how good or <br/>\nbad a student we are, the natural instincts of our own curiosity suffered m=\r<br/>\nany bruises.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a real sense, the pleasures and rewards of satisfying our curiosity were=\r<br/>\n taken away from <br/>\nus. School is not about rewarding our own curiosity, it&#39;s about learning wh=\r<br/>\nat others want <br/>\nus to learn; it&#39;s about pleasing teachers. If we were successful in school =\r<br/>\nthe one thing we <br/>\nhad to learn was to make teachers happy enough to give us good grades. We m=\r<br/>\nay or may <br/>\nnot have learned things interesting to us, but that wasn&#39;t the point. Succe=\r<br/>\nssful students <br/>\nmust please enough teachers to get enough good grades to continue in the pr=\r<br/>\nocess.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, having already lost the agenda and rewards of our own curiosity, we c=\r<br/>\nome to believe <br/>\nthat pleasing the teacher is the same as pleasing ourselves. We substitute =\r<br/>\nlearning how we <br/>\nwant with learning the way that will make the teacher happy. We think pleas=\r<br/>\ning the teacher <br/>\nis the same as pleasing ourselves. It isn&#39;t. That&#39;s why so many straight &quot;A=\r<br/>\n&quot; students are <br/>\nunfulfilled by their accomplishment. They feel a void. They&#39;ve become so ad=\r<br/>\nept at pleasing <br/>\nother people that they forget they have a self that needs being pleased.<br/>\n<br/>\n{snip}<br/>\n<br/>\nYou would not believe how difficult it is to get adult students to be pleas=\r<br/>\ned with their <br/>\nwork. It wasn&#39;t until I started listening to them talk to themselves that I=\r<br/>\n really began to <br/>\nrealize how much their past education had taken from them. When they make m=\r<br/>\nistakes <br/>\nthey say things like: &quot;That was stupid,&quot; &quot;What are you thinking of?&quot; or &quot;Oh=\r<br/>\n, my God.&quot; The <br/>\ncondescension in their voices is impressive. They are not talking to themse=\r<br/>\nlves with their <br/>\nown voices; they are talking to themselves with the voices of past teachers=\r<br/>\n and parents. <br/>\nPonder the enormity of this. They have become their own attackers. When did=\r<br/>\n they <br/>\nabandon themselves and join the accusers? Who is left to defend them?<br/>\n<br/>\n{snip}<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople do not understand that being a teacher&#39;s best student can bring with=\r<br/>\n it a number of <br/>\ndisadvantages. Educational problems are always assumed to be the domain of =\r<br/>\nlesser <br/>\nstudents, but there is a whole raft of problems the really good students ex=\r<br/>\nperience. <br/>\nTeachers push them too fast and too far, beyond what they can really experi=\r<br/>\nence. <br/>\nTeachers become possessive of the student and the student&#39;s accomplishment.=\r<br/>\n Teachers <br/>\nover-identify with their best students, especially if the former don&#39;t have=\r<br/>\n a fulfilling life of <br/>\ntheir own. Actually, this subject is a whole other talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97471,"nextTopicId":97656}}
