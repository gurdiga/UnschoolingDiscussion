I build up every day the kind of loving, connected relationship that will allow them to be open with me (as I was not with my mother) about their desire to try something. I support their choices and desires every day so that they feel loved and valued as unique individuals. Something as paltry as a cigarette is nowhere near as powerful as that.***<br/>\n<br/>\nA while ago, my 7yo son asked if he could try a cigarette; he said he just wanted to see what it was about.  I was very shocked & didn&#39;t know what to do.  I looked online with him to see what cigarettes can do to your body - showed him pics of healthy & unhealthy lungs - I told him that this is what could happen after smoking for a very long time.  There was also this video I found that showed what nicotine does to your body as well.  He still wanted to try it, so his sister came up with the idea of making a paper cigarette which he smoked, but it did not satisfy him, so I suggested putting the guinea pigs&#39; Timothy hay inside.  He lit it up & smoked (& choked), but it gave him an idea of what it was like.  Out of curiosity, I tried one myself & was amazed at how real it &quot;seemed&quot; (from what I remember when I tried a cigarette in my college yrs).  After that he & his younger sister made paper cigarettes just to watch the smoke come from them for about a month.  That was it for him - for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say, though, that I showed him the pics & video out of fear that he would want to keep smoking, so I was dishonest in my intent to &quot;help&quot; him with his curiosity.  I wish I had seen these posts before because reading this has helped me realize what I did & being dishonest out of fear is not something I want to continue - that is not being supportive & it will diminish the trust between me & my children.  At the time it was to benefit me (allay the fear of the future) & not him.  The two statements above that I quoted are realistic and something I&#39;m working on everyday. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, last month my 5yo daughter asked what her uncle was drinking & my sister (his wife) told him that it was soda, so she came up to me & asked if she could have some & I told her that it was Not soda & that it was an adult drink that makes you feel icky.  Later I thought to myself, &quot;why did I say that?&quot; that she&#39;s probably thinking, &quot;If it makes you feel so icky then why does he keep drinking it?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess, I would have to ask - what do you do in these two situations?  I mean, a teenager can understand the issues about cost of cigs, the social ostracizing, addiction, etc, but how do you approach smoking, alcohol, drugs with young children when they ask about it or want to try it?  Again, I want to be truly supportive & trustworthy, so how do I go about it with them at this age?  Do I tell my son what I did & tell him that he can smoke a real cigarette & my daughter too with the beer?  Do I do a rewind even though these issues came up over a month ago? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any suggestions & thanks for another wonderful topic - wow, another eye opener.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Alcohol, mostly (was Teens and Smoking)","postDate":"1342606047","msgId":68240,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY4MEIxNEM5LUJENkYtNEM3Ny1CM0RDLUQxREMzMEY3NEUyNkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGp1NWtyZStldXVjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGp1NWtyZStldXVjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68239,"nextInTopic":68243,"prevInTime":68239,"nextInTime":68241,"topicId":68200,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We could have brandy when we came in from skiing when it was really cold. When we went to our grandmother&#39;s for Sunday dinner our aunt served us full glasses of wine or mixed drinks. I rarely finished them but I did find the flavors interesting though didn&#39;t like the floaty feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur parents could have been more connected, but I was an introvert so enjoyed the freedom to be alone. There was a lot of freedom to roam. They had expectations but they fit with my own choices. So my childhood was pretty happy. I didn&#39;t try smoking. Didn&#39;t try drugs. And I drink maybe 3 or 4 bottles of wine a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister is more of a social introvert. She didn&#39;t do as well at school. So her childhood wasn&#39;t as good of a match. She tried smoking. She used to smoke pot. She drinks more, though I don&#39;t remember seeing her drunk. She&#39;s definitely struggled more with finding contentment but not horribly so. Pretty much our contentment matches our addictive substances consumption. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCarl&#39;s parents were similar to mine, more tight reined though more connected. His personality is similar to mine so the match wasn&#39;t bad. Carl drank beer starting in high school and through college. Very stereotypical teen behavior. The amount of beer he&#39;s drunk over the years pretty much reflects his recovery from control to finding his own contentment. He might drink a couple of six packs a year at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as alcohol is concerned, I did the same with Kathryn. She had the freedom to try whatever she wanted at home. She occasionally had a little wine, a little flavored brandy, but generally preferred non-alcoholic drinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer 21st birthday was on the 13th. Despite having a big posse of friends out in Michigan, she chose to come home for it :-) I suggested a tour and tasting at the local fruit winery. She added the suggestion of beer tasting. So we toured the Sam Adams brewery. And that was as heavy as her drinking was while home for 11 days. On her own she had a glass of the fortified wine we bought at the winery. And yesterday morning on her last day she poured a glass of strawberry rhubarb wine to go with the berries and the Russian rum flavored cake she&#39;d bought a few days before. Mostly she ate the berries. Most of the wine was poured back.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s probably the happiest and most content of us all :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Teens and Smoking","postDate":"1342593576","msgId":68238,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA0RTEwRDgwLUYyOTUtNDYzOS1COUYxLUI0OTMzMjIyMkYzQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNDI1ODI2OTQuNDEzNy5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTIyNTA0Lm1haWwubmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzNDI1MjcyNjcuMzY0NDQuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE2MDUwNi5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDw1NEI3QzYzNi00NEJFLTRGRTktODZEQS1DQkI4Qjc3MTA1RDhAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDwxMzQyNTMxNTU2LjE1MjU2LllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWI4MTUwNi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+IDwxMzQyNTQ3NzE1LjYzMDkzLllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWIxMjI1MDMubWFpbC5uZTEueWFob28uY29tPiA8MTM0MjU3NTA1NS42MzQxOS5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViODczMDIubWFpbC5pcmQueWFob28uY29tPiA8MTM0MjU4MjY5NC40MTM3LllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWIxMjI1MDQubWFpbC5uZTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68234,"nextInTopic":68239,"prevInTime":68237,"nextInTime":68239,"topicId":68200,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I honestly don t think smoking is a bad thing.

The drinking age is 18.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Where I live, it&#39;s 21.  I could have told my kids that they should NEVER, ever touch alcohol, not liquor, not beer, not wine, until they were 21.  I didn&#39;t do that.  I  knew they were going to taste it,  maybe even get drunk and puke.   I would rather have a relationship with them that made it safe and comfortable for them to share those stories, and so that I could ask someone else to keep an eye on them (an older sibling or friend) if they were out at a party or camping where there was alcohol.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We have had birthday parties here with alcohol (although I know the laws, and I know the moral dilemma, so it&#39;s okay if people here don&#39;t write and attempt to shame me or change what has already happened and that was done with thought and discussion and care).   There have also been parties of kids old enough to drink where there wasn&#39;t anything more than maybe a little beer, but mostly lots of soda and food and games.   When there have been drinks involved, one or two kids took care of the table and made mixed drinks.  One of their friends became and now is a professional bartender, and if he&#39;s here he organizes those things.  Between parties, the liquor is in the house, but it sits and gets dusty, only to be brought out again in six months or a year when there&#39;s another party.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kirby doesn&#39;t drink much, it seems.  He got a bottle of tequila for his 21st birthday.  He moved to Texas days later, and didn&#39;t even take that unopened bottle of tequila.  It eventually went into drinks at other parties here (maybe Kirby&#39;s, as he&#39;s celebrated a couple of birthdays at home since he left).  Marty has done more drinking than the others.  Now, at 23, he sometimes goes to a bar near us (where his friend is the bartender) for &quot;geeks who drink,&quot; a trivia game.  It&#39;s near enough for him to walk home safely, or if he stays long enough the sober bartender can drive him by.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Holly drank sooner than the others because most of her friends were older, friends of her brothers.

Neither of my parents smoked. I can remember being 10 or  <br/>\nso and declaring to my friends that I would smoke when I grew up. I  <br/>\nalso wanted to get married as soon as possible and get away from my  <br/>\nparents. I decided that I hated them both (my parents) early...before  <br/>\nI was 8 at least. It had a lot to do with the religious rules they  <br/>\nimposed (hypocritically) and   it had to do with the spanking and  <br/>\nshaming and chores and more. I was angry and depressed a lot as a kid,  <br/>\nand not surprisingly, turned into an angry and depressed teenager. And  <br/>\nmy parents divorced. I started smoking when I was 13, the summer  <br/>\nbefore I started high school. I looked older, could buy them (often I  <br/>\nstole money from my parents), and I started hanging with other, older  <br/>\nkids who smoked. I also shoplifted cigarettes on a regular basis. They  <br/>\nused to be in a case by the gum in the grocery checkout (in the late  <br/>\n80s) and not locked up at all. It was easy. My parents hated it and I  <br/>\ngot in trouble about it alot, but I was a pretty dedicated smoker. It  <br/>\nbecame part of my rebellious identity. I enjoyed it very much.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce, in college, I broke up with my live in boyfriend (didnt end up  <br/>\ngetting married early, but this breakup was still pretty much like a  <br/>\ndivorce)<br/>\nand I was smoking more heavily than usual. I remember going to bed at  <br/>\nnight, being so lonely and sad, and wishing I could &quot;smoke to sleep&quot;.  <br/>\nMany years later, when I had babies to nurse to sleep, I made the  <br/>\nconnection that I was really self soothing myself with cigarettes  <br/>\n(especially in that breakup period). I also sucked my thumb until I  <br/>\nwas in fourth or fifth grade, to my parents horror. My mom used to  <br/>\npaint my thumb with icky stuff to try to stop me.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I think I would have smoked if my parents had respected me and  <br/>\nsupported me and been kind and enthusiastic and involved? I doubt I  <br/>\nwould have been so hell bent on it, and I doubt I would have kept  <br/>\ngoing, or been so dependent on them as an identity or to self soothe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI quit the day I gave birth to my daughter. It seemed absurd that I  <br/>\nwould smoke around her, or while nursing her (which I was) and I had  <br/>\nwanted to quit for years. Im completely recovered, I dont even crave  <br/>\nit.

I didn&#39;t. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy dad let me try his cigarette once when we were walking. I must have been 9 or 10 and expressed curiousity. I don&#39;t think it had anything to do with my smoking later. I started smoking at a time when my home life was under intense upheaval. My mom had moved away to work and my dad was gone from the house from early in the morning to late at night. I had moved from the easier, smaller, younger grade in school, to the larger school and more competetive school of junior high, or middle school, or secondary school or whatever it is in Australia, and was hanging with a wilder, faster group of kids. My smoking coincided with my school grades going into a steep decline. I wasn&#39;t smoking because I tasted a cigarette, I was smoking because it was something that was helping me to hook into a support network at a time when my seemingly stable home life was falling apart a bit. <br/>\n <br/>\nI assume you are nervous that buying your daughter cigarettes will make her addicted.

He found that environment played a huge role in the response that rats showed to having addictive substances available. My enviroment sucked when I was 12. It didn&#39;t get better for a long time. When it did get better I stopped smoking and haven&#39;t relapsed in any meaningful way.  That&#39;s what Bruce Alexander found in rats and later in humans. Humans in crap environments will smoke, drink, use drugs, gamble, whatever it is that makes the crap less crappy, the stress less intense. Humans will self-medicate. When situations get better, when the environment changes, like returning from the Vietnam war, humans will<br/>\n stop using the drugs, go through the physical withdrawal symptoms, the hell that is separating from the addiction, and return to a life without that self-medication. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe best thing that any parent can do is to make their life with and their relationship with their children as good and as happy and as stress-free as possible. That way they will be less likely to feel a need to medicate their way out of the misery and stress that makes up their day to day lives. <br/>\n <br/>\nI would buy Simon and Linnaea cigarettes if they were curious.

I started because I lacked confidence and wanted to feel tough and part of a &#39;rebel&#39; kind of peer group. Then it became an addiction and part of my identity - I was a smoker. Smoking was very much a part of my social life as a teenager and young adult. In those days (late 80s through to late 90s) smoking did not carry the social stigma it carries today, and smoking was allowed in pubs and nightclubs. I quit at the age of 27 while back-packing - in Europe cigarettes were cheap and everybody smoked, but when we got to the UK, tobacco was heavily taxed and would have blown our meagre travelling budget. So that was it. I had to change my identity to become a non-smoker. I told myself over and over that I no longer wanted to pay evil multi-national companies to slowly kill myself ;) It worked though, and I&#39;ve never had the desire for another cigarette, and find the smoke repulsive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had a teenager who wanted to try a cigarette I&#39;d help them, because in the context of unschooling, their desire would probably be one of experimentation.

I build up every day the kind of loving, connected relationship that will allow them to be open with me (as I was not with my mother) about their desire to try something. I support their choices and desires every day so that they feel loved and valued as unique individuals.

My dad smoked cigars when I was very little, until I was maybe 5, and hid it from my mum. The subject of smoking was not to be discussed in a two way conversation, and we were left in no doubt that it was forbidden. I, however, started smoking at 14 whenever I had nights at friends&#39; houses (we would go out around the estate, or from 15 onwards to the pub once we could pass for 18) and also in school lunch breaks we would sneak out of school and smoke.

Sometimes I&#39;d smoke maybe two packs the day before I was due to go home, and my first thought when I or back would always be when I could next sneak away.

The drinking age is 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere I live, it&#39;s 21.  I could have told my kids that they should NEVER, ever touch alcohol, not liquor, not beer, not wine, until they were 21.  I didn&#39;t do that.  I  knew they were going to taste it,  maybe even get drunk and puke.   I would rather have a relationship with them that made it safe and comfortable for them to share those stories, and so that I could ask someone else to keep an eye on them (an older sibling or friend) if they were out at a party or camping where there was alcohol.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had birthday parties here with alcohol (although I know the laws, and I know the moral dilemma, so it&#39;s okay if people here don&#39;t write and attempt to shame me or change what has already happened and that was done with thought and discussion and care).   There have also been parties of kids old enough to drink where there wasn&#39;t anything more than maybe a little beer, but mostly lots of soda and food and games.   When there have been drinks involved, one or two kids took care of the table and made mixed drinks.  One of their friends became and now is a professional bartender, and if he&#39;s here he organizes those things.  Between parties, the liquor is in the house, but it sits and gets dusty, only to be brought out again in six months or a year when there&#39;s another party.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby doesn&#39;t drink much, it seems.  He got a bottle of tequila for his 21st birthday.  He moved to Texas days later, and didn&#39;t even take that unopened bottle of tequila.  It eventually went into drinks at other parties here (maybe Kirby&#39;s, as he&#39;s celebrated a couple of birthdays at home since he left).  Marty has done more drinking than the others.  Now, at 23, he sometimes goes to a bar near us (where his friend is the bartender) for &quot;geeks who drink,&quot; a trivia game.  It&#39;s near enough for him to walk home safely, or if he stays long enough the sober bartender can drive him by.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly drank sooner than the others because most of her friends were older, friends of her brothers.  She drank where her brothers were, generally, and they always either had arranged to stay where they were or had a designated driver, or Keith and I were aware it was that sort of party and were available to pick them up if necessary.  We have never been called to pick anyone up, though we have a few times gone the next day to pick up the automobile they left at the party when they got a ride home from a safe driver.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Teens and Smoking","postDate":"1342521666","msgId":68205,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NkRDRTUwLUYzQkQtNDAzMS1CRjM4LUZBRjY3Qjc0NTExNUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGp1MzZucCtzbzg0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGp1MzZucCtzbzg0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68204,"nextInTopic":68206,"prevInTime":68204,"nextInTime":68206,"topicId":68200,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Or do you think she saw you as the queen of subject changing, accepted that as a &quot;No&quot; and also as &quot;I won&#39;t even respond to your questions about cigarettes,&quot; and now she will ask someone else to buy her cigarettes?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to buy her a pack to let her try one.  You could borrow or trade for or buy a cigarette from a friend or stranger who smokes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne cigarette will not do as much damage to her as having a mother who doesn&#39;t know how to talk to her openly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad you&#39;re asking the question here, and I hope the next time she asks something if you can&#39;t think of an answer right away you could say &quot;Let me think about it a bit.&quot;    Dodging and ducking aren&#39;t verbal communication, but they are communication.  If you reached out to touch her gently and she softened toward it, that would be a different communication than if she flinched back quickly and looked disturbed.  There are things in between those.  Stiffening but accepting the touch briefly.  Hugging you.  Leaving the room huffily.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she reached out to touch you verbally, you stiffened and turned away (no words in return).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could go and talk to her and say that when she asked you were surprised, and didn&#39;t think of an answer, but that you don&#39;t want to ignore the question because you want her to communicate with you more, and not less.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then, if you really believe that, you will need to work on making choices when you speak, and not reciting the script of the controlling parents around you, and not default to things your mother would have said to you, but honestly and thoughtfully consider alternatives with each phrase and word.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be harder the first time than the second time.  It will be easier the tenth time than the ninth time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/choices\">http://sandradodd.com/choices</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":47675473,"authorName":"michelle_mcritchie","from":"&quot;michelle_mcritchie&quot; &lt;karlskeys@...&gt;","profile":"michelle_mcritchie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Teens and Smoking","postDate":"1342512697","msgId":68200,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGp1MzZucCtzbzg0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":68204,"prevInTime":68199,"nextInTime":68201,"topicId":68200,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All, Second message to the group and I seem to be starting with the heavy subjects .
