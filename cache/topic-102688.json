He likes to talk to me  late <br/>\nat night and tell me secrets.  He was telling me about playing on  Sunday with <br/>\nkids around the corner, whom we know from baseball.  I was at  work on <br/>\nSunday, so he had a day to think about it.  Their mother is a  teacher.  Will didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow that Monday was MLK day, because it just hadn&#39;t  come up, yet, although <br/>\nhe&#39;s known about it in other years.  Kyle, who is 6,  said that the reason <br/>\nWill didn&#39;t know that was because he doesn&#39;t go to  school.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWill was sooo kind about it.  He prefaced the story by saying he KNEW  Kyle <br/>\nwas only 6.  But it stung him, and he didn&#39;t have an answer,  really.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThen Will told me about something that happened with Payton during baseball  <br/>\nseason.  Will asked him &quot;What&#39;s today?&quot;  (a question I ask myself and  others <br/>\nseveral times every day) and Payton said, &quot;you don&#39;t know that because  you <br/>\ndon&#39;t go to school!&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nWill told me he knows those kids don&#39;t know any better, because they go to  <br/>\nschool.  &lt;BEG&gt;  But he said it still hurts him.  I reminded  him that he&#39;d been <br/>\nto the Lorraine Motel where MLK was assassinated and he saw  the lady who <br/>\nlives on the street in front of it because they took her home when  they made it <br/>\na museum, and that he knew more real things about MLK from being  born and <br/>\nraised in Memphis than Kyle would every hope to know.  And that  he&#39;s even sat on <br/>\nDad&#39;s shoulders during the MLK parade on Front Street.   Kyle thinks it&#39;s <br/>\nimportant because he gets a day off from school--how  much can he really know <br/>\nwhen there aren&#39;t even any black children in his  classroom?  <br/>\n <br/>\nWill is so gentle and non-aggressive.  Both of these kids are in  highly <br/>\ncompetitive families, and nothing but winning in all ways is ever good  enough.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t help Will to have that information in the moment, though.   I have <br/>\nhesitated for years to show him how to interact with people who  have <br/>\nconventional ideas about school.  I didn&#39;t want to poison him,  you know?  And it <br/>\nhadn&#39;t really been an issue until now.  He fully  believes that school is not <br/>\nnecessary, but I think I&#39;ve hindered him by not  giving him tools to interact <br/>\nwith that mindset.  Finally I have told him to  make things up, which is what it <br/>\namounts to, in his mind.  Kyle said  something about Will having no school, <br/>\nand I encouraged Will to just say that  his home is his school.  That for these <br/>\npeople, in this area, he&#39;s  going to have to speak language that people <br/>\nunderstand.  Lie, obfuscate,  obscure the beautiful truth of his life, so he can <br/>\navoid the slings and  arrows.  <br/>\n <br/>\nEither that or become more aggressive and competitive and be a one-upper  and <br/>\nnanny-nanny boo-boo over how much he knows about MLK.  I don&#39;t want  that.  I <br/>\nwant the gentle Will who would rather have fun and play than argue  over who <br/>\nis smarter. Who makes concessions for being 6.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSometimes I think this misinformation is coming from the parents, and I  <br/>\nbriefly considered writing a letter to the editor about it.  It would have  an <br/>\nimpact in this small town.  But nah, I&#39;ll just help Will, instead.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102699,"nextTopicId":102706}}
