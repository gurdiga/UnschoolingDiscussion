Unfortunately, they don&#39;t.  I<br/>\nhave to agree with Ned that unschooling is, to a certain extent, good<br/>\nparenting.  But many children don&#39;t enjoy the benefits of good parenting.<br/>\nMany spend time in preschool and/or daycare, which I also wouldn&#39;t consider<br/>\nunschooling environments.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think how I feel about homeschooling changed when my son hit kindergarten<br/>\nage; I felt like there was a bit more pressure to &quot;do it right&quot;.  (Hence I<br/>\ncame looking for a nice email list to reassure me that maybe what I was<br/>\ndoing WAS &quot;right&quot;!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I felt extremely isolated when my son was 3 and 4 years old.  The<br/>\nhomeschoolers told me he was &quot;too young&quot;, but virtually everybody had put<br/>\ntheir kids in preschool at that age, and a fair number of the mothers I knew<br/>\nhad gone back to work.  I didn&#39;t fit in anywhere.  So I can relate to folks<br/>\nwho say they unschool from birth.  At least they can feel that they fit in<br/>\nsomewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40945,"nextTopicId":40878}}
