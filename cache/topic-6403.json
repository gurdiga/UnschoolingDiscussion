It has become a thing with the neighbours boy as<br/>\nwell.... and they are all here at my house building toy guns out of lego.<br/>\nThe only real guideline I have given is &quot;no shooting at people&quot; but I still<br/>\nfeel sick to my stomach when I watch them making gun noises and &quot;playing&quot;<br/>\nwith them.  (And by the way spouting off a surprisingly vast body of<br/>\nknouledge about different kinds etc.)<br/>\n    I have talked to my boys often about how guns are tools for either<br/>\nprotection or hunting, or weapons of war, but definately not toys.  But<br/>\nshort of making a no-holds barred rule of &quot;no toy guns of any sort&quot; I am<br/>\nfiguring I will have to just accept their gun play as more of my problem<br/>\nthan theirs.  We also don&#39;t have any &quot;real&quot; toy guns which I think helps a<br/>\nlot.  I would greatly appreciate hearing how other families have dealt with<br/>\nthis issue...<br/>\n    Has anyone gone the rout of taking up guns as an topic to study more in<br/>\ndepth??</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6400,"nextTopicId":6390}}
