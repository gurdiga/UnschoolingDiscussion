You start your first<br/>\n&gt; paragraph by joining two people who are in extremely differing circumstances. The<br/>\n&gt; first is a confirmed murderess of her own children. The second has never had the<br/>\n&gt; charges against her substantiated. <br/>\n&gt; In your next paragraph, you identify homeschooling as a socially isolating<br/>\n&gt; situation. Most of the homeschooling families I personally know have lots of<br/>\n&gt; differing social situations going on. In an average week in our home, maybe one or<br/>\n&gt; two days are spent at home without social contact.The remainder we engage in<br/>\n&gt; varying activities, such as soccer or baseball teams, summer camp, Royal<br/>\n&gt; Rangers(similar to Boy Scouts),field trips, the library, visiting and helping<br/>\n&gt; neighbors, learning life skills like shopping and interacting with business people<br/>\n&gt; in the community.<br/>\n&gt; Your next statement accuses homeschoolers as having a propaganda machine. Have you<br/>\n&gt; ever listened to many statements of the NEA? Many have said the same of them. <br/>\n&gt; How did you come to the conclusion &quot;modern home-schooling got its start among<br/>\n&gt; left-wing dropouts in the &#39;60s.&quot;? Most of what I have read and studied about the<br/>\n&gt; beginnings of the movement came about at frustration of the public school system<br/>\n&gt; not really educating. You state the current success in testing is probably related<br/>\n&gt; to the affluence and education of parents, but studies have shown education level<br/>\n&gt; and income do not have an impact on home-schoolers&#39; standardized test scores in<br/>\n&gt; any substantial way. there is an organization called National Home Education<br/>\n&gt; Research Institute which has studied this issue and you can learn more by<br/>\n&gt; contacting them at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nheri.org\">http://www.nheri.org</a> for further information. Adversely,<br/>\n&gt; parents of higher education and income tend to have better performing children in<br/>\n&gt; public schools. That has been statistically proven also. <br/>\n&gt; You question the motives of homeschooling parents and give two possible values,<br/>\n&gt; either we are protecting our children from the outside world or can&#39;t get along<br/>\n&gt; with others. I refute that statement. I think the public school system is absurd<br/>\n&gt; in what it teaches and how it teaches. I want my children to be able to relate and<br/>\n&gt; communicate with people of all ages and social classes, not just their immediate<br/>\n&gt; peers. I want them to learn life skills they can really use as adults, not to feel<br/>\n&gt; like everyone else controls their time and what they do. I want my children to be<br/>\n&gt; able to question and reason so their convictions and beliefs are theirs, not fed<br/>\n&gt; to them by someone else. I am sorry a few bad examples have left a foul taste in<br/>\n&gt; your mouth, but I know of many more public school abuses that are just as tragic<br/>\n&gt; and violent as the ones you have cited and the public school system and social<br/>\n&gt; service agencies were not the white knight you seem to think they are. For<br/>\n&gt; example, high school children forced to be strip searched as part of a jail field<br/>\n&gt; trip,  teachers exchanging a young girl&#39;s virginity for grades, or teachers<br/>\n&gt; trading sexual relationships for murder. Most home-schoolers love their children<br/>\n&gt; and want them to succeed in life whatever roads they choose. Don&#39;t try to deny<br/>\n&gt; many the freedom to do good because of a few poor examples you consider failures. <br/>\n&gt; Johanna <br/>\n&gt; Life is the ultimate learning experience!<br/>\n&gt; Johanna <br/>\n&gt; Life is the ultimate learning experience!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Johanna","from":"&quot;Johanna&quot; &lt;saninocencio1@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"2YEuDTGTdMID1-tAyX88uvB6YaCUdFx5gchD1UXH1neJFkZXIxrUW1FugBjjsFb44zWMcX7bB-KUgm0VoizrUCWwO3N0y-qwTFAB7A","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Seattle Times Editorial","postDate":"994047713","msgId":22789,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjcwMWMxMDJhZSQ4NzM3NTUwMCQ1MzdlZDdhYUBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22791,"prevInTime":22788,"nextInTime":22790,"topicId":22789,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"below is the response I sent to Froma Harrop and the Seattle Times.
