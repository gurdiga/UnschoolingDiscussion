So sorry), I saw the<br/>\nbenefits<br/>\n&gt; of what he was trying to convey with the IDEA of living in the real world<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; opposed to schooling at home or HOMEschooling. But I cringed throughout<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; piece. It *could* be that I&#39;m an atheist in the heart of the Bible Belt.<br/>\n&lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It *could* be that because of my geographical location I&#39;m just a bit more<br/>\n&gt; hypersensitive to &quot;fundie-speak&quot; than the average Joe. Could be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But even as I read it, I knew that I could probably send it to my in-laws<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; that it might strike a cord with them. I won&#39;t, though. I couldn&#39;t in good<br/>\n&gt; faith promote *anything* along those lines. Remove the bigotry, the<br/>\nhatred, the<br/>\n&gt; euphemisms, and the bold-face religious aspect, and it might work for me.<br/>\n&gt; Like I said, the overall message is good---it&#39;s the underlying CRAP that<br/>\ndoes it<br/>\n&gt; in!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But this guy has an agenda. He also leaves his website available so that<br/>\n&gt; unsuspecting folks will wander in and maybe &quot;see the light&quot; (just like<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n&gt; does----it&#39;s not ALL evil! &lt;G&gt;). On the bright side, I guess it *could*<br/>\nhelp the<br/>\n&gt; fundies see that they DON&#39;T have to worship Bob Jones and Abeka and<br/>\nSonlight<br/>\n&gt; and that it *could* help their children to have happier, more joyful<br/>\nlives. So<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve got to give him that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t believe that the article was written for *US*; his audience is<br/>\nreally<br/>\n&gt; right-wing, fundamentalist Christians who (in my opinion) DO need to<br/>\nlighten<br/>\n&gt; up and see that learning exists in the great, big, wild, wide world<br/>\n(although<br/>\n&gt; he might argue that the world shouldn&#39;t be *that* great*, *that* big,<br/>\n*that*<br/>\n&gt; wild, or *that* wide!). But I&#39;ll give him credit for trying to open up<br/>\ntheir<br/>\n&gt; &quot;schooling&quot; world a bit!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;ll rewrite it to be more &quot;unschoolingly politically correct&quot;. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nYou<br/>\n&gt; notice he NEVER used that word, &quot;unschooling&quot;----it would put off too many<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; his audience members!  I&#39;ll work on that today and see whether it can be<br/>\n&gt; fixed. Until then, I&#39;ll definitely refrain from sending it on!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Kelly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 2<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 27 Oct 2003 09:50:15 EST<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: intense focus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I can&#39;t understand why a child would claim to be addicted to<br/>\nsomething,<br/>\n&gt; unless they somehow got the idea from someone else that they shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt; spending so much time on that activity or that that activity is somehow a<br/>\n&gt; negative thing.

Horses: their training, handling, grooming, racing,<br/>\ntack, and<br/>\n&gt; showing. Travel. Food, parties, and entertaining. Remodeling and<br/>\ndecorating old<br/>\n&gt; houses. Gardening. Ancient civilizations and sociology. Astronomy.  And<br/>\nland<br/>\n&gt; searching. And beekeeping and alpacas. Unschooling is my main focus<br/>\nnow---and I<br/>\n&gt; had to throw myself into conferences for a while. Occasionally to the<br/>\n&gt; detriment of other, more minor, things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Focus is HARD for many people. And I think that maybe THEY see focus as an<br/>\n&gt; addiction.

Sitting at the<br/>\ncomputer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; playing a stinking game while I was waiting for her to get her pjs on so<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could read to her in my bed.

One correct answer is &#39;being with Megan and<br/>\nloving this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; child who right at this moment needed something other than a big fat<br/>\npinch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on the arm&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And another answer is doing something you love to do, like brewing a<br/>\nstrong<br/>\n&gt; cup of coffee or reading a few pages of a book you love or yes, being at<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; computer, venting a minute.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In another post, Joyce asked me what personal boundaries I was trying to<br/>\nset<br/>\n&gt; -- this was in relation to the&quot; I&#39;m on the verge of requiring bedtimes&quot;<br/>\n&gt; thread.  And what you&#39;ve (bravely and honestly) described here is the<br/>\nsituation I<br/>\n&gt; need to avoid, because we&#39;ve been there before.

Some alone time at the end of the day is one thing I need to do for<br/>\n&gt; myself -- some time to think my own thoughts.

Here many HSers do<br/>\nfollow<br/>\n&gt; a religion and would benefit from relaxing and I agree this article was<br/>\n&gt; saying just that to them.<br/>\n&gt; I should not have forwarded it to this list and NO I dont think many if<br/>\nany<br/>\n&gt; on this list need the sting (to relax) from a religious end. I do however<br/>\nthink<br/>\n&gt; that those who know others may benefit from some of the comments<br/>\nespecially<br/>\n&gt; the curriculum part.

So sorry), I saw the<br/>\n&gt; benefits<br/>\n&gt; of what he was trying to convey with the IDEA of living in the real world<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; opposed to schooling at home or HOMEschooling. But I cringed throughout<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; piece. It *could* be that I&#39;m an atheist in the heart of the Bible Belt.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It *could* be that because of my geographical location I&#39;m just a bit more<br/>\n&gt; hypersensitive to &quot;fundie-speak&quot; than the average Joe. Could be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But even as I read it, I knew that I could probably send it to my in-laws<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; that it might strike a cord with them. I won&#39;t, though. I couldn&#39;t in good<br/>\n&gt; faith promote *anything* along those lines. Remove the bigotry, the<br/>\nhatred,<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; euphemisms, and the bold-face religious aspect, and it might work for me.<br/>\n&gt; Like I said, the overall message is good---it&#39;s the underlying CRAP that<br/>\ndoes<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; in!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But this guy has an agenda. He also leaves his website available so that<br/>\n&gt; unsuspecting folks will wander in and maybe &quot;see the light&quot; (just like<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n&gt; does----it&#39;s not ALL evil! &lt;G&gt;). On the bright side, I guess it *could*<br/>\nhelp<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; fundies see that they DON&#39;T have to worship Bob Jones and Abeka and<br/>\nSonlight<br/>\n&gt; and that it *could* help their children to have happier, more joyful<br/>\nlives.<br/>\n&gt; So<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve got to give him that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t believe that the article was written for *US*; his audience is<br/>\nreally<br/>\n&gt; right-wing, fundamentalist Christians who (in my opinion) DO need to<br/>\nlighten<br/>\n&gt; up and see that learning exists in the great, big, wild, wide world<br/>\n(although<br/>\n&gt; he might argue that the world shouldn&#39;t be *that* great*, *that* big,<br/>\n*that*<br/>\n&gt; wild, or *that* wide!). But I&#39;ll give him credit for trying to open up<br/>\ntheir<br/>\n&gt; &quot;schooling&quot; world a bit!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;ll rewrite it to be more &quot;unschoolingly politically correct&quot;. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nYou<br/>\n&gt; notice he NEVER used that word, &quot;unschooling&quot;----it would put off too many<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; his audience members!  I&#39;ll work on that today and see whether it can be<br/>\n&gt; fixed.

Homeschooling parents can save lots<br/>\n&gt; of time since there are so many courses they don&#39;t have to teach.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They don&#39;t have to teach multiculturalism, the peculiar notion that<br/>\n&gt; other cultures should be preferred to our own, or teach a course in<br/>\n&gt; Islam, such as is now taught in California schools.  Homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; parents are free to teach that their religion and their country are the<br/>\n&gt; best.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Homeschooling parents do not have to teach political correctness, such<br/>\n&gt; as the dogma that all academic subjects must be taught through the<br/>\n&gt; prism of gender and race oppression.  They are free to teach that<br/>\n&gt; America is not a land of victims but a country of freedom and<br/>\n&gt; opportunity for all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Homeschooing parents do not have to teach the androgyny demanded by<br/>\n&gt; radical feminism.  They are free to teach boys and girls separately and<br/>\n&gt; differently and let their boys enjoy plenty of recess to work off their<br/>\n&gt; excess energy and avoid giving them Ritalin to make them behave like<br/>\n&gt; girls.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Homeschoolers do not have to take a course every year in Diversity, the<br/>\n&gt; code word for gay rights, as is now mandated K-12 by the California<br/>\n&gt; State Legislature.  Parent educators are free to teach that it is OK to<br/>\n&gt; be judgmental about illegal and immoral acts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Homeschooling parents don&#39;t have to teach revisionist history that<br/>\n&gt; deletes mention of Washington, Jefferson and Franklin, as the New<br/>\n&gt; Jersey State Department of Education tried to do, but had to back down<br/>\n&gt; after a parental uproar.  Homeschoolers have academic freedom to study<br/>\n&gt; the Founding Fathers and read the writings of the DWEMs (Dead White<br/>\n&gt; European Males) who contributed so much to Western Civilization.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Homeschoolers do not have to study global education that is designed to<br/>\n&gt; promote global interdependence and citizens of the world instead of the<br/>\n&gt; U.S.A.  Homeschooling parents do not have to teach Environmental<br/>\n&gt; Education fantasies such as that humans exist to serve the earth<br/>\n&gt; instead of vice versa.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Homeschoolers don&#39;t have to study fuzzy math, whole math, new math, new<br/>\n&gt; new math, or rainforest math.  They won&#39;t waste math time discussing,<br/>\n&gt; coloring, playing games, or telling their parents how good they feel<br/>\n&gt; about incorrect answers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Homeschooled children will learn to read using authentic phonics as<br/>\n&gt; their first order of business, so they won&#39;t have to take remedial<br/>\n&gt; reading after three years of failure.  They won&#39;t be inflicted with<br/>\n&gt; Whole Language, which fraudulently teaches children to guess at words<br/>\n&gt; from the pictures, skip over difficult words, and substitute any words<br/>\n&gt; that seem to fit the context.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Homeschoolers will save lots of time because they don&#39;t have to read<br/>\n&gt; typical middle school assignments of depressing modern fiction by<br/>\n&gt; &quot;nobody&quot; authors writing about drugs, violence, sex, runaway teens,<br/>\n&gt; witchcraft, and other depressing subjects.  Homeschoolers can read<br/>\n&gt; books about heroes and stories that build character, courage,<br/>\n&gt; patriotism, and virtue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Homeschoolers won&#39;t have to spend time filling out nosy questionnaires<br/>\n&gt; about sex, drugs and suicide.  The public schools are obsessed with<br/>\n&gt; asking students impudent personal questions such as how many times have<br/>\n&gt; you felt depressed and tried to commit suicide.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are many more worthless courses taught in public schools on which<br/>\n&gt; homeschoolers will not spend their precious time, such as courses in<br/>\n&gt; murder (forensics is the latest fad), suicide, death and dying,<br/>\n&gt; evolution, and self-esteem.  Homeschooled students won&#39;t have any<br/>\n&gt; problem with self-esteem because their self-esteem will be earned by<br/>\n&gt; achievement in mastering the important truths of history, literature,<br/>\n&gt; math and science.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Monday, October 27, 2003, at 09:51  AM, Tia Leschke wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Tia, Why is that?

Very corrected, all that is too old mind<br/>\nstuff.  My dd is very much too active to do dishes or cook or any &quot; girl<br/>\nstuff&quot;  much like her mom.  Stepheny<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Here is some of what Phyllis Schlafly has to say about homeschooling<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2002/june02/02-06-05.shtml\">http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2002/june02/02-06-05.shtml</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   It takes uncommon commitment by parents to undertake a homeschool<br/>\n&gt;   regimen, but they soon discover they can do in a couple of hours what<br/>\n&gt;   takes all day at regular school.  Homeschooling parents can save lots<br/>\n&gt;   of time since there are so many courses they don&#39;t have to teach.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   They don&#39;t have to teach multiculturalism, the peculiar notion that<br/>\n&gt;   other cultures should be preferred to our own, or teach a course in<br/>\n&gt;   Islam, such as is now taught in California schools.  Homeschooling<br/>\n&gt;   parents are free to teach that their religion and their country are the<br/>\n&gt;   best.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Homeschooling parents do not have to teach political correctness, such<br/>\n&gt;   as the dogma that all academic subjects must be taught through the<br/>\n&gt;   prism of gender and race oppression.  They are free to teach that<br/>\n&gt;   America is not a land of victims but a country of freedom and<br/>\n&gt;   opportunity for all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Homeschooing parents do not have to teach the androgyny demanded by<br/>\n&gt;   radical feminism.  They are free to teach boys and girls separately and<br/>\n&gt;   differently and let their boys enjoy plenty of recess to work off their<br/>\n&gt;   excess energy and avoid giving them Ritalin to make them behave like<br/>\n&gt;   girls.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Homeschoolers do not have to take a course every year in Diversity, the<br/>\n&gt;   code word for gay rights, as is now mandated K-12 by the California<br/>\n&gt;   State Legislature.  Parent educators are free to teach that it is OK to<br/>\n&gt;   be judgmental about illegal and immoral acts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Homeschooling parents don&#39;t have to teach revisionist history that<br/>\n&gt;   deletes mention of Washington, Jefferson and Franklin, as the New<br/>\n&gt;   Jersey State Department of Education tried to do, but had to back down<br/>\n&gt;   after a parental uproar.  Homeschoolers have academic freedom to study<br/>\n&gt;   the Founding Fathers and read the writings of the DWEMs (Dead White<br/>\n&gt;   European Males) who contributed so much to Western Civilization.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Homeschoolers do not have to study global education that is designed to<br/>\n&gt;   promote global interdependence and citizens of the world instead of the<br/>\n&gt;   U.S.A.  Homeschooling parents do not have to teach Environmental<br/>\n&gt;   Education fantasies such as that humans exist to serve the earth<br/>\n&gt;   instead of vice versa.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Homeschoolers don&#39;t have to study fuzzy math, whole math, new math, new<br/>\n&gt;   new math, or rainforest math.  They won&#39;t waste math time discussing,<br/>\n&gt;   coloring, playing games, or telling their parents how good they feel<br/>\n&gt;   about incorrect answers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Homeschooled children will learn to read using authentic phonics as<br/>\n&gt;   their first order of business, so they won&#39;t have to take remedial<br/>\n&gt;   reading after three years of failure.  They won&#39;t be inflicted with<br/>\n&gt;   Whole Language, which fraudulently teaches children to guess at words<br/>\n&gt;   from the pictures, skip over difficult words, and substitute any words<br/>\n&gt;   that seem to fit the context.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Homeschoolers will save lots of time because they don&#39;t have to read<br/>\n&gt;   typical middle school assignments of depressing modern fiction by<br/>\n&gt;   &quot;nobody&quot; authors writing about drugs, violence, sex, runaway teens,<br/>\n&gt;   witchcraft, and other depressing subjects.  Homeschoolers can read<br/>\n&gt;   books about heroes and stories that build character, courage,<br/>\n&gt;   patriotism, and virtue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Homeschoolers won&#39;t have to spend time filling out nosy questionnaires<br/>\n&gt;   about sex, drugs and suicide.  The public schools are obsessed with<br/>\n&gt;   asking students impudent personal questions such as how many times have<br/>\n&gt;   you felt depressed and tried to commit suicide.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   There are many more worthless courses taught in public schools on which<br/>\n&gt;   homeschoolers will not spend their precious time, such as courses in<br/>\n&gt;   murder (forensics is the latest fad), suicide, death and dying,<br/>\n&gt;   evolution, and self-esteem.  Homeschooled students won&#39;t have any<br/>\n&gt;   problem with self-esteem because their self-esteem will be earned by<br/>\n&gt;   achievement in mastering the important truths of history, literature,<br/>\n&gt;   math and science.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   On Monday, October 27, 2003, at 09:51  AM, Tia Leschke wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;&gt; Tia, Why is that?

It gives us the chance to express to<br/>\n&gt; you the thinking that guides our advertising decisions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The issues involved are tough ones, full of controversy and<br/>\n&gt; emotion.  We take your comments very seriously.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kraft is always concerned about the media environment in which our<br/>\n&gt; advertising appears and we have rigorous policies governing the<br/>\n&gt; placement of our ads.  We enforce ourpolicies to the best of<br/>\n&gt; our ability.  From time to time, we are asked to use the power of our<br/>\n&gt; advertising dollars to intervene in the editorial policies of the<br/>\n&gt; media -- to influence newscoverage on this network or<br/>\n&gt; drive a personality off the air at that station.

It WAS<br/>\n&gt; hard though, at the beginning,  just admitting that I couldn&#39;t (or<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t)<br/>\n&gt; handle it myself.  I was brought up in a family where you never admitted<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; needed help of any kind.  After I had my babies, my parents would come<br/>\nvisit<br/>\n&gt; for the day (to see the new baby) then go home.  Mom said to me; &quot;I know<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; a day or two you&#39;ll be back to your old routine.&quot;  So I always did what<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; expected:  Had my babies on Saturday, came home Sunday, rested on Monday,<br/>\n&gt; then life as usual started on Tuesday.   But I regress....<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, when my second was born, the oldest was 2 1/2.  My DH was working<br/>\n60<br/>\n&gt; hours/week and traveling a LOT.  After 2 months of trying to keep<br/>\neverything<br/>\n&gt; done, I started wearing socks around the house all the time, because I<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t stand all the crud on the floor sticking to my feet.  DH finally<br/>\n&gt; said; &quot;Why don&#39;t we just have someone come in to clean?&quot;  So we did and<br/>\nI&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; never looked back.  I don&#39;t feel too guilty about it because the money I<br/>\n&gt; spend saves me time that I can spend with the kids, and Maya gets more<br/>\ndone<br/>\n&gt; in three hours than I could do in twice that time with all the kids around<br/>\n.<br/>\n&gt; Also, even if you have someone in to clean, there&#39;s still lots of cleaning<br/>\n&gt; to be done by the family.  You might want to try just once a month.  It<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; gives you a week off and that could help with getting caught up with other<br/>\n&gt; projects like cleaning out closets, or the refrigerator, basement, etc...<br/>\n&gt; As for what other people might think.....you&#39;re an unschooler.  You have<br/>\n&gt; already proven you can swim against the current.  If other people son&#39;t<br/>\nlike<br/>\n&gt; it, they&#39;re probably just jealous!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Marjorie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S.  Around here the going rate is more like $20/hour.  Good luck finding<br/>\n&gt; someone cheaper!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 25<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 28 Oct 2003 14:06:28 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;sonyacurti&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcurtielectric@...\">jcurtielectric@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Searching for words<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi to all you very wise women,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know this isn&#39;t my problem (right now) but I am connect so I<br/>\n&gt; thought I would share this with all of you in hopes you could<br/>\n&gt; enlighten me with some inspiring words.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My husband called his ex-wifes house to talk to the children. His ex-<br/>\n&gt; wife was at the her the end of her ropes with the children (both<br/>\n&gt; boys 15 and 11) who are doing horribly in school. She was looking<br/>\n&gt; for my husband to rescue her and like I said many times before to<br/>\n&gt; both of them is all I can do is offer to keep the boys with me to<br/>\n&gt; homeschool (unschool)them with my 7 year old son. Of course they are<br/>\n&gt; still trying to grasp the whole concept of homeschool so I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; scare them with the word unschool as of yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of course my husband would want nothing more than to have them here<br/>\n&gt; but his ex-wife is dead against it (right now anyway). She wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get all that lovely $$ support (another story - another list). As<br/>\n&gt; for me I know they could benifit just from being out of the school<br/>\n&gt; system and it would be a BIG ADJUSTMENT but I am sure it would be a<br/>\n&gt; learning exsperoence for all. I would be willing to take on the<br/>\n&gt; challange though.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have gone through this before this many tmes and life just goes<br/>\n&gt; on and on.  This time she said to my husband that she wants all four<br/>\n&gt; of us to get together and talk. I say to my husband I whole<br/>\n&gt; different philosophy on school and education why the hell would you<br/>\n&gt; want to get together and talk with me or why would I want to talk<br/>\n&gt; with you ???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I was wondering if you had any suggestions. I thought all I<br/>\n&gt; can do is offer my life style and what I believe in and they can do<br/>\n&gt; what they want with it.  Does anyone have any complicated blended<br/>\n&gt; family stories to share about unschooling ?? Does anyone unschool<br/>\n&gt; their stepchildren at all ?? I thought if she is desparate she might<br/>\n&gt; take me up on the offer.  I know she would never dream of doing it<br/>\n&gt; herself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you ,<br/>\n&gt; Sonya<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
