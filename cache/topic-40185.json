We discussed nutrition, protein, balanced diets, etc.  Our family has<br/>\n  never been heavy meat eaters, so it&#39;s not a huge transition, although it<br/>\n  does require a bit more planning.  It&#39;s been about a month, and still going<br/>\n  strong.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The problem?  The reactions from absolutely everybody.  The doctor tried to<br/>\n  tell him he MUST eat meat, until I cut him off (time for a new doctor.<br/>\n  gotta work on the army on that one.).  His friends don&#39;t care, but their<br/>\n  parents laugh at him, about him, treat it like it&#39;s a silly little phase or<br/>\n  something abhorant.  We had an family BBQ with army folks my dh works with,<br/>\n  and people acted like we&#39;re wrong for not just making him eat meat, and must<br/>\n  have no control as parents.  All this for taking a child seriously?!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I truly believe I&#39;m doing the right thing here.  But my best friend just<br/>\n  told me how stupid I&#39;m being about this (by &quot;humoring him&quot;-- her words, not<br/>\n  mine), and I need some support.  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n  brenda<br/>\n  who&#39;s trying to remember somebody&#39;s tag line, &quot;what you think of me is none<br/>\n  of my business&quot;, but having a hard time with it today....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you have questions, concerns or problems with this list, please email the Moderator, Joyce Fetteroll, at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
