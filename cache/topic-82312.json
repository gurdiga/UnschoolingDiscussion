Anyone who&#39;s done much reading about the <br/>\nRenaissance knows there were marriages arranged using miniature paintings of the <br/>\npeople and recommendations of friends.  In the 19th century and early 20th, letter <br/>\nwriting was a big deal and there were courtships on paper, following intros by <br/>\nfriends.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, an e-mail list isn&#39;t as likely a meeting place as chatrooms, and <br/>\nchatrooms abound where more people are lying than telling the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND... the way to woo someone to another state is not to start talking about <br/>\nhow you&#39;re having sex with your boyfriend and your parents know.   How <br/>\nalluring is THAT!?  She&#39;s already partnered up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way luring someone works is you find someone needy, lonely, unattended <br/>\nto, and you tell her she&#39;s the only one who really understands you.  If she&#39;s <br/>\nfrustrated with her family you spin fantasy yarns about how she shouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nrestricted and ignored like that, and it&#39;s too bad her parents don&#39;t love her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes an initial neediness to be victimized by such things, and it&#39;s not <br/>\nsex talk that lures young girls out of their homes.  It&#39;s &quot;oh I understand.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone want to propose being alarmed if kids teens discuss home <br/>\nsituations and restrictions and levels of happiness?

My <br/>\ndaughter prefers to be around moms who respect the kids. My daughter has <br/>\ntwo friends whose mothers closely monitor their email. One simply rarely <br/>\nuses email.

And while we all have varying degrees of comfort levels <br/>\non that subject, talking about sex is a good way for teens to explore and <br/>\ndiscover. I don&#39;t know that I would want MY kids going around saying that they <br/>\nare *free to have sex* in public forums, but I certainly do want them to feel <br/>\nfree to talk with their peers and Darin and I about their sexuality in a safe, <br/>\nexcepting environment. It is important to me that my kids know who they are and <br/>\nthat includes who they are sexually. I think that if they (any child) can <br/>\ntalk about sex and what they want in life, then they are more likely to have <br/>\nmeaningful encounters in all areas including their sexual encounters. I am happy <br/>\nto see that your daughter feels comfortable enough to come to you with her own <br/>\nconcerns.
