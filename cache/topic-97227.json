(Or crackers, or in <br/>\ncelery, or with a spoon or eaten with a popsicle stick or however your kid might <br/>\nlike it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s contribution to our family regulars:<br/>\npeanut butter and cream cheese sandwiches.<br/>\nblock cream cheese works best.  Slice it thin, cover one slice of bread with <br/>\npeanut butter, the other with honey, put cream cheese slices on.  Sliced green <br/>\nseedless grapes make it heavenly and moist enough you might not need a drink <br/>\nwith it, even.  Slice them in three or four so not every slice has the skin, <br/>\nas that&#39;s hard for little kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen making pancakes, thin down the last bit and make a few thin enough you <br/>\ncan put cream cheese and roll them up.  Holly likes strawberry cream cheese in <br/>\nbuttermilk pancakes.  They&#39;re good hot or cold.<br/>\n<br/>\nmonkey platter (inspired by a visit to the zoo when Marty was two or three):<br/>\n<br/>\na tray with pineapple chunks and some or all of whatever else of this you <br/>\nhave:  <br/>\ncut up hot dogs or ham, apple slices or chunks, cheese cubes, string cheese <br/>\nstrung out smaller, cherries or grapes or watermelon cubes, crackers or tiny <br/>\nbread slices (sometimes we make small loaves when I make bread in the winter).  <br/>\nStick a dozen toothpicks in things here or there, and the kids can eat with <br/>\ntoothpicks.  Good for when you have other kids visiting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nquesadillas<br/>\nflour tortillas, spread refried beans on one, put grated cheese on it, cover <br/>\nwith another tortilla, put it in a toaster oven or microwave until the cheese <br/>\nis melting, cut it up like a pizza, or in little squares.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can put shredded chicken in it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77669557,"authorName":"gailbrocop@aol.com","from":"gailbrocop@...","profile":"gailbatch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Protein Snacks","postDate":"1091547899","msgId":97232,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI3LjQzYWRhNzAyLjJlNDEwY2ZiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":97229,"nextInTopic":97234,"prevInTime":97231,"nextInTime":97233,"topicId":97227,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/3/2004 9:45:09 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...

How about make more protein snacks, new and different, fun, attractive, and just don t have marshmallow","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-265153150\">Sandra said:<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t buy fruit roll-ups and marshmallows?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about make more protein snacks, new and different, fun, attractive, and <br/>\njust don&#39;t have marshmallow anything.<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease give me some more ideas for protein snacks that would be fun and interesting for my family of finicky hypoglycemics. They make my brain hurt trying to come up with them. So far the three year old has expanded her culinary choices to cottage cheese, rolled up lunch meat and peanut butter. Everything else I suggest is on her NO list. She once was a happy eater but not presently. It is all good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t ussually allow any sugar in the house. I know it is difficult to understand but ......... living on the road full time as we do and being at music festivals on a weekly basis exposes her to others ways of eating more. I have much less control over our environment. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe marshmellows were acquired around a fire where kids were roasting and gave her a bag. I do not feel comfortable saying no. I do feel comfortable negotiating with her about having some protein and watching the sugar intake. The fruit snacks are an alternative to the jelly beans, chocolate bars, cotton candy, candy apples, kettle corn yada yada yada that surrounds her little life almost daily. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also about learning to handle her hypoglycemia in &quot;her&quot; real world. If I was still homesteading on the acerage her world would be different. I guess I see it as allowing her to learn how to handle it rather than just denying it or saying &quot;nope you can&#39;t have any of that in my home&quot;. I fear she would then just sneak snacks (which she constantly has the oportunity to do with kids coming buy offering her shares). Presently she tells them, no thanks I can&#39;t but I have fruit snacks in the bus.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaven presently in Colville Wa.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.716 / Virus Database: 472 - Release Date: 7/5/2004<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97154,"nextTopicId":97233}}
