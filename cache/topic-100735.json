We live just up from some certified rat burrows by a little pond and come fall they like to find warmer homes. It&#39;s been a problem for us and a few neighbours. Thankfully (for my sanity) this year we dug out, plastered, damp proofed, drained and insulated (outside) our basement so there&#39;s nowhere for them to get in. Or so we thought. My husband forgot to put in a doorjamb under the basement door so again, we had our visitors. But we trapped one and it may have been all there was. We&#39;re tearing down all the old gyproc and studs to clean out the basement and be rid of the rats once and for all. Hopefully the shrews, white footed mice, field mice and deer mice that we&#39;ve also found in the house at times will go as well. <br/>\n    It&#39;s been interesting. I&#39;ve been so paranoid at times that every unexplained noise was a rat but I&#39;ve also marveled at the ones we caught which were never as big as everyone assured me they would be (rats grow in size in peoples head I think) and always glossy and clean and cute. Snap traps work well with them. Glue traps led to one gruesome death involving my DH and a hammer so he&#39;s vowed never to use them again. I&#39;m to afraid of our cat or kids getting into poison to use it. A neighbour almost lost their dog that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n    And can you believe it...I&#39;ve heard so many good things about domestic rats that I&#39;d LOVE to have one. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn (in NS) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela S","from":"&quot;Angela S&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: rats, dogs, bunnies","postDate":"1098359480","msgId":100753,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDIxMTE1MTE2LkhBRUYyNDk3Lm10YTkuYWRlbHBoaWEubmV0QGxlaWdoPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEM4RDFBNEUyLTIzMkQtMTFEOS04NEZBLTAwMEE5NTdFRkU0NkBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":100752,"nextInTopic":100754,"prevInTime":100752,"nextInTime":100754,"topicId":100735,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve had a rabbit, a hamster, and guinea pigs.

The guinea pigs win, hands<br/>\ndown, imo.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe hamster just plain stunk and he peed in all the tubes of his habitrail<br/>\nso as cool as it looked, we couldn&#39;t use it.  Plus, he slept all day and ran<br/>\nall night on his wheel.  He was friendly to hold and cute but the clean up<br/>\nwas just nasty with this one.  I guess I couldn&#39;t tried different cage<br/>\noptions, but I didn&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe rabbit was ok.  We did handle her a lot at first but if she got scared,<br/>\nthose back legs would go and you&#39;d get scratched to pieces.  We kept her<br/>\nnails trimmed, but she didn&#39;t like that and I got scratched often just<br/>\ntrying to cut them.  I&#39;d wrap her in a towel and everything but she just<br/>\nseemed so nervous about it, which made me nervous. She ate wires in the<br/>\nhouse if you let her have freedom to roam.  We ended up letting her have run<br/>\nof the shed for a while and she loved that.  Clean up wasn&#39;t much of a<br/>\nproblem though.  When she was in her cage in the house we just put kitty<br/>\nlitter in the bottom and changed it every few days.  When she was in her<br/>\noutside cage, it was even easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe guinea pigs are the easiest by far and the friendliest.  We are down to<br/>\none now, but we had two.  We keep them in one of those really huge rubber<br/>\nmaid tubs.  It&#39;s probably 3-4 feet long and 2 feet wide. I tried many<br/>\ndifferent kind of beddings and found shredded paper to work the best. We<br/>\nkeep shredded paper in the bottom, a couple inches deep.  The one we have<br/>\nleft pees and poops in two different corners most of the time and I just<br/>\nreach in with a rubber glove every morning when I bring her treats and take<br/>\nout the soiled handful of paper and replace it with fresh paper.  She isn&#39;t<br/>\nvery smelly, not like the hamster was. (but I think males can be<br/>\nsmellier)(Rabbit pee was thick and nasty compared to guinea pig pee and the<br/>\nhamster urine just seemed so strong smelling to me.)  She is calm when I cut<br/>\nher nails and she loves to run around the family room in the basement.  She<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t usually soil on the floor when she is out, but if she does, it isn&#39;t<br/>\na big deal.  The carpet is short industrial carpet and we just soak it up<br/>\nwith paper towels.  She&#39;s only peed on it maybe twice.  It is really fun to<br/>\nwatch them run around when there are two of them because they follow each<br/>\nother like a train.  They love treats and will take them from your hand.<br/>\nThey are social animals and it is recommended that you get two so they have<br/>\ncompany.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, everyone has a different experience with different pets, but<br/>\nthat&#39;s ours.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela ~ Maine<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: rats, dogs, bunnies","postDate":"1098341553","msgId":100752,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM4RDFBNEUyLTIzMkQtMTFEOS04NEZBLTAwMEE5NTdFRkU0NkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNDYwMWM0YjZmMiQ2MmFjODFmMCQ2ZjYzMDgwNEB5b3VybzBrd2t3OWp3Yz4=","referencesHeader":"PGNsNm1qZStyYmpwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDA0NjAxYzRiNmYyJDYyYWM4MWYwJDZmNjMwODA0QHlvdXJvMGt3a3c5andjPg=="},"prevInTopic":100749,"nextInTopic":100753,"prevInTime":100751,"nextInTime":100753,"topicId":100735,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The voices of experience are not to be ignored.  I had a rabbit in my classroom for a few months when I was a teacher and he was pretty cool.  We let him out in the morning and he hopped around the classroom all day.  He was litter box trained when I got him from a parent.  I didn&#39;t have chairs in my room, only low tables and carpeting, the kids sat on the floor, and he would hop around them at their tables during the day.  Unfortunately, he chewed up the computer wires, so we had to start keeping him in the cage.  I do remember him being very skittish, but I thought it was because there were so many kids.  The rabbit went home with different kids each weekend.  We had a wonderful classroom hamster as well that the kids adored.  Very tame and loved to crawl around on the kids.  I had a few hamsters when I was younger they are great pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the rat, I just can&#39;t get past it.  We get river rats in our garage and they just creep me out.
