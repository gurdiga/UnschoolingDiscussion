Every person I asked at<br/>\nschool didn&#39;t know beyond the title. Even my parents did not know. I am<br/>\nusing my parents&#39; E-mail to ask you. --Liz Dear Liz:<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy to oblige, kiddo, but some people aren&#39;t going to be pleased. &quot;La<br/>\nCucaracha,&quot; one of Mexico&#39;s best-known folk songs, doesn&#39;t put the ideal<br/>\nspin on life south of the border. The U.S. may have amber waves of grain;<br/>\nthe UK has jolly jolly sixpence; Mexico has . . . cockroaches. The Mexican<br/>\nTourism Board can only hope monolingual Yankees don&#39;t realize what the title<br/>\nmeans. As possible evidence on this score I note that in Minneapolis, the<br/>\nKyoto of midwestern culture, La Cucaracha is the name of a restaurant.<br/>\nSomebody really ought to clue these people in. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut you wanted the lyrics. One complication is that there are about five<br/>\nmillion verses, many of them proof of how creative you can get on a couple<br/>\nquarts of Dos Equis at three o&#39;clock in the morning. Here are the two most<br/>\ncommonly quoted: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLa cucaracha, la cucaracha<br/>\nYa no puede caminar<br/>\nPorque no tiene, porque le falta<br/>\nMarijuana que fumar.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(The cockroach, the cockroach<br/>\nNow he can&#39;t go traveling<br/>\nBecause he doesn&#39;t have, because he lacks<br/>\nMarijuana to smoke.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can see how closer acquaintance with the lyrics does not improve the PR<br/>\nsituation. Sometimes the last line is replaced with a bowdlerization such as<br/>\nlimonada que tomar (lemonade to drink), but if you&#39;re old enough to be<br/>\nmessing with dad&#39;s E-mail program, you&#39;re old enough to know the truth. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo continue: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYa la murio la cucaracha<br/>\nYa la lleven a enterrar<br/>\nEntre cuatro zopilotes<br/>\nY un raton de sacristan.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(The cockroach just died<br/>\nAnd they carried him off to bury him<br/>\nAmong four buzzards<br/>\nAnd the sexton&#39;s mouse.) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re thinking: Mexicans are strange. But there&#39;s more going on here than<br/>\nmeets the eye. &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; is the Spanish equivalent of &quot;Yankee<br/>\nDoodle&quot;--a traditional satirical tune periodically fitted out with new<br/>\nlyrics to meet the needs of the moment. The origins of the song are obscure,<br/>\nbut apparently it&#39;s pretty old. Some verses I came across refer to the<br/>\nMoorish wars in Spain, which concluded with the conquest of the Moorish<br/>\nkingdom of Granada by Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492. (Obviously 1492 was a<br/>\nbig year for Ferdinand and Isabella on a number of fronts.) Probably the<br/>\nsong itself doesn&#39;t go back that far, but in an 1818 book, according to one<br/>\nsource, the Mexican writer Jose Joaquin Fernandez de Lizardi claimed the<br/>\nsong was brought to Mexico from Spain by a captain of marines. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne can find &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; lyrics commemorating 19th-century conflicts in<br/>\nboth Spain and Mexico, but verse production didn&#39;t really get rocking until<br/>\nthe Mexican revolution of 1910-1920. So many stanzas were added by partisans<br/>\non all sides during this period that today, despite its Spanish origin, the<br/>\nsong is associated mostly with Mexico. <br/>\n<br/>\nIncluded among the new lyrics were the verses quoted above. Some say the<br/>\njape about marijuana was directed at the dictatorial Mexican president<br/>\nVictoriano Huerta (ruled 1913-1914), ridiculed by his many enemies as a<br/>\ndrunk and dope fiend who lived only for his daily weed. No doubt the four<br/>\nbuzzards and the sexton&#39;s mouse were lampoons as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome claim la cucaracha refers solely to Pancho Villa, the<br/>\nbandido/revolutionary general who eluded U.S. troops following a 1916 attack<br/>\non an American border town, only to be assassinated in 1923. Others say the<br/>\nword refers solely to Villa&#39;s car or to the soldaderas, female soldiers/camp<br/>\nfollowers who provided cooking and other comforts to the various armies.<br/>\nThese claims are undoubtedly false--the identity of the cockroach varied<br/>\nwith the verse--but still, one shudders. If no one knows the verses to &quot;La<br/>\nCucaracha,&quot; it&#39;s probably just as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nCECIL ADAMS</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Digest Number 3812","postDate":"1057855452","msgId":76499,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNTkwMWMzNDcwMiQ3ZTI1ODI4MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDE1Yy4yMDlmNGM1Ni4yYzNlYmQxZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":76497,"nextInTopic":76502,"prevInTime":76498,"nextInTime":76500,"topicId":76490,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
