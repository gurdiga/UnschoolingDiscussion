(I know we are not<br/>\nsupposed to think in subjects - sorry!)  OK, I&#39;m trying to put my<br/>\nthoughts into type here:<br/>\nIn school, I learned that &quot;I wasn&#39;t good at art&quot;.   I have read Drawing<br/>\nwith Children and Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, but the bottom<br/>\nline is that I seldom sit down to draw or paint myself.  So now I have a<br/>\nchild who has gone through reams of paper, covering it with letters,<br/>\nscribbles, pictures, etc.  She clearly enjoys doing this.  Also, she is<br/>\nvery good and has really made some great pictures.  I have considered art<br/>\nlessons because I think she might enjoy seeing different techniques<br/>\ndemonstrated.  However, I think it would be hard to find someone willing<br/>\nto work with a 6 year old without believing that the 6 year old needs to<br/>\nbe taught.  In other words, I don&#39;t want her to attend &quot;art school&quot;,<br/>\nespecially considering that she hasn&#39;t asked for it!  The lessons that I<br/>\nhave noticed locally all seem rather schoolish.<br/>\nWe do read books about art and artists and go to museums.  I do supply<br/>\nlots of paper.  We have pastel chalk, colored pencils, felt markers, and<br/>\nsome paint.  Should I just leave it at that?  Will she really let me know<br/>\nif she wants more?  How will she know what is out there to ask for?  Do<br/>\nkids always make it clear what they are asking for?  Am I just projecting<br/>\nmy desire to be better at drawing onto my child?  She really shows an<br/>\ninterest in drawing that my other child doesn&#39;t.<br/>\nGuess I am just looking for reassurance here.  Unschooling makes sense to<br/>\nme, but I still need some ideas on the details!  My local support for<br/>\nunschooling is dwindling, as their kids get older and they begin to<br/>\ndecide to unschool &quot;everything but math&quot;, or that their kids are really<br/>\n&quot;better behaved when the parent insists on a certain amount of schoolwork<br/>\neach day&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nSuccess is a process of living.<br/>\nIt&#39;s stopping for the moments of beauty, of pleasure, the moments of<br/>\npeace.<br/>\nSuccess is not a destination that you ever reach.<br/>\nSuccess is the quality of the journey.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23680,"nextTopicId":23592}}
