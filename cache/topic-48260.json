It&#39;s more <br/>\nof a mixed bag of genres from world music to R&B to reggae to contemporary <br/>\nacoustic.  GaiaWolf&#39;s mission has to do with promoting universal harmony <br/>\namongst species, so to that end we sing about wolves in Yellowstone, how <br/>\ndrought in the Serengeti affects the elephants who live there, peace, the <br/>\nmanatee, pilot whales, starting over, what the Statue of Liberty might say <br/>\nif she could talk and tell us what she&#39;s been seeing, and on and on.  If <br/>\nyou&#39;d like to hear some of the music we do, you can listen for free at this <br/>\nwebsite:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/192/ec_lorick__gaiawolf.html\">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/192/ec_lorick__gaiawolf.html</a>  My <br/>\nmost favorite tune on there is Abby, Stay.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s your instrument, Tia?
