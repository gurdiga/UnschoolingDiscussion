But they&#39;ve <br/>\nplayed the game so often they know the rules.  It&#39;s amazing, actually, how <br/>\noften Risk is cited by them as the source of some geography fact they know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFamily tradition of course.   I was - and still am - hopeless at geography.  <br/>\nBut it&#39;s amazing how losing a Trivial Pursuit game to someone who actually <br/>\nknows the stations at each end of the Trans-Siberian Railway indelibly <br/>\nimprints the information on your mind!<br/>\n<br/>\n                       Mattie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3450,"nextTopicId":3447}}
