As a new unschooler I have no idea whether or<br/>\nnot this fits under the cover of &#39;unschooling&#39; (!!!) but this is what works<br/>\nfor us. My kids have the whole day to do their thing. But there are 2 times<br/>\ndesignated as &#39;tidy-up time&#39; - 8h00 and 17h30. (Oh, and the older kids clear<br/>\nup after meals.)<br/>\nThis because I become tense and stressed if my home is always upside down.<br/>\nSo at those times, whoever is home pitches in and tidies up whatever is out<br/>\nof place. At all other times<br/>\n(unless mother-in-law is coming for tea!!!) I ignore the mess and let them<br/>\nlive.<br/>\nThe children didn&#39;t have much say in deciding this; it was instituted when<br/>\nthe first was a baby. It has become one of our family habits, and generally<br/>\nit works without problems.<br/>\nThere is a lot of focus on the list about respecting and trusting children -<br/>\nthis has been wonderful.However, I also feel that my children need to<br/>\nconsider me. So whether or not it is what they would chose, there are some<br/>\nthings that really infringe on my enjoyment of our home, and I therefore<br/>\nexpect them to be sensitive to this in the same way as what I try to be<br/>\nsensitive to their needs.<br/>\nComments from any &#39;experienced&#39;  unschoolers?<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nCathy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85994576,"authorName":"Kolleen","from":"Kolleen &lt;Kolleen@...&gt;","profile":"kaydeecross","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Balance- chores","postDate":"1012232800","msgId":31731,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMTI4MTU0Ni5nMFNGa0JmWjAxMjI0MUBueWNzbXRwMW91dC5yZGMtbnljLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":31694,"nextInTopic":31967,"prevInTime":31730,"nextInTime":31732,"topicId":31694,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He subsequently <br/>\nturned it into an area that was impossible to walk through. He soon <br/>\nrealized that he couldn&#39;t find most pieces to his toys and suffered for <br/>\nmonths.<br/>\n <br/>\nEventually he asked me to help him and I did. We cleaned it up and <br/>\norganized the mess. It took 3 days and lots of plastic bins. As we did <br/>\nthis, I discussed with him how he could choose to put away things before <br/>\nhe moved onto the next.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow thats what he does and he&#39;s quite happy to find all his stuff. The <br/>\nfact that the plastic bins, drawer and other storage helpers are around <br/>\nmakes it a breeze to put back together.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he makes a mess that a bit overwhelming, he might ask me to help and I <br/>\ndo. Because we ask eachother for help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might be up in the bedroom and ask him to bring me something. He does <br/>\nmost of the time. But he knows he isn&#39;t obligated and will tell me, I <br/>\ncan&#39;t or I&#39;m busy if he is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts something that has evolved out of letting him see how things work one <br/>\nway and how things work another way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe helps me cook some things. But only certain things that he likes. And <br/>\nas far as cleaning, we pick up our plates from the table, or floor where <br/>\nwe ate and put them in the sink. I might ask him to put the trash bag in <br/>\nthe can and he is glad to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as bedtime. He chooses his own. And its usually very late. Between <br/>\n11-1. Because we have a family bed, sometimes he waits up for me and <br/>\nsometimes he goes to bed just because I am. There&#39;s no set rules about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe needs to be at basketball by 9am on Saturday. So after a many weeks of <br/>\nfeeling icky in the morning, he finally said to me &#39;I&#39;m going to go to <br/>\nbed at 10 on the night before basketball&#39;. This was self-declared and it <br/>\njust happened this past weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, it will take a few more months to realize that he can&#39;t choose 10 on <br/>\none night and 1 on the other nights because he&#39;ll never get to sleep on <br/>\nthe 10 night. So in the next few weeks, I will discuss this with him when <br/>\nthe issue comes up. I don&#39;t have an agenda about it. It will just happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nTV is something that I don&#39;t mind him watching. But most of the time its <br/>\nMY fault that he might watch it too much. Either I&#39;m not offering <br/>\nenvironmental stimulation or I&#39;m to under the weather to.  When he has <br/>\noptions, he chooses the best one for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis father can&#39;t understand why he would rather watch TV than go to work <br/>\nwith him. But he hasn&#39;t quite caught up with the whole unschooling thing. <br/>\nHe thinks that the kid just wants to watch TV. He hasn&#39;t put together the <br/>\noptions he&#39;s offering.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I walk over and say &#39;lets go to the zoo and carasel (sp)&#39;, the kid is <br/>\ndressed and bugging me to leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that gives you a good idea what I mean by self-imposed. And at <br/>\nthis point I am unschooling my son and my unhusband. The latter being a <br/>\nbit harder since his brain is way hardwired in one direction :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nkolleen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":60283004,"authorName":"Heather Woodward","from":"&quot;Heather Woodward&quot; &lt;bacwoodz@...&gt;","profile":"bacwoodz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Balance- chores","postDate":"1012179921","msgId":31694,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGYwMWMxYTc5NyRkZDNmNTRhMCQxM2ZlMzIzZkBUSElOS1BBRDc2MFhMPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDIwMTI4MDAyMS5nMFMwTGpFRTAyMjEyM0BueWNzbXRwMm91dC5yZGMtbnljLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31731,"prevInTime":31693,"nextInTime":31695,"topicId":31694,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If you don t mind sharing this with me ... someone made this statement.. btw: In our household, there are no chores, no TV limits, no limits besides self","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1699338522\">If you don&#39;t mind sharing this with me ... someone made this statement..<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw: In our household, there are no chores, no TV limits, no limits <br/>\nbesides self imposed ones. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this mean that you do all the chores or that the kids participate willingly?  My kids are young - but I would like them to grow up and participate as family members... the unschooling mindset would seem to suggest you wouldn&#39;t use a &quot;chore list/chart&quot; or have consequences for things not done - <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a question about this - as I have an issue with this in my life- in my household there is this problem... my husband likes everything really neat (insanely neat) - he pitches in and definitely does more than his &quot;fair&quot; share - but as far as the kids go there is this stress. I don&#39;t tend to have them pick up everything.... books are everywhere. If we are working on a project, I have no problem leaving it out.. etc.  I have little ones, and they seem to make incredible messes - and I could go  crazy running around and picking up after them.... but when dad comes home - instead of dinner and fun and games it is a major clean-up which just ends in tears for all involved...  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what are the suggestions here - as far as having kids do chores, or being responsible for their &quot;room&quot;. I have heard from many people that in order for kids to learn to do these things and take control of their belongings, etc they need to be made to do chores - however small they may be... I just have not been organized enough to do this - it seems quicker for me to just do it - which doesn&#39;t seem to help the overall situation....<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions......<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Kolleen <br/>\n  To: Unschooling.com <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, January 27, 2002 7:22 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Balance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;Tia wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;I think the people on this list handle the idea of chores in a lot of <br/>\n  &gt;different ways.
