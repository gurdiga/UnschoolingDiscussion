We have a similar situation, my 12yro son Tom is musical guy, he took violin ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1741521358\">In a message dated 1/9/2004 3:02:22 PM Central Standard Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MarSi77@...\">MarSi77@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I told him I would still get him the new guitar ( the next step up) and <br/>\n&gt; that he can play when he WANTS to. I also told him his teacher said anytime <br/>\n&gt; he <br/>\n&gt; wants to learn a few more songs he would fit him in. <br/>\n&gt; His teacher&#39;s advice was above all &quot;to love music&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We have a similar situation, my 12yro son Tom is musical guy, he took violin <br/>\nlessons a few years ago for about 6 mos but got interested in piano so the <br/>\nsame teacher would play around with him during the lesson with both the piano and <br/>\nthe violin. Eventually he decided that he didn&#39;t want anymore lessons at that <br/>\ntime but liked the teacher (and she liked him) and felt bad at leaving her.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year he thought he might like more piano lessons so we caled a lady in <br/>\nour neighborhood but she had a waiting list which we put his name on and found <br/>\nanother teacher. Whoa, the application alone felt like a college application <br/>\nand she made learning the piano look like a lot of work to me, Tom went 2 weeks <br/>\nand asked if he could stop so I let him. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe lady in the neighborhood called so he tried a few lessons with her and <br/>\nstill opted to go it alone. He has added the electric guitar to his collection <br/>\nand is quite content having dad show him a few cords and figuring the rest out <br/>\non his own. He will play the piano a while then leave it alone. A friend came <br/>\nover with her kids one day and one of her boys showed him the rest of a song <br/>\nhe had been picking out. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve offered lessons on either instrument if he wants them. It&#39;s just <br/>\ninteresting to watch the progression. I am glad he is adament that he doesn&#39;t want <br/>\nlessons if he doesn&#39;t. So many people think that just because you like something <br/>\nor are good at it you should run and take a lesson and I admit that was my <br/>\nfirst thought but my son has taught me otherwise. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also taught me how to give time for an answer, when he was learning to <br/>\nread he would read out loud to me, if he got stuck on a word I would right away <br/>\ntell it to him. He would get so angry and tell me to let him figure it out and <br/>\nif he wanted help he would ask. We still do it that way and I have even had to <br/>\ntell my mom to wait which she hated, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids are good teachers, <br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88166,"nextTopicId":88172}}
