I have not told the court yet. have you<br/>\n<br/>\nconsidered talking to your court worker (for your son&#39;s case - In Michigan<br/>\n<br/>\nit is Friend of the Court) about wanting to move, and what it would take to<br/>\n<br/>\nbe able to move?

It is worth checking.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think I read an article in Newsweek yesterday that said that 4 states <br/>\nhad relaxed their laws in recent years, giving custodial parents back more <br/>\nfreedom to move.
