They insisted that our son should be able to drive on the <br/>\nroad after six hours of instruction to some arbitrary standard (with <br/>\nno other &quot;official&quot; road hours under his belt) -before- issuing a <br/>\nlearner&#39;s permit (you know, the one you get so you can learn how to <br/>\ndrive on the road?) and when he &quot;failed&quot; to meet their so-called <br/>\nstandard, they had the legal right (as a for-profit company offering <br/>\na state-mandated service) to require us to fork over ex-tra bucks <br/>\nfor ex-tra hours from their ex-pert driving instructor.  What a scam!<br/>\n<br/>\nNext time around -- No driver&#39;s ed course required in SC -- <br/>\nautodidacts simply pass the written test, which includes some of the <br/>\ndrug & alcohol awareness info, and receive a learner&#39;s permit -- <br/>\nthen, proceed to learn to drive on the road under an adult, licensed <br/>\ndriver&#39;s supervision (you know, like the old days when your parents <br/>\nsat by your side and took part in the process as a matter of course -<br/>\n- white knuckles notwithstanding.)  Common sense and a lot of love <br/>\nkept them in the passenger&#39;s seat till they were confident in our <br/>\nability to steer clear of trouble.  Those were the days, my friend...<br/>\n<br/>\nHere we are in FL -- mandated Traffic Law & Substance Abuse course, <br/>\nreasonable priced (under $50) and even available in a convenient <br/>\nonline version.  Major problem -- the course content on substance <br/>\nabuse is highly objectionable (nightmarish to those who have gone <br/>\nthrough the trauma of losing loved ones to DUI) and in conflict with <br/>\nour sincerely-held religious beliefs and educational philosophy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHave contacted the HSMV and State Representatives for information on <br/>\na waiver (for the objectionable part of the course, if not all), but <br/>\nno go.  Our Senator&#39;s legislative assistant is still looking into <br/>\nthe matter... maybe.  Once we exhausted the obvious legal <br/>\nalternatives, we decided to check out CompuHigh&#39;s offerings and drop <br/>\na line to Pat Montgomery at Clonlara.  Haven&#39;t received a response <br/>\nin the past few weeks since our first inquiry, so plan to follow-up <br/>\nin a week or so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWill have to see if any of the umbrella schools/co-ops here in FL <br/>\nhave tackled this one already -- perhaps it&#39;s our turn to take the <br/>\nwheel and formalize our relationship to the un/homeschooling <br/>\ncommunity by gearing driver&#39;s ed to individual needs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO, driving should never be tied into grades, attendance, or <br/>\nanything else as a matter of privilege -- it should be recognized as <br/>\na marketable skill, and in some cases, an absolute necessity.  We <br/>\nwant all who are able to take the initiative to gain this skill <br/>\nwithout compromising their values or welfare in the process.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAdvice & suggestions welcome & encouraged!
