The first place I heard of <br/>\nJohn Holt was in a required sociology of education class. I still have <br/>\nthe book and having recently dug it out (after nearly 20 yrs) I was <br/>\nquite surprised to see how much I had underlined and taken notes. Guess <br/>\nI was an unschooler at heart, even then. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nsusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thursday, December 12, 2002, at 11:01  AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robin9700@...\">robin9700@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 12/11/2002 10:10:44 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In a message dated 12/11/02 4:38:36 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robin9700@...\">robin9700@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;A lot of us were &quot;trained as teachers&quot; (and I&#39;m using those quotes <br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; represent the shudder I feel at the &quot;teacher training&quot; in those days, <br/>\n&gt; but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was an English major and only went to the college of education when I <br/>\n&gt; had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to).    You&#39;ll need another excuse. &lt;g&gt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yeah.... my teacher ed was an &quot;add on&quot; as well, although I did &quot;buy <br/>\n&gt; into&quot; it.<br/>\n&gt; No excuses.  I am not questioning the validity....well<br/>\n&gt; nonvalidity..whatever... of teaching practices or the whole idea of <br/>\n&gt; teaching<br/>\n&gt; itself.   I am beyond that.
