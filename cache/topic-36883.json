My son had some bad influences in public school.  <br/>\nBoys in his class, especially the ones with older sibilings, were not <br/>\nvery kind to him; lots of teasing and making fun of.  So I understand <br/>\nwhere his hostility is coming from.  It&#39;s so hard for me to let go of <br/>\nthe only education I know, which is public school.
