Here&#39;s what I do know though. <br/>\nSome of my details may be way off.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere *was* a standoff and shootout at a Utah home in the 1970&#39;s. It  <br/>\nhappened in a town called Kamas, which is very close to my home. I do not <br/>\nremember for sure if the Dad was killed or not. The children *were* being <br/>\nhomeschooled, but that alone was not the issue. It was a polygamist family <br/>\nand there were charges of child abuse. The kids were not in school, but they <br/>\nwere sent off to work in the family construction business at age 10, or <br/>\nmarried off (if a female) at about 13 or 14. The family thought the state <br/>\nshould have no right to say how they raised their children and armed <br/>\nthemselves to fight home visits. The issues were much more about the <br/>\nproblems with polygamist lifestyles, than homeschooling itself.  I&#39;ve been <br/>\ntold though, that Utah now has it&#39;s liberal homeschooling policy because of <br/>\nthis incident.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I doubt that police went up to a man and shot him because his children <br/>\n&gt;&gt;were out of school.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do believe it was much more involved than this.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:  2283 - who &quot;Owns&quot; our children?","postDate":"1030324300","msgId":41974,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDgyNTE4MDA1OS4wMWM2ZWE1MEBwb3AuaXNsYW5kbmV0LmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEI5OEU4QkEwLjE1NzUlbmVkdmFyZUBudHBseC5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDEwMzAyMzkwODkuMTIyMC4zNDYwMi5tNkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":41958,"nextInTopic":42108,"prevInTime":41973,"nextInTime":41975,"topicId":41949,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
