I still have my original copy.  Pages are torn, a few missing <br/>\n&gt; and I only have the front cover, which is barely attached by the thread <br/>\n&gt; binding.  I purchased a new copy for my children but alas, they don&#39;t find <br/>\n&gt; comfort in that book as I once did.  I suppose that&#39;s a good thing! &lt;bg&gt;  I <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; still read it though.  Despite my reasons for loving it then, I still find <br/>\n&gt; such joy in that book.  I&#39;m still a day-dreamer, dreaming of what I will do <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; to my house and yard, and find a lot of inspiration in that little gem of a <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; book. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OH and it has a happy ending!!!<br/>\n&gt; Jennifer<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, I loved that book so much!!!
