It&#39;s all my eldest can do to keep up with his own needs. If I didn&#39;t do his laundry once in a while he&#39;d just wear dirty clothes. This said I couldn&#39;t imagine our family without him! His contributions far outweigh the extra work he creates and we all adore him. He does order the little ones to get him this and that, now and then, but they can&#39;t seem to do enough for him or get enough of him, most of the time. If I really need his help he&#39;s always there for me, but our ideas of what needs to be done and when, are as different as an 18 year old man and a 45 year old woman &lt;bg&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy middle son is vacuuming as I post. He knows that tomorrow I&#39;ll be making dinner for all of his grandparents and if he wants me  to find an hour to take him to the skateboard park he&#39;d better get a jump on what I like to see done before they all arrive. I didn&#39;t ask him to do a thing. My little girl is more like big brother but she&#39;s encouraged to pitch in when she sees me show my gratitude to middle brother. <br/>\n<br/>\nBiggest brother and little sister love to cook. Daisy will probably make something for desert tomorrow, she can follow a simple recipe and has mastered butterscotch brownies, rice pudding, fruit salad, coffee cake and a variety of cookies and she&#39;s only 7. I&#39;ve always joked, with people who question our lifestyle, that culinary arts is a big part of our curriculum.  I wouldn&#39;t expect the kids to help with things like cooking dinner or setting the table because I know they would be happy with a peanut butter sandwich and a glass of OJ in front of the TV. <br/>\n<br/>\nTaking this time to write about our family reminds me of how happy we are and how lucky I am! I&#39;m grateful to have a kitchen to clean, a washing machine to do the laundry, a bed to make, a bathroom to scrub etc etc etc..... Family life has been the highlight of my adventures to date and having an 18 year old reminds me to savor the chaos while I can&lt;BG&gt; I think I&#39;ve been close to Lovemary&#39;s definition for inner peace except for # 7.

The following <br/>\nis my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that the less I ask my boys to do something, the more they <br/>\nwant to do it.  They see me make three meals every day.  I never ask <br/>\nthem to help me.  I enjoy watching them do their own thing, even if it&#39;s <br/>\njust relaxing and watching TV or playing their play station.  If they&#39;re <br/>\nhappy, I&#39;m happy.  I have found that as they get older they begin to <br/>\nvolunteer more and more often to help me with this or that.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhappen every day, but it certainly DOES happen.  They will ask to set <br/>\nthe table, grate the cheese, mop the floor, dust, vacuum, clean the <br/>\nwindows, etc.  I wish I could share with you the feeling I get when they <br/>\nask to do these things.  I know then, without a doubt, that unschooling <br/>\nis working.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way to turn someone off to something is to make them do it.  <br/>\nModeling is the best teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always considered unschooling a way of life, not just a way of <br/>\neducating.  I believe in my boys having as many choices in their lives <br/>\nas possible.  I am not about to interrupt their fun so they can help me <br/>\nwith dinner.  That is the best way to teach them that these chores are <br/>\nunpleasant and no one should want to do them voluntarily.  I do them <br/>\nvoluntarily because I love my family and they are necessary.  Of course, <br/>\nthere are times when I resent the fact that my husband is playing his <br/>\ncomputer games for hours at a time while I have to do my housework (not <br/>\nvery well - my house is a mess!) or cook the meals, etc.  When I find I <br/>\nneed a little help, I&#39;ll ask him, not my boys.  I try and ask as little <br/>\nas possible from my boys, and I find, the less I ask, the more they <br/>\nvolunteer.

I <br/>\nbelieve that I am saved solely through faith in Jesus as my Savior <br/>\nand Lord.  I don&#39;t believe that works do anything to save me although <br/>\nI want to live for Jesus out of love for Him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to think of what you might be thinking of when you say a <br/>\ncontrolled lifestyle.  Maybe going to lots of church services?  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t believe in institutional church services.  I do believe that <br/>\nChristians are supposed to *be* the church and daily encourage and <br/>\nexhort one another.  I believe that today&#39;s institutional churches <br/>\nwere created by man, not by God.  We don&#39;t go to church although we <br/>\nfellowship with other Christians as often as the Lord brings them <br/>\ninto our paths.  We did recently start going to Sunday School because <br/>\nthere is one near by that the kids like to go to and they ask me to <br/>\ntake them.  They are aware that they can stop going whenever they <br/>\nwant.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat else--maybe submission to a husband?  Yep, I do believe that <br/>\nJesus wants us to submit to our husbands as a picture of how Christ <br/>\nsubmitted to the Father.  Equal, yet different roles.  I also believe <br/>\nthat it is my job to be a helper to dh.  Sometimes I don&#39;t do a great <br/>\njob on the submissive or the helper parts, but I pray for God&#39;s grace <br/>\nto help me in those areas.  Dh is a great guy who loves me very much <br/>\nand I have never felt opressed in any way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect I am controlling of what my kids watch and read than most <br/>\nunschoolers on this list.  I don&#39;t control tv or books for <br/>\neducational reasons but I do make sure I read anything with <br/>\nobjectionable content with my kids instead of letting them read it on <br/>\ntheir own (note that my oldest is only 8 so this might change when <br/>\nshe&#39;s a teenager and I feel she is able to discern what is true on <br/>\nher own).  For example, if we&#39;re reading a book and there&#39;s a <br/>\nreference to the earth being millions of years old, I pause and <br/>\nremind the kids that God created the earth only 6000 years ago.  The <br/>\nkids know there&#39;s certain tv shows they are forbidden to watch and <br/>\nthey&#39;re very good about it.  Dd is even starting to notice things on <br/>\nher own that would contradict our faith and she is quick to turn it <br/>\noff, especially if one of her younger brothers are around.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; flexibility and complete freedom, at least as far as learning is<br/>\n&gt; concerned. How do you reconcile the two?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Until recently, I was an extremely relaxed homeschooler, but I&#39;ve <br/>\nrecently made the plunge to total unschooling.  I clearly see in <br/>\nScripture that I&#39;m supposed to teach my children how to develop a <br/>\nrelationship with Jesus and how to live for Him.  I don&#39;t see <br/>\nanything in Scripture that tells me I need to teach my children to <br/>\nread by a certain age or make them sit down and be lectured, drilled, <br/>\nor made to fill out worksheets day after day.  As a matter of fact, I <br/>\nam concerned that our culture has made an idol of education.  I <br/>\nbelieve God wants us to use the brains He gave us for His honor and <br/>\nglory, but not to put academic success on a high pedastal and give it <br/>\nthe high place of honor our culture does.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that answer some of your questions?  Any more? <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"sheran@ptd.net","from":"sheran@...","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Something that&#39;s been bothering me about this list...","postDate":"1007443917","msgId":29320,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDl1aG40ZCtrZzBuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMzcwMWMxN2MxMSQxM2U3YTE0MCQwMjAxYThjMEB6b29vZy5vcmc+"},"prevInTopic":29302,"nextInTopic":29321,"prevInTime":29319,"nextInTime":29321,"topicId":29223,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The<br/>\nconnotations are those brought about by individual prejudices and life<br/>\nexperiences.  They are not universal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is your choice to not ask and thus not understand what the other party is<br/>\ntrying to say.  However, you do not know whether or not the child knows and<br/>\nuses the parents&#39; defintion, if the child knows how others define the word<br/>\nnor if they have even heard the phrase/words used.  This is all supposition<br/>\nwhich lends nothing to understanding, only to continuing arguments.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I imagine it hurts a lot to have your parent say you are lazy and<br/>\n&gt; willful, whether the parents know or accept that it hurts or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***Again, that is your imaginings, not necessarily anything based in fact.<br/>\nIf you told my 9 yo that she was willful, she&#39;d grin and say &quot;I&#39;m a Taurus<br/>\nand proud of it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich brings us full circle, IF one is interested in understanding and<br/>\nlearning, one asks for definitions of words and meanings of phrases.
