If that is the case, it isn&#39;t <br/>\neven necessary for me to state my opinions on the matter other than to say, <br/>\nyour son is an adult and HE is making the decision to take Ritalin at this <br/>\npoint.  Obviously, you are very content with the decisions you and your son <br/>\nhave made and I think that&#39;s what matters for *you*.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Please don&#39;t take this as though I am trying to be rude, as I am not.  I <br/>\njust don&#39;t know how else to say it so that it will make sense.)  What we <br/>\nthink really doesn&#39;t matter in the end.  We can offer our thoughts and <br/>\nexperiences for you to take or leave at will.  If you feel like something is <br/>\nrubbing you the wrong way, either you feel a hint of guilt for your decision <br/>\nor you feel sound in your decision and want to help us understand.  There <br/>\nwill always be those that won&#39;t understand, no matter how many times you try <br/>\nto explain it to them.  (Think unschooling!)  I can see that you feel very <br/>\npassionate about the improvements you have seen in your son as a result of <br/>\nRitalin.  To that, I say GREAT!  Seriously!  The possible future <br/>\nramifications are something only you and your son will have to face.  Not me <br/>\nand not anyone else on this list.  Kuddos to you for doing what you feel is <br/>\nbest for your family!  That&#39;s not to say every comment should be discounted, <br/>\njust that you have done what any of us would do and that is to make the best <br/>\ninformed decision with the information you have at hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace and Light,<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
