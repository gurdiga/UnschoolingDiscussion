Well, unless I am in the situation, I would assume that the child did do something wrong that caused the parent to want to spank him or her. I wouldn&#39;t think the parent just likes to give out spankings for the fun of it. As for spanking being violence, I don&#39;t know. I havent&#39; thought of it that way before, honestly. I just *know* that it&#39;s wrong for me and my kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t agree. I came from a spanking, hitting,<br/>\n  getting out the wooden spoons environment and I also came from a<br/>\n  let&#39;s call those guys *N* and those other guys *S* and they are not<br/>\n  white like us environment. I had to reach beyond my comfort zone and<br/>\n  grow to come to understand how both are dehumanizing, not just to<br/>\n  those that get hit and called names, but also to the person doing<br/>\n  the hitting and the name calling. It is simply wrong. Not a<br/>\n  &quot;choice&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Everything is a choice.

Opinions stated as facts and no discussion allowed do bother me. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe this is a southern thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** People don&#39;t spank as much in the north or west? I haven&#39;t been out of the south since I&#39;ve become a parent, so I wasn&#39;t really noticing how people treated their children then. <br/>\n<br/>\n   Maybe the<br/>\n  people you meet on a day to day basis are so desensitized to other&#39;s<br/>\n  pain that it doesn&#39;t even touch their feeling meter.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Quite possible. <br/>\n<br/>\n   Maybe it<br/>\n  doesn&#39;t touch yours. <br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Unless it&#39;s done in anger or other high emotional state, I guess spanking really doesn&#39;t bother me. I don&#39;t like it, I don&#39;t do it, but no, it doesn&#39;t really bother me. <br/>\n<br/>\n  We are society.  We are the change that makes better lives possible<br/>\n  for all of us -- children too. Today&#39;s beaten and bullied and<br/>\n  violated child is tomorrow&#39;s abuser.

Well, unless I am in the situation, I would assume that the child did do something wrong that caused the parent to want to spank him or her. I wouldn&#39;t think the parent just likes to give out spankings for the fun of it. As for spanking being violence, I don&#39;t know. I havent&#39; thought of it that way before, honestly. I just *know* that it&#39;s wrong for me and my kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t agree. I came from a spanking, hitting,<br/>\n  getting out the wooden spoons environment and I also came from a<br/>\n  let&#39;s call those guys *N* and those other guys *S* and they are not<br/>\n  white like us environment.

I don&#39;t like it, I don&#39;t do it, but no, it doesn&#39;t really bother me. <br/>\n<br/>\n  We are society.

It&#39;s about respecting others choices. <br/>\n<br/>\n  If Holly my daughter who is ten were being abused here and the neighbors <br/>\n  suspected it, or saw it, and thought &quot;Well, if she didn&#39;t ask for advice, I <br/>\n  have no right to interfere,&quot; they would be accomplices.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Of course. That&#39;s abuse. Something should be done about it. Most times when people step in and give their two cents worth to parents, it&#39;s not for abuse, it&#39;s for parenting issues.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  What are you saying? <br/>\n  We all wear blinders and let horrors go unnoted and unaddressed?<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** No. Call someone to report abuse or &quot;horrors&quot; and leave the every-day family interactions alone. <br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;No one is right all the time&quot; is the same argument this horrible former <br/>\n  knight used.  He said &quot;You can&#39;t accuse me of anything because you&#39;re not pe<br/>\n  rfect.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I thought that was his personal idiocy and now I read it HERE!??<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** That doesn&#39;t have anything to do with parents dealing with their children on a daily basis. If you break the law, you answer to the law. The people who uphold the law don&#39;t have to be perfect. What I&#39;m saying is that parents don&#39;t all share the same child-rearing philosophies and it&#39;s not realistic to expect to change people&#39;s entire way of doing things by making them feel attacked and turning their children against them, which is what happens a lot when someone steps in and gives unsolicited advice. <br/>\n<br/>\n  My children DO want to hear what they are wrong and they DO listen if I tell <br/>\n  them.<br/>\n  Are you saying you don&#39;t tell your children when they&#39;re wrong?<br/>\n  Are you saying your children don&#39;t listen?<br/>\n  ** No, I don&#39;t. I ask them questions about how they&#39;d feel, what might be a better way, how it makes me feel, etc. and let them come to their own conclusions. They do this remarkably well, and if they come to a different conclusion than I would have made, that doesn&#39;t make them wrong. If I can trust my children to make the right choices for themselves, surely I can trust adults to do the same. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ARE YOU SAYING you would never act or speak in defense of someone being <br/>\n  wronged by someone bigger or worse?<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** That&#39;s a broad statement. If they are a normal, healthy adult, they can speak up for themselves, reach out for help if they want it and are willing to accept it. Encourage them to do so if they&#39;re open to encouragement. If they are a child..... well, as I&#39;ve said, I&#39;d report abuse. A child picking on another, I&#39;d re-direct them, maybe send them to their parents. A parent discliplining her child.... their business, as long as it&#39;s not abuse. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you think it was wrong of people to bring the priest abuses to light? <br/>\n<br/>\n  ** I think everyone should be made aware of sexual abusers no matter what they make a living doing. <br/>\n<br/>\n   My <br/>\n  friend Jerome was molested by a priest for over a year, when he was  7 and 8 <br/>\n  years old.   If he didn&#39;t feel like reporting it, but that priest went on to <br/>\n  do it to others, you&#39;re saying that&#39;s fine?? That if Jerome didn&#39;t consider <br/>\n  it to be bad that it was nobody else&#39;s business?&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** No, I&#39;m saying that&#39;s life. That&#39;s why people SHOULD tell about and report it, so it doesn&#39;t happen again. That&#39;s abuse, and should always be reported. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sick and wrong again.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Maybe it&#39;s wrong in your world, but not mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That&#39;s why people are afraid to report rape and abuse, because they&#39;re afraid <br/>\n  other adults will look away.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** And they do. That&#39;s a reality. Doesn&#39;t change the fact that it IS abuse and should be reported. I&#39;ve been on both sides..... I&#39;ve been abused, almost raped.... and I&#39;ve had a good friend who messed up bad and raped someone. <br/>\n<br/>\n  By this reasoning, if the girl is spanked harder later it&#39;s my fault.  That&#39;s <br/>\n  stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** No, not your fault. There&#39;s another word I&#39;m looking for and can&#39;t think of. Hmmm. I&#39;ve lost it. You should just be aware that this is a real possiblity and act accordingly. If the family are NOT abusers, it will only maybe convince them to only spank in their home. If they ARE abusers, it can put the child in real danger. And you have no way of telling if they are abusers or not. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  So if a man is hitting a woman in a restaurant (Village Inn on Central in <br/>\n  Albuquerque) that other diners should not move to take him off her?  (Me and <br/>\n  Cathyn, two years ago, kept her from being kicked any more, after she had <br/>\n  been hit, dragged out of a booth, and kicked.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  You would have just ignored it and let it go?  <br/>\n<br/>\n  ** I&#39;ve been on both sides of this issue, too. Actually, you can be doing more harm than good here too. IF the lady reached out or called out or indicated she wanted help, then by all means, help her. But if not, the best thing to do would be to call the cops. If she&#39;s planning on staying with the guy, (even tho that&#39;s a lousy and stupid choice) he could very well turn on her later at home and accuse her of calling friends to interfere with their lives. Hard call, since you can&#39;t know. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Are you calling your child lazybones more now because people here asked you <br/>\n  not to?<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** No, but neither do I have the need to reaffirm my beliefs just because someone else doesn&#39;t agree with them. Many people do. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Doctors and teachers have obligations to report abuse when they see it.  So <br/>\n  do some other professions.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If your husband is beating you and you are afraid to report it, by your own <br/>\n  rules you wouldn&#39;t want anyone else to report it either because they might be <br/>\n  killed or you might be hit harder later?<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Been there (kinda). And yes, I was glad no one reported it. Still don&#39;t regret that choice. If I&#39;d felt it was in my best interests to report it, I would have done so or asked someone else to do so. Reporting it would have created a whole, even bigger, set of problems, though. I&#39;m glad my friends respected my choice and me enough to find out my wishes before running off half-cocked and doing something about it. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Please clarify, because  what you have written here is frightening.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Life is frightening - also wonderful, joyful, disappointing, and a lot of other things too. But it seems like you&#39;re trying to purposely mis-understand me. Abuse of a child should always be reported. I think that is fact, and no one will disagree. I believe, and some may disagree, than an adult should make the choice of whether or not to report abuse of theirself based on several factors, including what they personally want, whether it&#39;s possible to happen to someone else, and what they likely results will be. There is a great difference in abuse and in a parent discliplining their child with a spanking, though.<br/>\n  Myranda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

It makes us feel<br/>\nuncomfortable because we are no longer sure we are right. We might<br/>\nspend quite a bit of time and energy thinking mean things about<br/>\nanother person to justify ourselves but it wasn&#39;t really the OTHER<br/>\nperson who makes us feel uncomfortable. It is the niggling suspicion<br/>\nthat entered not only our children&#39;s heads but our own that we might<br/>\npossibly handled the situation a bit differently and possibly<br/>\nbetter. When we are really sure of something it doesn&#39;t bother us a<br/>\nbit to have a differing opinion on it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;    I used to think a lot of things twenty years ago that I<br/>\n&gt;   don&#39;t think now. I&#39;ve grown and changed. I think it is harder sometimes to do<br/>\n&gt;   this while we are in the midst of being there with our young children because<br/>\n&gt;   we feel like we are the dike that keeps bad things from happening to them and<br/>\n&gt;   we need to be right so nothing goes wrong. Maybe we need a compass for Right<br/>\n&gt;   and Not Right at North and South, with Sure and Not Sure at points East and<br/>\n&gt;   West. ;) We think have so much to lose when we Aren&#39;t Right (usually because<br/>\n&gt;   that is how our own parents acted towards us) that we get caught up in the<br/>\n&gt;   either/or  black/white thinking about it instead of really finding solutions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ** Such a compass would be wonderful, but it would have to be an ever-changing-to-fit-the-situation compass, and I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll get that far advanced in my lifetime! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the whole point. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   The trouble or blessing with *today&#39;s* world is that those little rules of<br/>\n&gt;   etiquette that used to fit ALL occasions simply don&#39;t anymore. Sometimes the<br/>\n&gt;   &quot;nicest&quot; thing to do and the bravest and the most right is to stand up for<br/>\n&gt;   defenseless children and to quit protecting the feelings of the adult. Not to<br/>\n&gt;   kid oneself that not getting involved is going to protect a child with an<br/>\n&gt;   adult so out of control that they can&#39;t control their anger in public.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ** Why would you assume the adult is out of control or angry? The parents I know spank when certain things are done or not done by the child, no matter where they are, and they&#39;re not angry at all at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My point on the compass seems to be an adult who spanks in public is<br/>\nspanking in anger and losing it since that is what I have mostly<br/>\nobserved. They have already reached the end of their &quot;dealing with<br/>\nit&quot; techniques. Maybe this is a southern thing. The old days of<br/>\nwhipping slaves have left a terrible legacy in the South. Maybe the<br/>\npeople you meet on a day to day basis are so desensitized to other&#39;s<br/>\npain that it doesn&#39;t even touch their feeling meter. Maybe it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t touch yours. It still is violence and it still is wrong. And<br/>\nuntil one understands how hitting a child corrupts every other<br/>\ninteraction a parent has with that child I don&#39;t suppose one would<br/>\nunderstand. It is a lack of respect on so many deep levels. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   I&#39;ve talked to so many grown children who were abused when young and over and<br/>\n&gt;   over again they talk about the times when someone made a difference. It might<br/>\n&gt;   have been a teacher or an aunt or even a neighbor, but even if it only made<br/>\n&gt;   the abuser secretive and cautious it still let the child know that what was<br/>\n&gt;   happening to them was wrong and that not all adults acted that way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Peggy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ** My DH was abused as a child, and watched his mother being abused. He does not equate spanking with abuse in any way, shape, or form. A very good friend of mine was abused as a child, and watched his little sister die from being slammed head-first into a wall because she wouldn&#39;t stop crying. He also sees spanking as a discipline tool to be used selectively, when calm, and not abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just because some children are abused severely it doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>\nchildren who are abused less severely are not harmed. Hitting<br/>\nchildren is violence and it shuts down respect and feeling between<br/>\nthe parent and the child. It closes down communication and trust. It<br/>\nis Not Good even if it isn&#39;t maiming or death causing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   My point is, you CAN&#39;T know, unless a child is really being wallopped in obvious anger, what the family&#39;s standards of discipline are. It&#39;s not right to try to impose your own advice and judgements onto others, and causes a great deal more harm than good. Leave the parenting to the parents, whenever possible. When people are ready to find alternatives, they&#39;ll hunt for them. If they&#39;re not hunting already, you won&#39;t do a bit of good. It&#39;s like telling an alcholic that he needs to stop drinking.... you&#39;ll upset him and he&#39;ll stop listening to you after a while, and nothing will get him to stop drinking til he decides he wants to stop and reaches out for help.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The co-dependents view of life? Hitting children hurts and maims<br/>\nthem. Hurting children hurts society. They used to box children&#39;s<br/>\nears -- why don&#39;t we do that now? It was &quot;just parenting&quot; and you<br/>\nsay people ought to have the right to do that? They discovered it<br/>\nwas physically and emotionally harmful and suddenly everyone quit<br/>\nfeeling they had the right to grab the nearest kid and hit him on<br/>\nthe ears as hard as they could for some infraction.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are society.  We are the change that makes better lives possible<br/>\nfor all of us -- children too. Today&#39;s beaten and bullied and<br/>\nviolated child is tomorrow&#39;s abuser. We get it now. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yahoo! Groups SponsorADVERTISEMENT<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

The parents I know spank when certain things are done or not done by the child, no matter where they are, and they&#39;re not angry at all at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My point on the compass seems to be an adult who spanks in public is<br/>\nspanking in anger and losing it since that is what I have mostly<br/>\nobserved. They have already reached the end of their &quot;dealing with<br/>\nit&quot; techniques. Maybe this is a southern thing. The old days of<br/>\nwhipping slaves have left a terrible legacy in the South. Maybe the<br/>\npeople you meet on a day to day basis are so desensitized to other&#39;s<br/>\npain that it doesn&#39;t even touch their feeling meter. Maybe it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t touch yours. It still is violence and it still is wrong. And<br/>\nuntil one understands how hitting a child corrupts every other<br/>\ninteraction a parent has with that child I don&#39;t suppose one would<br/>\nunderstand. It is a lack of respect on so many deep levels. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   I&#39;ve talked to so many grown children who were abused when young and over and<br/>\n&gt;   over again they talk about the times when someone made a difference. It might<br/>\n&gt;   have been a teacher or an aunt or even a neighbor, but even if it only made<br/>\n&gt;   the abuser secretive and cautious it still let the child know that what was<br/>\n&gt;   happening to them was wrong and that not all adults acted that way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Peggy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ** My DH was abused as a child, and watched his mother being abused. He does not equate spanking with abuse in any way, shape, or form. A very good friend of mine was abused as a child, and watched his little sister die from being slammed head-first into a wall because she wouldn&#39;t stop crying. He also sees spanking as a discipline tool to be used selectively, when calm, and not abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just because some children are abused severely it doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>\nchildren who are abused less severely are not harmed. Hitting<br/>\nchildren is violence and it shuts down respect and feeling between<br/>\nthe parent and the child. It closes down communication and trust. It<br/>\nis Not Good even if it isn&#39;t maiming or death causing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   My point is, you CAN&#39;T know, unless a child is really being wallopped in obvious anger, what the family&#39;s standards of discipline are. It&#39;s not right to try to impose your own advice and judgements onto others, and causes a great deal more harm than good. Leave the parenting to the parents, whenever possible. When people are ready to find alternatives, they&#39;ll hunt for them. If they&#39;re not hunting already, you won&#39;t do a bit of good. It&#39;s like telling an alcholic that he needs to stop drinking.... you&#39;ll upset him and he&#39;ll stop listening to you after a while, and nothing will get him to stop drinking til he decides he wants to stop and reaches out for help.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The co-dependents view of life? Hitting children hurts and maims<br/>\nthem. Hurting children hurts society. They used to box children&#39;s<br/>\nears -- why don&#39;t we do that now? It was &quot;just parenting&quot; and you<br/>\nsay people ought to have the right to do that? They discovered it<br/>\nwas physically and emotionally harmful and suddenly everyone quit<br/>\nfeeling they had the right to grab the nearest kid and hit him on<br/>\nthe ears as hard as they could for some infraction.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are society.  We are the change that makes better lives possible<br/>\nfor all of us -- children too. Today&#39;s beaten and bullied and<br/>\nviolated child is tomorrow&#39;s abuser. We get it now. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] doing nothing/denial","postDate":"1035314216","msgId":47330,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJjLjJkZTlmYjJjLjJhZTZmZTI4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47329,"nextInTopic":47332,"prevInTime":47329,"nextInTime":47331,"topicId":47274,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/22/02 12:50:18 PM, myrandab@bellsouth.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-641627082\">In a message dated 10/22/02 12:50:18 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:myrandab@...\">myrandab@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; A parent who spanks when the child does something that could hurt them or <br/>\nothers is very much accepted and even expected in many families.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the little girl had been uncooperative in the library.

Maybe them seeing things in practice would make much more of an impact than just your talking to them does. My DH is quick to raise his voice, and he&#39;s gotten to where he&#39;ll look to me when he starts getting upset for ideas on what else he can do. For example, when the mom yelled about the fridge, you could say &quot;Usually it&#39;s nice to ask people before you start moving their things around, but I&#39;m family so it&#39;s ok when you&#39;re here, let&#39;s find a place for your pretty picture and tell mommy to come look&quot;. That would address any concerns that mom might have about her messing with your things (since she&#39;s new to the family she&#39;s probably not all the way comfortable with you yet), and show and include mom in the nice thing to do and way to act, and give her a chance to ooh and ah over the pic and get her girl&#39;s happiness with her back. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n <br/>\n  From: Kimber <br/>\n  I have a situation that arose in our family.  My brother-in-law (28) recently married (she&#39;s 22) someone who has a 3y/o daughter.  It seems that she hasn&#39;t had much parenting experience....she spends little time with her daughter because her mother(the grandmother) has custody and the girl&#39;s father gets her every other weekend.  Well, she is now pregnant with my nephew and the really bad news is that he has known birth defects which will have to be corrected at birth (omphalocele).  The stress she is under is more than I will ever know.  But.....she spanks her 3 y/o constantly.  They have been to our home about 5 or 6 times and each and every time, 3 y/o gets spanked or swatted for touching things (toys), not cleaning her plate, or saying &#39;no&#39;.  Now, my house is not a shrine.  I am a neat freak, I admit, but there is absolutely nothing within her reach that is off limits.  I learned a long time ago that it is so much easier to put my &#39;pretties&#39; (breakables) up high so I won&#39;t worry about them.  My sil knows this as I tell her every visit.  She still continues to try to keep her 3 y/o in line.  Another example is the last time they were here, my niece colored a picture and wanted it on the fridge with all of the others my kids had done.  She starts looking for an available magnet, starts shifting papers on the fridge, ........instantly her mother screams, &quot;Quit messing with that!!&quot;  All she wanted was a spot with the others.  I was so sad for her.  I then told her, &quot;lets see if we can find you a good place&quot;, and she beamed. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, I have talked to my bil about how we feel about spanking, how we tried it and it didn&#39;t work.  He has seen how our parenting styles have changed over time but I doubt he has paid much attention.....he&#39;s only been a father for 4 months.  I have tried my best to point out other ways of parenting to him, mainly by example, without being a smarty pants or a know-it-all.  I have stated that, &quot;this works for us...you might try it.&quot; kind of advice.  He hasn&#39;t seemed offended by suggestions/advice because I think now he realizes how difficult parenting can be and is a little overwhelmed by his new life.  He was a bacholor, never married, no girl friend for about 1 1/2 years before his wife, a party kind of guy who is now ready to &#39;be a grown up&#39;.  For his birthday about 6 weeks ago, I gave him a copy of _The Natural Child_ which I had just read and thought was wonderful.  I put a little note in the front about how I wish I had received this book when my son was a baby.  The last time we were together, he still hadn&#39;t read it and I don&#39;t know about his wife.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess, I am looking for input on what to do next.  Have I already gone too far?  They both ask for advice, seem receptive to our replies, but nothing seems to change.  Again, they are under a lot of stress right now with the new baby coming (due Dec.) but my (new)niece shouldn&#39;t have to suffer because of it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  The grandmother, whom I have met, seems very controlling, manipulative, harsh, she yells a lot, spanks, oh...and she is a teacher (4 year olds).  It&#39;s no wonder my sil has bad habits.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kimber  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Sometimes the<br/>\n  &quot;nicest&quot; thing to do and the bravest and the most right is to stand up for<br/>\n  defenseless children and to quit protecting the feelings of the adult. Not to<br/>\n  kid oneself that not getting involved is going to protect a child with an<br/>\n  adult so out of control that they can&#39;t control their anger in public. <br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Why would you assume the adult is out of control or angry? The parents I know spank when certain things are done or not done by the child, no matter where they are, and they&#39;re not angry at all at the time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve talked to so many grown children who were abused when young and over and<br/>\n  over again they talk about the times when someone made a difference. It might<br/>\n  have been a teacher or an aunt or even a neighbor, but even if it only made<br/>\n  the abuser secretive and cautious it still let the child know that what was<br/>\n  happening to them was wrong and that not all adults acted that way. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Peggy<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** My DH was abused as a child, and watched his mother being abused. He does not equate spanking with abuse in any way, shape, or form. A very good friend of mine was abused as a child, and watched his little sister die from being slammed head-first into a wall because she wouldn&#39;t stop crying. He also sees spanking as a discipline tool to be used selectively, when calm, and not abuse. <br/>\n<br/>\n  My point is, you CAN&#39;T know, unless a child is really being wallopped in obvious anger, what the family&#39;s standards of discipline are. It&#39;s not right to try to impose your own advice and judgements onto others, and causes a great deal more harm than good. Leave the parenting to the parents, whenever possible. When people are ready to find alternatives, they&#39;ll hunt for them. If they&#39;re not hunting already, you won&#39;t do a bit of good. It&#39;s like telling an alcholic that he needs to stop drinking.... you&#39;ll upset him and he&#39;ll stop listening to you after a while, and nothing will get him to stop drinking til he decides he wants to stop and reaches out for help. <br/>\n  Myranda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1512150,"authorName":"Peggy","from":"Peggy &lt;peggy@...&gt;","profile":"margotapple","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] calling the police vs. doing nothing","postDate":"1035309585","msgId":47311,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEQjU5MjExLkNGMjU3ODY4QGxpbm1heC5zYW8uYXJpem9uYS5lZHU+","referencesHeader":"PDFjNC42YjliNGMuMmFlNmM5NDFAYW9sLmNvbT4gPDA3ZjIwMWMyNzllOCQyNjJmNDFjMCQwMTNmZmVhOUBjb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":47308,"nextInTopic":47315,"prevInTime":47310,"nextInTime":47312,"topicId":47274,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Then it was worth it.  In every instance where I&#39;ve seen spanking, (and I know I&#39;ll get slammed for this)the adult has very low self-esteem or low self-worth and doesn&#39;t know that there are other ways to guide and rear our children.  I spanked my oldest when he was 2 or 3 and I could tell, it was not improving the situation at all so I stopped.  But, some people can not get their emotions in check to see that its not helping.     I could go on and on. <br/>\n<br/>\n  The sad thing is that even when it is in our families, alot of people will still, not say anything....denial is  HUGE and it seems to be everywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Maybe they don&#39;t say anything because there really is not a need for anything to be said? A parent who spanks when the child does something that could hurt them or others is very much accepted and even expected in many families.

My brother-in-law (28) recently married (she&#39;s 22) someone who has a 3y/o daughter.  It seems that she hasn&#39;t had much parenting experience....she spends little time with her daughter because her mother(the grandmother) has custody and the girl&#39;s father gets her every other weekend.  Well, she is now pregnant with my nephew and the really bad news is that he has known birth defects which will have to be corrected at birth (omphalocele).  The stress she is under is more than I will ever know.  But.....she spanks her 3 y/o constantly.  They have been to our home about 5 or 6 times and each and every time, 3 y/o gets spanked or swatted for touching things (toys), not cleaning her plate, or saying &#39;no&#39;.  Now, my house is not a shrine.  I am a neat freak, I admit, but there is absolutely nothing within her reach that is off limits.  I learned a long time ago that it is so much easier to put my &#39;pretties&#39; (breakables) up high so I won&#39;t worry about them.  My sil knows this as I tell her every visit.  She still continues to try to keep her 3 y/o in line.  Another example is the last time they were here, my niece colored a picture and wanted it on the fridge with all of the others my kids had done.  She starts looking for an available magnet, starts shifting papers on the fridge, ........instantly her mother screams, &quot;Quit messing with that!!&quot;  All she wanted was a spot with the others.  I was so sad for her.  I then told her, &quot;lets see if we can find you a good place&quot;, and she beamed. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I have talked to my bil about how we feel about spanking, how we tried it and it didn&#39;t work.  He has seen how our parenting styles have changed over time but I doubt he has paid much attention.....he&#39;s only been a father for 4 months.  I have tried my best to point out other ways of parenting to him, mainly by example, without being a smarty pants or a know-it-all.  I have stated that, &quot;this works for us...you might try it.&quot; kind of advice.  He hasn&#39;t seemed offended by suggestions/advice because I think now he realizes how difficult parenting can be and is a little overwhelmed by his new life.  He was a bacholor, never married, no girl friend for about 1 1/2 years before his wife, a party kind of guy who is now ready to &#39;be a grown up&#39;.  For his birthday about 6 weeks ago, I gave him a copy of _The Natural Child_ which I had just read and thought was wonderful.  I put a little note in the front about how I wish I had received this book when my son was a baby.  The last time we were together, he still hadn&#39;t read it and I don&#39;t know about his wife.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess, I am looking for input on what to do next.  Have I already gone too far?  They both ask for advice, seem receptive to our replies, but nothing seems to change.  Again, they are under a lot of stress right now with the new baby coming (due Dec.) but my (new)niece shouldn&#39;t have to suffer because of it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe grandmother, whom I have met, seems very controlling, manipulative, harsh, she yells a lot, spanks, oh...and she is a teacher (4 year olds).  It&#39;s no wonder my sil has bad habits.<br/>\n<br/>\nKimber  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] doing nothing/denial","postDate":"1035308341","msgId":47308,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDIyMTczOTAxLjc0NDkzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA3ZjIwMWMyNzllOCQyNjJmNDFjMCQwMTNmZmVhOUBjb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":47296,"nextInTopic":47311,"prevInTime":47307,"nextInTime":47309,"topicId":47274,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m sorry, but if we always wanted to say something nice ,  people that are hurting their children would never be stopped.
