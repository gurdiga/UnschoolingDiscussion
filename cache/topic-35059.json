I have an office, but it is<br/>\nopen to the house and the kids often play in here with me, as they<br/>\nare doing right now. They are playing some addition game seeing<br/>\nwho can answer 6 + 6 the fastest (giving the littlest a turn even if <br/>\nhe isn&#39;t the fastest).<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;The kids are very well trained to <br/>\n freeze when the business phone rings and pause any activity until I&#39;m <br/>\n done.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow in the heck did you do that?  No matter what, the phone rings,<br/>\nI holler QUIET and they &quot;usually&quot; simmer down.  Dh often takes his<br/>\ncalls outside too LOL.  And my youngest, just doesn&#39;t get it when<br/>\nI am on the phone, will come up to me with a request, used to be<br/>\nfull volume, now he just whispers loudly LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I&#39;m glad we struck out and did our own thing, but some days I&#39;d love <br/>\n to have some company  medical insurance or retirement plan.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some alternatives available in terms of medical coverage. For<br/>\ninstance in CA we have Blue Cross which offers a major medical<br/>\nplan. So if you go to the hospital or urgent care you are covered <br/>\n80/20 like many plans with a deductible of your choice ($1000 for<br/>\nus).  You only pay that deductible the first year if you are <br/>\ndiagnosed with an illness that needs repeated treatment. Office<br/>\nvisits you pay for which can be a concern as many things are<br/>\ngoing to outpatient visits.  Since we do everything alternative,<br/>\nhomebirth, naturopath, chiro & homeopathy, that stuff is seldom<br/>\ncovered or if it is you still have to pay 50% anyhow so why<br/>\nincrease your premiums to $400 a month to cover a $50 or $75<br/>\nvisit once a year?  You can also invest in an IRA for yourself and<br/>\nyour husband.  We incorporated and have reaped many tax <br/>\nbenefits, we can also now offer ourselves retirement plans<br/>\n(being an employee of the corporation we offer it to all our<br/>\nemployees, including ourselves) and other health insurance<br/>\noptions.  Actually, we are investing in real estate as our retirement<br/>\nplan. But thats a whole &#39;nother story (and business) &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to answer the other mom regarding how we unschool with<br/>\na business, I would say it flows really nicely here. I have three<br/>\nkids who play together all the time.  I work on Mondays and<br/>\nseveral years ago I started hiring office help. I don&#39;t want to<br/>\ndo a lot of that stuff anymore and have other business projects<br/>\nin the works.  Doing the repetitive is too time consuming for me now<br/>\na days. But I still talk to customers and collect money (gotta<br/>\nhave my finger in that pie &lt;g&gt;) and the customers like me<br/>\nand dh.  I think they often hire us because we are a nice family<br/>\nworking together.  The kids go on our errands, many customers<br/>\nhave watched our kids grow.  As they get older they will have<br/>\nthe opportunity to do more and learn more if they so choose.  <br/>\nI should clarify, I don&#39;t just work on Mondays but that is the day<br/>\nthat I really focus and that my assistant comes in. I work on<br/>\nand off every day of the week but only a few minutes or hours <br/>\nhere and there.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;You give up certain securities in exchange for certain freedoms that <br/>\n running your own business allows.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNot necessarily. There are no guarantees when working for someone <br/>\nelse that you will always have a job.

I learned how to do it while Liam was in-arms <br/>\nbecause we (DH and I) knew that I was not going to go back to full-time, <br/>\noutside-the-house work and stick Liam in some kind of daycare scene.  We&#39;re <br/>\nboth musicians but in order to make a real good living we would have to be <br/>\ntraveling a lot and away from home a lot and neither of us wanted to do <br/>\nthat while Liam was really young.  So, DH teaches privately and works at a <br/>\nlocal college and I sit at home and type.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes this so challenging is that medical transcription requires my <br/>\nfull attention while I&#39;m doing it.  I can look off out the window to see a <br/>\nbird or something like that for a moment, but my ears, my brain, and my <br/>\nbody are committed while I&#39;m working.  And, because I am paid by <br/>\nproduction, it behooves me to get my work done without interruption, <br/>\nwhenever I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to do most of my work before Liam gets up in the morning, so I&#39;ll get <br/>\nup around 2 or 3 in the morning and type like a maniac, but sometimes I&#39;m <br/>\njust too tired or there is no work available at that time.  There are lots <br/>\nof times when I have to work while he&#39;s awake, and then it&#39;s just breaks my <br/>\nheart.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe only just got a television set when we took him out of school (we never <br/>\nhad one before), and while we don&#39;t get cable and there&#39;s no reception, we <br/>\nborrow video tapes from the library.  He loves things like Power Rangers <br/>\nand Star Wars, and Scooby Doo is his favorite.  He has to watch these by <br/>\nhimself, though, and it makes me sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s very understanding about my work, but it still feels challenging to <br/>\nme.  This is all very new to us, and all he wants to do is play.  There are <br/>\nnot a lot of kids around (well, none, really) during the day during school <br/>\nhours, and playing with other kids is what he craves.  So, he plays with <br/>\nhis Legos and makes up interesting dramas with his toys and he uses his <br/>\ncomputer quite a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, Liam has lost none of his baby teeth yet, although he&#39;s <br/>\napproaching 7-1/2 years of age.  I often wonder about the correlation <br/>\nbetween that and his readiness for more &quot;academic&quot; learning.  He&#39;s totally <br/>\nnot into it.  He knows that I&#39;m not going to push him in any way, and he <br/>\nfeels safe at home (which makes me so glad!).  I wonder if anyone else has <br/>\nhad experiences with this type of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the answers!<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"gruvystarchild","from":"&quot;gruvystarchild&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: working from home","postDate":"1018990375","msgId":35141,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE5aTJ2NytnbGRwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGI5LjFmMGJhNTdhLjI5ZWRhYWRjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35059,"nextInTopic":35150,"prevInTime":35140,"nextInTime":35142,"topicId":35059,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... . ... from anyone ... in your ...
