So, <br/>\nperhaps gangsta rap is best enjoyed by those who don&#39;t have to personally <br/>\ndeal with the reality that fuels the lyrics.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is brilliant and true. Indeed, when the safe and protected children of <br/>\nanointed families spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year to <br/>\nentertain themselves on the pornography that is rap music, clearly the <br/>\nchickens have yet to come home to roost. But when white and wealthy Johnny <br/>\nskips karate class or soccer and instead rapes the 12 year old girl down the <br/>\nroad, &quot;keepin&#39; it real&quot; like the &quot;homies&quot; he respects so much on his CD&#39;s, <br/>\nthen Mom and Dad will have to deal with the reality. But for now ... <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is Stanley Crouch: &quot;Snarling racial alienation is just one more item on <br/>\nthe adolescent shopping list. The suburban white kid in search of savages <br/>\nnoble and ignoble doesn&#39;t have to apply for a passport, put on a pith helmet, <br/>\nget inoculations, purchase expensive plane tickets, hire a guide, buy <br/>\nmosquito netting, and the rest of it. All he or she has to do is go to the <br/>\nrecord shop or turn on cable television. The alienated white adolescent then <br/>\nsymbolically reaches down to pat the cap turned backwards on the head of the <br/>\nblack commodity that has expressed &#39;rock-n-roll anarchy&#39; to a fare-the-well. <br/>\nIvory and ebony, ebony and ivory. They have worked it out. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In essence, the cable television executives and the record producers are no <br/>\ndifferent than the South American drug lords who reside in palaces and on <br/>\ngrounds that are paeans to overstatement while supplying the powders that <br/>\nincrease the desperation and speed the decay of the slums. These developments <br/>\nare as harrowing as the biracial cooperation that was essential to the slave <br/>\ntrade. We observe the white captains of media industry profiting from the <br/>\nmarketing of the ethos of the black pirates of the streets.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCrouch tells us that, &quot;[F]or the bulk of white rap fans, the surliest rap <br/>\nrecordings and videos [will] function as experiences somewhere between <br/>\nviewing the natives boiling the middle class in a pot of profanity and the <br/>\nthrill of gawking at a killer shark in an audio aquarium.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd interpreted what you wrote as if you were saying that you <br/>\nconsider a different sort of music ought to be &quot;imposed&quot; upon those living <br/>\nrough lives. But hope that the gangsta rap music establishment -- and the <br/>\npathologies that fuel it -- might someday crumble, is no &quot;imposition&quot; of <br/>\nwhatever music might take its place. Moreover, the lifting up of norms and <br/>\nstandards of behavior and art is also no &quot;imposition.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers at this list seem to see the refusal to allow such pornography into <br/>\none&#39;s home as an unacceptable form of censorship. (&quot;It may offend you, but <br/>\nyour child may see something different in it.&quot;) If rape, racism, misogyny, <br/>\ndrug use, and violent hatred are evils for everyone, everywhere, and at all <br/>\ntimes, then those who are entertained by as much ought to be ashamed of <br/>\nthemselves. That the odd child may have a sociological attraction to such <br/>\nthings is something different altogether and also very rare.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw nowhere in your post that you are &quot;refusing to listen to expressions of <br/>\nfrustration&quot; found in your community. But Sandra Dodd saw it, and reminds us <br/>\nthat &quot;refusing to listen to expressions of frustration doesn&#39;t lessen the <br/>\nfrustration.&quot; Has it crossed her mind that refusing to listen may take the <br/>\nprofit out of the frustration, and convince a generation of *human beings* <br/>\nthat it&#39;s high time they aspired to behave as such? That the &quot;underclass&quot; <br/>\nwith its sociopaths have become museum pieces for more enlightened <br/>\nhomeschoolers to study doesn&#39;t lessen the imperative.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd asked, &quot;Would there be less violence without the accompanying <br/>\nmusic?&quot; It&#39;s a good question, but one that doesn&#39;t demand a cut and dry <br/>\nanswer in order for change to happen.  Whether or not the lifestyle or the <br/>\nmusic ought to go first is beside the point. They both fuel each other, and <br/>\nfor those suffering from the exploitation, it matters not which part first <br/>\nshuts down, but only that it ends.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gangsta culture is just that -- a culture, with its own art, rules, <br/>\ntaboos, goals, norms, and visions. Consider the place that rap music <br/>\ncurrently holds in our society, and then ask yourself if the gangsta life <br/>\nhasn&#39;t been an astronomical success, for both its protagonists and their <br/>\nchroniclers? Change will not come from within.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a simple answer, though it requires that we slip out from under the <br/>\ncomfortable liberal and relativistic vision, and face truth. Again, Stanley <br/>\nCrouch: &quot;What must be done is rather obvious. The values of civilized <br/>\nbehavior must be reestablished and defined as fundamental beyond race. No one <br/>\nin this society should be encouraged to believe that excellence, mastery of <br/>\nour national language, tasteful dress, reliability, or any of the virtues <br/>\nthat bring vitality to a society are the sole province of the white <br/>\npopulation.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my post is offensive, or insulting, so be it.
