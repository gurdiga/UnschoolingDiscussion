When my kids say they are bored, I always show that I&#39;m<br/>\npleased and explain that means something wonderful is brewing in their<br/>\nbrains.  I truly believe that and after several years, the kids also believe<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen any kid is coming out of school and into unschooling, they don&#39;t really<br/>\nknow WHAT to do with themselves.  I always suggest the mom do some things<br/>\nthat interest HER and allow for the child to come along for the ride.  What<br/>\nwould you just love to do?  Gardening?  Pottery?  Breeding rabbits?<br/>\nTraining the dog?  Making soap?  Whatever.  As you open the doors for<br/>\nyourself, he will be allowed to peek in as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as a former TV limiter, I understand your concerns about the<br/>\ncomputer....but the kids truly do get tired of them and move on to other<br/>\nthings, while the TV or games can be a spring board to many of those other<br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37253,"nextTopicId":37268}}
