I often tell<br/>\npeople that I think teens take a lot more time than younger kids do.  Or maybe<br/>\nit&#39;s just a different kind of time that takes a lot more out of me?  It&#39;s less<br/>\nshowing and explaining the &quot;facts&quot; and a lot more agonizing over the whys and<br/>\nwherefores.  I can&#39;t begin to add of the number of hours we&#39;ve spent talking<br/>\nand talking over things.  And it takes a lot more of my thinking time, both<br/>\nduring and after the conversations.  Lots of questions for the younger years<br/>\nwere &quot;two minute flybys&quot;; these questions are more like two hour - or two day<br/>\n- in depth, soul searching things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, maybe your theory isn&#39;t totally blown &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n<br/>\nFriend of Ishmael<br/>\nThe world shines bright with endless possibilities each time a child is born.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Cats Meow","from":"&quot;Cats Meow&quot; &lt;lturner@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"9IjSy4lt0J2z6FXD-e74x-aIfvBCwVZVwcorq0ZgXH-lmcqQuZlPpPDmZE5ZemFQx7oVW5RLb_f1cHyPeTzY4TzZhhs","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"But what do I do?","postDate":"930768797","msgId":1372,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xMDIuMTM3Mi45NTkyNjk3NDBAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1373,"prevInTime":1371,"nextInTime":1373,"topicId":1372,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks everyone for your great responses to my question- I m beginning to see the incredible oportunity for me to follow my own interests and be a true example","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1880955290\">Thanks everyone for your great responses to my question- I&#39;m beginning to<br/>\nsee the incredible oportunity for me to follow my own interests and be a<br/>\ntrue example of unschooling myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen- &lt;&lt;What makes the schooled side of you think they&#39;re not already<br/>\nlearning plenty?&gt;&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I was the &quot;good&quot; student- on the honor roll, strict British school<br/>\nsystem- grades and tests were everything. I can see that my children are<br/>\nlearning a lot, but not necessarily the things that society says they are<br/>\nsupposed to. In my heart I know that times tables are not essential to my<br/>\nnine-year old&#39;s being right now, but my head is still nervous about it:).<br/>\nIt&#39;s very hard to move away from that mindset. Zoe has incredible gifts in<br/>\nareas I consider more important than academics, but next to her public<br/>\nschool friends, she is not reading on her own, her math skills are not as<br/>\nstrong, we haven&#39;t even begun on foreign languages, on and on. And<br/>\nsometimes, knowing that she is wonderful with animals and gifted in<br/>\ndrawing, doesn&#39;t quell my fears that I need to be teaching her more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with your comment about making oneself available during certain<br/>\nhours- not for me either. I guess I don&#39;t really have a problem knowing<br/>\nwhat to do with myself- I just feel guilty about it! When I look at those<br/>\naround me- always stressed out to get their kids somewhere- I just smile<br/>\nand think how I&#39;ve got it made. We have an amazingly peaceful life. But I<br/>\ndo feel guilty because my husband is out working a not so wonderful job so<br/>\nthat I can be here with the girls. I have to work on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks again for the discussion- you are all so inspiring:).<br/>\n<br/>\nLyn<br/>\nPS Thanks Diane for blowing my theory that they will need me more as they<br/>\nget older!!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jeff & Diane Gwirtz","from":"&quot;Jeff & Diane Gwirtz&quot; &lt;jagwirtz@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"v5efYxZ4BhTfmX_FoLksq-rh_8_Q6wTUYhsa8CFSG0wJdjBXSAaCd8wX255pCOr1ZBKaa3-cgZonwJ7ci28GAFOoQsRoyLB_OuwE2wqiqg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: But what do I do?","postDate":"930752664","msgId":1373,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xMDIuMTM3My45NTkyNjk3NDBAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":1372,"nextInTopic":1377,"prevInTime":1372,"nextInTime":1374,"topicId":1372,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
