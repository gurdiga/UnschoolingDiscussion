Recently he read The Hobbit. He loves Garfield comics, Animorphs and Hank the Cowdog. He&#39;s also listening to A Wrinkle in Time. He also reads software and game manuals until their covers are tattered and their pages are falling out.   I think when left to his own choices, he needs a variety each day with a day here and there engrossed in one thing, to make him happy.

They were my first fat hard back books and were such a great escape.  I hadn&#39;t been completely conscious of how much I had expected my children to be like this until I read Sandra&#39;s article in this month&#39;s HEM magazine and I realized that i sooo have a picture, still, of home schooling being about lots of time to read without interruption.  I hated being called to dinner because I would have to put down my book.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI have always read to them a lot and they have asked for it as well.  This past year, before coming here, I had established daily &quot;reading time&quot; (based on a book by Lucy Calkins) when they would pick out lots of books and we would cuddle up in bed or on the couch and read for an hour.  It could happen any time of day. I never scheduled it in, (well, I guess evey day is a schedule &lt;g&gt; ) but I did strongly encourage it to happen.   After just a few weeks, reading had suddenly become a Mommy expectation, another power struggle.   Now that I have given all that up, they are slowly starting to bring me books again during the day.  We do read to them every night before bed but they love that.  We are really into Roald Dahl&#39;s shorter books, like George&#39;s Marvelous Medicine, and The Giraffe the Pelly and Me.  Also, I read somewhere that boys like nonfiction and joke books a lot.  Girls, for the most part are suposedly into fiction more. We go to the library every week and they get lots of<br/>\n all kinds but the non fiction dinosaur books are my three yr. old boy&#39;s favorites and the non fiction animal, sports and joke books are the oldest boy&#39;s favorites.   The older one is starting to want to sound out words, very few and verysporadically and I am not doing anything unless asked.  I did too much all year and am shocked he has any interest in it now!    And yes, we do (as of last month) allow mostly unrestricted TV.  It&#39;s Summer and they are very into being outside and running around so I haven&#39;t had to deal with the TV watching much.  Just a few days of a few hours in a row and I learned that I could survive it fine, even enjoy it with them!  I love TV and I don&#39;t watch that much so why did i assume that was all they would do?<br/>\n <br/>\nMadeline<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!

He <br/>\nhas always loved to read.. never been limited on TV.. he watched a lot when he <br/>\nwas younger, but still liked reading better.

He will avoid it at all costs.   He can read, he just does not enjoy it at <br/>\nall.  He loves TV, computer and video games.    He has gaming magazines and <br/>\nsuch, but he just looks at the pictures or asks me to read the articles to him <br/>\nif he is interested.   My 8 yo son is a lot like my dd, he can take or leave <br/>\nreading.   If there is a book he really likes, he will read it over and over.  <br/>\nBut, lots of times I offer to read to him or listen to him read, he declines.  <br/>\nHe does still perfer me to read aloud to him over him reading to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I love books and I love to read.  My oldest son is most like me in that <br/>\nregard.  My other children&#39;s &quot;less than enthusiastic&quot;  ideas about reading do not <br/>\ncome from too much TV, a non-supportive reading environment, or lack of <br/>\nresources.  It is just part of thier personalities, thier dispostions.    I think <br/>\nlove of reading is inherent, like love of animals or gardening.   There is not <br/>\nmuch influence folks have as far as &quot;making&quot; kids love to read.    Yeah, you <br/>\ncan make someone HATE to read by forcing it on them or shaming them for not <br/>\nbeing proficient at it.    <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] books preferred","postDate":"1056830359","msgId":75673,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDcwMWMzM2RhZiRjNjkxN2IyMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PFNlYTItRjQxbjc5NE4xeFVaZU4wMDAwNWFlN0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":75672,"nextInTopic":75692,"prevInTime":75672,"nextInTime":75674,"topicId":75672,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... does not limit TV, ...

After spending time on this list, I realize<br/>\nthat I was placing some limits on their tv, but I can honestly say that<br/>\nthey&#39;ve never had strict limits such as so many hours per day or not being<br/>\nallowed to watch certain things.  It has been about 1 1/2 years since I&#39;ve<br/>\nremoved all limits.<br/>\n<br/>\n7yod doesn&#39;t read on her own, but loves to be read to and listen to books on<br/>\ntape and watch tv/movies.  She has listened to many books that would be<br/>\nconsidered way above her reading/listening level by those who pay attention<br/>\nto that classification.  Right now, her dad is reading to her, Golf My Way<br/>\nby Jack Nicholson.  Maybe not a *classic*, but certainly not the typical<br/>\nbedtime story for a 7 yo.<br/>\n<br/>\n10yod was reading at about 6 1/2 and reads an incredible amount and variety<br/>\non her own and also still loves to have me read aloud to her and to read<br/>\naloud to me.  She reads both fiction and non-fiction on her own and chooses<br/>\nboth typical and non-typical books for her age.  I have never had any rules<br/>\non what they should read.  I have discussed fiction vs non-fiction in terms<br/>\nof just explaining the difference, but have never suggested that one is<br/>\nbetter or more important to read than another.  I belong to an adult book<br/>\nclub and 10yod is fascinated and asks me all sorts of questions about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth my kids also enjoy watching tv.  I was raised watching tv and loving to<br/>\nread.  I probably watch the least amount of tv in my family, because I have<br/>\nlots of books I&#39;d like to get to.  But I honestly wish I had more time to<br/>\nwatch tv/movies.  There is so much great stuff to experience in that medium.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes something a classic anyway?  Should everyone in the world read<br/>\nall of Shakespeare and Dickens and Hawkings and the Bible and Asimov and<br/>\nLewis and EB White and Silverstein and every other great book ever written<br/>\nand read them all by the age of 18?  I certainly think that the more we know<br/>\nabout various things, the more we *get* from conversations in which tidbits<br/>\ncome up from various literature, history, or ancient myth.  But it is<br/>\nimpossible for any one person to know everything.  We do not have to know<br/>\neverything there is to know before we turn 18 and it would be impossible<br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3979435,"authorName":"Annette Naake","from":"&quot;Annette Naake&quot; &lt;naake1999@...&gt;","profile":"naake1999","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"books preferred","postDate":"1056828459","msgId":75672,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFNlYTItRjQxbjc5NE4xeFVaZU4wMDAwNWFlN0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":75673,"prevInTime":75671,"nextInTime":75673,"topicId":75672,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I can identify with this sentiment, actually...

However, I <br/>\nknow families (schooled and home/unschooled) who do limit, either by not <br/>\nhaving some of the options or by agreeing beforehand on when the screen goes <br/>\non or off. And their not-yet-teen boys are avid  readers -- some are into <br/>\ncomic books, others read kids&#39; chapter books like RL Stine, Harry Potter and <br/>\nHardy Boys, one is reading classic fiction (ie, Dickens, Twain). (In fact, <br/>\nwhen I was a kid, my parents limited strictly, and I had read classic <br/>\nfiction by the time I was 11 or 12.) Meanwhile, mine (10 and 6 -- 6yo is not <br/>\na reader yet) are watching Disney Channel and Nickelodeon or playing <br/>\n&quot;Zelda&quot;! My question is, is there anyone out there who does not limit TV, <br/>\netc., and has kids, esp. boys, who would prefer to read?
