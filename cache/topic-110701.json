Pat (dh) thinks he is cursed by our new cribbage board.  He used to ALWAYS win when we played together, but he hasn&#39;t won a single game on the new board that has 4 tracks.  He has played cribbage for years and the girls just learned how to play a few months ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nJackie and I have talked about the way we look for combinations of 15 when we play.  For instance, if I see a 6, 4, and 5, I think, &quot;6+4=10+5=15&quot;.  She thinks, &quot;4+5=9+6=15&quot;.  She also has very interesting ways of calculating numbers in her head - but she is far better at it than I am!  I need paper for more than the simplest calculations.

Looks like this:<br/>\n  0 9<br/>\n  1 8<br/>\n  2 7<br/>\n  3 6<br/>\n  4 5<br/>\n  5 4<br/>\n  6 3<br/>\n  7 2<br/>\n  8 1<br/>\n  9 0<br/>\n   <br/>\n  As you can see, the first number goes up and the second goes down, one each.

Why do  <br/>\n&quot;divisibility rules&quot; work?<br/>\n<br/>\n3<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the sum of the digits is divisible by three, the number is also<br/>\n<br/>\n4<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the last two digits are divisible by 4, the number is also<br/>\n<br/>\n5<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the last digit is a 5 or a 0, the number is divisible by 5.<br/>\n<br/>\n6<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the number is divisible by both 3 and 2, it is also divisible by 6.<br/>\n<br/>\n7<br/>\n<br/>\nTake the last digit, double it, and subtract it from the rest of the  <br/>\nnumber; if the answer is divisible by 7 (including 0), then the  <br/>\nnumber is also<br/>\n<br/>\n8<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the last three digits are divisible by 8, the number is also<br/>\n<br/>\n9<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the sum of the digits is divisible by 9, the number is also. *This  <br/>\nholds for any power of 3<br/>\n<br/>\n10<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the number ends in 0, it is divisible by 10.<br/>\n<br/>\n11<br/>\n<br/>\nSubtract the sum of the even digits from the sum of the odd digits;  <br/>\nif the difference, including 0, is divisible by 11, the number is also.<br/>\n<br/>\n12<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the number is divisible by both 3 and 4, it is also divisible by 12.<br/>\n<br/>\n13<br/>\n<br/>\nDelete the last digit from the number, then subtract 9 times the  <br/>\ndeleted digit from the remaining number. If what is left is divisible  <br/>\nby 13, then so is the original number.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do these &#39;rules&#39; work?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDividing by 3<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd up the digits: if the sum is divisible by three, then the number  <br/>\nis as well. Examples:<br/>\n<br/>\n111111: the digits add to 6 so the whole number is divisible by three.<br/>\n87687687. The digits add up to 57, and 5 plus seven is 12, so the  <br/>\noriginal number is divisible by three.<br/>\nWhy does the &#39;divisibility by 3&#39; rule work?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only way that I can think of to explain this would be as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at a 2 digit number: 10a+b=9a+(a+b). We know that 9a is  <br/>\ndivisible by 3, so 10a+b will be divisible by 3 if and only if a+b is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, 100a+10b+c=99a+9b+(a+b+c), and 99a+9b is divisible by 3,  <br/>\nso the total will be iff a+b+c is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis explanation also works to prove the divisibility by 9 test. It  <br/>\nclearly originates from modular arithmetic ideas, and I&#39;m not sure if  <br/>\nit&#39;s simple enough, but it&#39;s the only explanation I can think of.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoctor Darren, The Math Forum<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDividing by 4 and 8<br/>\n<br/>\nSince 100, 1000 and so on are multiples of 4, it follows (as for 2)  <br/>\nthat a number is divisible by 4 if the number represented by its last  <br/>\ntwo digits is a multiple of 4. Example: 3728 is a divisible by 4  <br/>\nbecause 28 is.<br/>\n<br/>\nPowers of 10 from 1000 on are divisible by 8, therefore it follows  <br/>\nthat a number is divisible by 8 if the number represented by its last  <br/>\nthree digits is a multiple of 8. Example: 3728 is a divisible by 8  <br/>\nbecause 728 is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDividing by 11<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s look at 352, which is divisible by 11; the answer is 32. 3+2 is  <br/>\n5; another way to say this is that 35 -2 is 33.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow look at 3531, which is also divisible by 11. It is not a  <br/>\ncoincidence that 353-1 is 352 and 11 x 321 is 3531.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a generalization of this system. Let&#39;s look at the number  <br/>\n94186565.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst we want to find whether it is divisible by 11, but on the way  <br/>\nwe are going to save the numbers that we use: in every step<br/>\n<br/>\nwe will subtract the last digit from the other digits, then save the  <br/>\nsubtracted amount in order. Start with<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n9418656 - 5=<br/>\n<br/>\n9418651<br/>\n<br/>\nSAVE 5<br/>\n<br/>\nThen<br/>\n<br/>\n941865 - 1 =<br/>\n<br/>\n941864<br/>\n<br/>\nSAVE 1<br/>\n<br/>\nThen<br/>\n<br/>\n94186 - 4 =<br/>\n<br/>\n94182<br/>\n<br/>\nSAVE 4<br/>\n<br/>\nThen<br/>\n<br/>\n9418 - 2 =<br/>\n<br/>\n9416<br/>\n<br/>\nSAVE 2<br/>\n<br/>\nThen<br/>\n<br/>\n941 - 6 =<br/>\n<br/>\n935<br/>\n<br/>\nSAVE 6<br/>\n<br/>\nThen<br/>\n<br/>\n93 - 5 =<br/>\n<br/>\n88<br/>\n<br/>\nSAVE 5<br/>\n<br/>\nThen<br/>\n<br/>\n8 - 8=<br/>\n<br/>\n1<br/>\n<br/>\nSAVE 8<br/>\n<br/>\nNow write the numbers we saved in reverse order, and we have 8562415,  <br/>\nwhich multiplied by 11 is 94186565.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an even easier method, contributed by Chis Foren:<br/>\n<br/>\nTake any number, such as 365167484.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd the 1,3,5,7,..,digits.....3 + 5 + 6 + 4 + 4 = 22<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd the 2,4,6,8,..,digits.....6 + 1 + 7 + 8 = 22<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the difference, including 0, is divisible by 11, then so is the  <br/>\nnumber.<br/>\n<br/>\n22 - 22 = 0 so 365167484 is evenly divisible by 11.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205204590,"authorName":"andre whetstone","from":"andre whetstone &lt;tuathadedans@...&gt;","profile":"tuathadedans","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Mutiplying 7s 8s and 9s","postDate":"1134587567","msgId":110707,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjE0MTkxMjQ3Ljg4NzgzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUwNDA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjE0MTg1NDI5LjI5NjYwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjgxMTAzLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":110706,"nextInTopic":110709,"prevInTime":110706,"nextInTime":110708,"topicId":110701,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"my kids sing the 7 s to the i love you you love me... barney song... 7, 14, 21 28 and 35 42,49,56,63 then at last ther s 70 for nines they read there hands..
