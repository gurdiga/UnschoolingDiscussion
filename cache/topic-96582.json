By this I mean, last year they just really didn&#39;t bring the &quot;big guy&quot; up.  <br/>\nWhen her youngest asked if Santa was coming she said something like, &quot;well, <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure, once we all grow up a little, he doesn&#39;t visit anymore, just like <br/>\nMama and Daddy don&#39;t get stuff from him.  We just give eachother things&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think she did this to &quot;test the water&quot; and see if the kids would dearly <br/>\nmiss him or if it would be understood and they&#39;d move on.  Well, they did move <br/>\non.  I was amazed and I&#39;m not sure why they weren&#39;t traumatized like I thought <br/>\nthey&#39;d be, but it worked.  Her youngest was 7 and oldest 11.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think mine would&#39;ve asked, &quot;well, how come they (the older kids) got <br/>\npresents from him last year and they were older than me and I don&#39;t get any now&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, she just tried that and they still made lists of things they&#39;d enjoy <br/>\nand the prospect of still getting a few goodies helped, I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if you were gonna go all out and say that there just isn&#39;t a Santa and <br/>\nthat all these years, the gifts have been from Mom and Dad or whoever, then I&#39;d <br/>\nsay just do it honestly.  Explain the &quot;tradition&quot; of it all and that it&#39;s just <br/>\nsomething people have done for a long time and it makes X-mas even more <br/>\nspecial than it is.  And that you just thought you&#39;d like to let them know that <br/>\nthey&#39;ll still have a wonderful holiday but you didn&#39;t want to have them hear it <br/>\nfrom someone else and have them be disappointed without an explanation.  It&#39;s a <br/>\ntradition and it may not last forever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI still get stuff labeled from Santa and in our family somebody always sends <br/>\nsomething but only labels it Santa and we never really find out who sent it.  <br/>\nAnd I&#39;m almost 33 :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then, they may just figure it out on their own, which I think mine will, <br/>\nat least Andrew (6.5) because he is a &quot;thinker&quot; and even last year he asked <br/>\nhow the elves can make all the toys there are and I said I guess he sends them <br/>\nout to shop, that I really didn&#39;t know.

Many of them<br/>\nare written in books, in movies.  My kids loved &quot;Shackleton&quot; and so did I<br/>\nsince I had read his personal account.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think even without movies and books, people have lots of adventures and<br/>\nquests.....some of us just have to try harder to see it.  Most people in<br/>\ntheir lives have at least a moment when they have to decide whether to stand<br/>\nup to evil or let it win.  Granted it probably doesn&#39;t look like a fire<br/>\nbreathing dragon to anyone but the person facing it down.   They have to<br/>\ndecide if they are willing to make sacrifices for a friend, they have to<br/>\nsearch out the truth for themselves.  I think this is no less magickal than<br/>\nattempting to return a ring to a mountain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I would point out to my son that most of the heroes in his stories<br/>\nare older than 6 and perhaps his adventures are waiting for him in the<br/>\nfuture, to keep an eye out for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:b229d655@...\">b229d655@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 20, 2004 6:36 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Where&#39;s the Magic?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 7/20/2004 6:51:32 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hoffmanwilson@...\">hoffmanwilson@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How about &quot;Me too!

Tell him about <br/>\nCatholic schools, with priests, monks and nuns as teachers.  Tell him about the <br/>\nearlier 19th C. one-room country schools, taught by single women, who would <br/>\nquit the job if they got married and other single women (or maybe men) would <br/>\ncome along for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to magic, maybe seek out tales in eye-witness to history books.  Pliny the <br/>\nElder telling about the eruption of Vesuvius long ago, that buried Pompeii <br/>\n(he was from another town nearby).  Then of people finding Pompeii so long <br/>\nafter.   The discoveries of some of the Egyptian tombs.  Of Sutton Hoo.   The Mary <br/>\nRose.   I think archeology is about as magical as it comes sometimes.  Though <br/>\nsome of it is drudgery for years, there are those moments of discovery where <br/>\nhistory just pours out.   In Kansas City there&#39;s the museum of a recovered <br/>\nwreck from the 19th century, a paddle boat with freight bound for general stores <br/>\nup the river sank, and the stuff (and part of the boat, and the history of the <br/>\nrecovery) are all there in the museum.  It&#39;s a wonderous bit of history.  <br/>\n&quot;Like a 19th Century Walmart,&quot; one of the narrations says. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the 1970&#39;s  (or early 80&#39;s?) a little boy in England found a medieval <br/>\nsword in a little stream.   &#39;70&#39;s too, someone walking in the desert near El Paso <br/>\nfound a long knife some Spanish explorer  dropped hundreds of years before.  <br/>\nIts in the museum in Albuquerque.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s an e-mail newsletter called Explorator with links once a week to the <br/>\nnewest discoveries around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother kind of magic is music.  We just watched Edward Scissorhands, and the <br/>\nscore is by Danny Elfman, and it&#39;s amazing, the texture and emotion he puts <br/>\nin there with that music.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523757,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"&quot;Pam Hartley&quot; &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","profile":"pdhartley2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Where&#39;s the Magic?","postDate":"1090377140","msgId":96595,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNka2tqaytnM2Y3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFkZi4yNWIwMjdhZi4yZTJlZDA5M0Bjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":96594,"nextInTopic":96600,"prevInTime":96594,"nextInTime":96596,"topicId":96582,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... mean, ahhhh,  I ... the Rings ... when we ... wish it were ...

You can go on to tell her more (Once you&#39;ve read a book or watched a movie, it&#39;s yours. Bend, tweak, revise, add on as you wish). Listen to stories she might tell. Draw pictures about it together (my daughter and I just drew a female character for her for Warriors of Might and Magic, she&#39;s been watching DH and I play it for days on the PS2). One of the best times babysitting I ever had was when I took the kids outside, everybody grabbed a stick (sword) and we bashed through the woods nearby for an hour or so in character on a fantasy adventure (This winter my kids and I spent time exploring the south pole in our backyard). Play related computer, gamesystem, roleplaying (these are like living the story, I don&#39;t know how kids grow up without them) and board games. Sew up some story related costumes for Barbies or stuffed animals. Make paper dolls. Sing songs. Visit websites. Build the world of the story with lego or wooden block (My daughter was constructed Might and Magic enviroments out of lego yesterday, soooo cool to watch). Simply be a character for awhile and play as you do your normal housework. Share any dreams or daydreams that were neat stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nI milk stories for everything I can and plan on sharing that with the kids. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn (who knows where the magic is.
