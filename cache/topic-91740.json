The situation is that we as a family had decided on a bedtime<br/>\n(which has always been flexable).  Hannah would then say after <br/>\ngetting in bed with me she was no longer tired.  So my husband would <br/>\ntake her and I would lay down with my older daughter.  Than after 10-<br/>\n15min would then say she wanted to go to bed.  We would then get back <br/>\nin bed and snuggle and then she after fussing a bit. Would state she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to sleep.  I would ask her if she wanted me to keep <br/>\nrubbing her head.  Then I would say ok I will take you into the other <br/>\nroom.  NO! she would scream and cry.  &quot;then you want to go to <br/>\nsleep?&quot;  NO! she would scream and cry again.  If it continued I would <br/>\nremove her from the room because it starts to bother my older <br/>\ndaughter. Then Hannah and I would sit on the couch and try to talk it <br/>\nout.  She would then confess Yes she was tired and was ready to go to <br/>\nsleep.  I would then bring her in and rub her head and within seconds <br/>\nshe will be asleep.  One issue was that we would go through this <br/>\nevery night. Even if She was the one comming to me wanting to go to <br/>\nbed.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me Harsh would be telling her in a demanding voice it is bedtime <br/>\nno matter what, and putting her in her room by herself.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Instead of seeing her as your adversary, and instead of being <br/>\n </span></blockquote>yours, can you <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; find a way to see yourself as her life partner (for this stage of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>her life, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; anyway) and see her pleasant moments as being dependent on you, and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>see her <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; bedtime as something you and she figure out together?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s not good for her health.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not good for her peace of mind.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not good for sleeping itself.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not good for her relationship with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>These are the reasons I came asking.  I shouldn&#39;t have used the word <br/>\nfighting.  I would try not to raise my voice.  It felt like a fight <br/>\nbecause we were going back and forth.  Bed-no bed. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; What is the purpose of sleeping?

Every group in my local area has the<br/>\n&gt; word &quot;Christian&quot; in their name, and many require a certain belief,<br/>\n&gt; etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3.  Unschooling.com local area boards:  I have emailed and left phone<br/>\n&gt; messages for a couple people through these, but one of the moms<br/>\n&gt; mentioned that &quot;we try to do reading, math and writing every day, but<br/>\n&gt; we unschool everything else.&quot;  After reading people on this list, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not ready to go there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It probably sounds like I&#39;m being too picky, but I am looking for<br/>\n&gt; someone like-minded that I can really share with, watch in their<br/>\n&gt; interactions, learn from and not feel embarrassed when I keep trying<br/>\n&gt; to help my sons get what they want, even when they are upset and<br/>\n&gt; crying.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance . . .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Peace,<br/>\n&gt; Amy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

When I felt my kids were old enough, I wanted to volunteer to help other mothers and look into becoming a lactation consultant. I ended up talking to one of my local LL leaders, who was so nice, patient and helpful. She invited me to the meeting, but I asked if I could bring my children since I homeschool. She told me that all 4 of the leaders homeschooled, so that was fine. I asked her what support group she was part of and I ended up meeting them a couple nights later for a Mom&#39;s Night Out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been a *great* bunch of women, and it turns out that 2 of the 4 LL leaders unschool as well.

Come to the conference �<br/>\nit can get you through the year in some ways. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe like Jayn to �run her part of the show� � because it really is still us,<br/>\nthe adults, allowing her to do so, so that she gets to make decisions. The<br/>\nonly time we have conflicts is really when I have slid into being<br/>\ncontrolling, all unaware, and am making arbitrary demands. Sometimes they<br/>\nare not arbitrary, but she doesn�t happen to agree with my reasoning.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother used to say things that were like a few drops of horrible poison<br/>\nabout my husband, that would then fester in my mind until I talked to him<br/>\nabout whatever it was. She recently had a stroke, and has changed a lot in<br/>\nthat her choice is to be happy and grateful, instead of judgmental all the<br/>\ntime. Also she is on medication that makes her loopy. However in the old<br/>\ndays I finally had to say to her �I never see anything wrong with him until<br/>\nyou point it out. Are you really trying make me to get a divorce?�. That<br/>\nslowed her down, as she really hadn�t realized that she wasn�t helping � her<br/>\nparadigm: the wife is supposed to remake the husband into a better man � I<br/>\ndon�t feel that is my job at all! Now she persists in giving me credit for<br/>\n�teaching� Jayn everything Jayn works out entirely for herself. Since it is<br/>\nhard to know how lucid Mum is at any time, I don�t try to set her straight<br/>\nevery time. She lives far away so her negative impact is now minimal.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L. Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;She keeps commenting that I am letting my girls &quot;run the show&quot;.  For <br/>\nthe most part I do not listen to her.  Part of me wanted to show her <br/>\nthat it wasn&#39;t true, instead of knowing that it is not true and <br/>\ncontinue on with our family unit.

I realized we have gotten away from <br/>\nthe way we parent here.  I no longer have my support system of other <br/>\nparents who attachment parent.  My mother has seeped into my brain.  <br/>\nShe keeps commenting that I am letting my girls &quot;run the show&quot;.  For <br/>\nthe most part I do not listen to her.  Part of me wanted to show her <br/>\nthat it wasn&#39;t true, instead of knowing that it is not true and <br/>\ncontinue on with our family unit.  The girls do have a lot of say.  <br/>\nAnd we have always tried to put their wellbeing and their needs <br/>\nfirst.  My oldest taught me that when she was a baby.  When she was a <br/>\nbaby we said good bye to her crib and got lots of comments for <br/>\nholding and tending to Emily too much.  I knew we were doing the <br/>\nright thing.  So I want to thank you for putting be back on track.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest(emily) had always been easy at bedtime.  When it was late <br/>\nwe read books to her and then I would lay down with her in our bed.  <br/>\nWe have been doing this since she was 6 months old.(she is 6yrs now)  <br/>\nWhen Hannah came along everything changed.  With Emily regressing <br/>\ninto her Autism and finding out she was autistic, I nursed hannah for <br/>\neverything including bed.  When we decided together that she was <br/>\ngoing to wean I still layed in bed with her and rubbed her head until <br/>\nshe fell asleep.  Recently she has decided that she isn&#39;t ready to <br/>\nsleep but she was trying to keep up her sister.  So my dh would take <br/>\nher into the livingrm and sit with her.  Then she would insist that <br/>\nshe was ready and would lay in her bed and then say that she wasn&#39;t <br/>\nready. <br/>\nNow I feel really bad for this month of crazy bedtime demands.  I let <br/>\nmy mother bother me.  I was hiding the fact that Hannah was still <br/>\nnursing past 3yrs.  She has never approved of my parenting or my <br/>\ndecision to homeschool, she was on me for a bit about hannah going to <br/>\npreschool.  Saying that Hannah needs to go to preschool so that she <br/>\nwould learn to respect adults, and learn how other kids her age <br/>\nshould be.( I didn&#39;t realize ~hOw~ bad that sounded until I just <br/>\nwrote it)<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you again for letting me take a good look at what was <br/>\nhappening.  I posted because that was not how I wanted to parent.  I <br/>\nDO NoT want her to cry every night over something like this. We do <br/>\nnot plan anything in the mornings anyhow because Emily(6) has a hard <br/>\ntime leaving too early for something.  I am surrounded by other moms <br/>\nwho put their kids in preschool in 3-5 days a week and take them to <br/>\nthis and that expecting too much.  We are always the last to leave <br/>\ntheir dance class because we are not rushing off.  I was starting to <br/>\ncatch myself rushing them for no reason. aaahhh.<br/>\n<br/>\n I feel very alone in my parenting.

She has always <br/>\ngone to bed with you in the past, nursing, snuggled against you, warm and safe. <br/>\nNow you want her to get into a cold bed without you, without that warmth... <br/>\nI&#39;m guessing as you nursed her you would rub her back, stroke her hair, kiss <br/>\nthe top of her head, say soft, loving words? Is there something in your life now <br/>\nwhere the whole family HAS to get up at a specific time? If not, why can&#39;t <br/>\nshe go to sleep later and wake later? Would doing that give you someone on one <br/>\ntime with your older daughter? I&#39;m not saying you should resume nursing or that <br/>\nyou were wrong to quit when you did, just that since you have left that part <br/>\nof her (and your) life behind why complicate it by taking the rest of it away <br/>\ntoo?<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of my kids stopped nursing around three, three and a half. Both my kids <br/>\nstill sleep with me and Darin whenever they want. If my kids are ready for bed <br/>\nand I&#39;m not they will get into my bed together and watch a movie. They have <br/>\ntheir own beds and bedrooms, and I would hazard a guess that they sleep in <br/>\ntheir own beds three nights a week. And Jack probably sleeps with his sister two <br/>\nand a half of those three nights. (so Moly is more ready for independent sleep <br/>\nthan he is at this point) If I&#39;m ready but they aren&#39;t, they may stay up and <br/>\nwatch TV in the living room or play a gamecube game. Sometimes I wake up to one <br/>\nor both sitting at the foot of my bed playing playstation2. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like going to bed by myself most of the time. I am used to a warm <br/>\nbody against me. Darin has been gone at school for three weeks now. (We go get <br/>\nhim tomorrow!!!)

We start the bedtime process around 11 now<br/>\nbecause we are all getting up earlier. My husband moved his office at home<br/>\nand we are trying to get on an earlier schedule because of that. Living in<br/>\nsouth FL, it&#39;a also easier to get moving earlier in the summer because of<br/>\nthe heat. So the bedtimes changed from 12 or 1 to 11. Wake up times went<br/>\nfrom noon to 9 or 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur children have always had their own rooms and beds from about the age of<br/>\n1. We never all slept in the same bed either. So moving beds or rooms and<br/>\nnot nursing could be the cause of some of her disagreement over bedtimes. My<br/>\n3 year old started that awhile ago. Staying up later for her would not make<br/>\nher sleep later the next day. A lot of kids seem to wake around the same<br/>\ntime no matter how late they go to bed. Then you have a grouchy kid. So her<br/>\nstaying up a lot later was not an option. I found that when the other 2 went<br/>\nto bed, just keeping Alyssa up after them was enough to satisfy her. About<br/>\n10 minutes after the other 2 were tucked in, I would ask if she wanted to go<br/>\nto bed because it was later and she would happily go. I guess she liked the<br/>\nidea of being the last child to go into the room. Sometimes it was 20<br/>\nminutes or so but never long enough to make her grouchy the next day. That<br/>\nlasted about a week and now she goes when her sister and brother does. It<br/>\nwas an easy solution.

I think she nursed a lot longer than her brother did because she needed the attention.  I found ways to give her the attention without the nursing.  I think she really needed the reassurance that I would be with her even if we weren&#39;t nursing.  One of the things we did was I would lay down with her until she fell asleep.  Now she is 9 and she has recently started wanting me to lay down with her at night.  I think she&#39;s needing the extra attention because I&#39;ve been busy with a couple of projects.  I stay with her at night until she tells me I can go.  I know I can say &quot;needs attention&quot; on this list and not have people think my daughter is greedy.  To me, providing attention is one of my critical functions as mother.   Hope this helps you some.

My kids usually go to bed between 9 and <br/>\n11, sometimes later.  They sleep fairly late too, past 9 most days, <br/>\nunless there is a reason to get up.  Occassionally they need to get up <br/>\nearly, so they do so, and then go to bed earlier that night to make up <br/>\nfor the sleep.  Other times they stay up later--I have many fond <br/>\nmemories of spending quiet hours watching a movie or just reading side <br/>\nby side with one or both of my children at 3 am.  Both my kids have <br/>\nalways been nightowls, and I usually am too, when I&#39;m not working. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t really see a need for a bedtime for unschooled kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nOccassionally we have times where it&#39;s obvious my kids aren&#39;t getting <br/>\nenough sleep.  We talk about it and find solutions and it all works <br/>\nout.  They are learning to listen to their body regarding sleep, not to <br/>\nwatch a clock.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any comments or advice welcome.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Deb S.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
