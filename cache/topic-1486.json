I have a question for anyone open to answer it...  In our <br/>\n&gt;homeschooling support group one of our contributions to the group is to plan <br/>\n&gt;an activity/field trip per semester.  I really want to plan one on the <br/>\n&gt;Holocaust for a variety of reason... I&#39;m sensing indifference from my 7 year <br/>\n&gt;old, at just the beginning of my research... this infuriates me... I&#39;m being <br/>\n&gt;unrealisitic  (kick me.. I know!  :-) But this is important to me and I <br/>\n&gt;believe she needs to know about this. Perhaps with further research it may <br/>\n&gt;pique (sp?  right word even?) her interest...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thoughts...?  Comments?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. :) IMHO, you (generic, not you personally) can do a lot of damage to a<br/>\nchild insisting that she know about something/learn about something<br/>\n(anything, even cheerful things) when she&#39;s not ready and interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy all means, delve into the holocaust yourself if you feel a need for it,<br/>\nbut recognize that it&#39;s *your* need and your project. If your daughter does<br/>\ncome to show interest now or in future, you can share what you&#39;ve learned.<br/>\nAnd you can certainly share your knowledge with any of the homeschooling<br/>\ngroup who&#39;d like to learn it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s extremely unlikely that she&#39;ll die of old age without learning about<br/>\nthe Holocaust. You&#39;re not trying to keep it from her. If she does get to be<br/>\nolder and hasn&#39;t a clue about it, you could ask her as a favor to you to sit<br/>\ndown and talk it over, that it&#39;s knowledge that *you* feel is extremely<br/>\nimportant and that you&#39;d like to share it with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe does not necessarily need to know about it today, tomorrow, next month,<br/>\nor by the time she&#39;s 11.75 years old. If she gains her knowledge at 11.85<br/>\nyears old, nothing terrible will come of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust out of curiousity, do you feel this way about other things (she *must*<br/>\nlearn to add and subtract this week or this month, she *must* learn some<br/>\nchemistry by next year, etc.) or is this just this particular subject? If it<br/>\nis *just* the Holocaust, it would be interesting (to me) to delve further<br/>\ninto my own mind and into *why* I thought it was so important that my 7 year<br/>\nold learn this right at this very time.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamhartley@...\">pamhartley@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"KSeebose@xxx.xxx","from":"KSeebose@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"MR-EymwWaa2syiFpXoIDiV6hr9CRLN9CT9ELKoYzhAyuR4giu0_Cym9V2BYHkQldVHcP4gtQiA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:  Re: Holocaust (was Parenting etc...)","postDate":"931802836","msgId":1488,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xMTMuMTQ4OC45NTkyNjk3NDBAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":1486,"nextInTopic":1489,"prevInTime":1487,"nextInTime":1489,"topicId":1486,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I certainly do not feel this is something that she needs to know right now... personally, I feel this is something that she *must* know about -- no excuses...","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-705799517\">I certainly do not feel this is something that she needs to know right now... <br/>\npersonally, I feel this is something that she *must* know about -- no <br/>\nexcuses...  but perhaps the suggestion that 7 is a very tender age to learn <br/>\nabout such hardships...
