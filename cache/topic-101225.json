I <br/>\nhave it available in a pdf file from the website listed  below.  Totally free.   <br/>\nThis book was originally a project for my family,  but I have since decided <br/>\nit would be fun to share with anyone  interested.  I consider it my <br/>\ncontribution to the homeschooling cause.  :)   <br/>\nIt has received a great response so far.  Ann Zeise  of A to Z Home&#39;s Cool <br/>\nand Beverly Hernandez of About.com have  put links on their sites and so far two <br/>\nmagazines have contacted me  for permission to publish an excerpt.   <br/>\nI hope you are intrigued enough to go check it out for  yourself and if you <br/>\nlike it, to pass it on to your list members.   <br/>\n_http://www.timeforbedlam.com_ (http://www.timeforbedlam.com/)  <br/>\nThank you so much for taking time to consider whether to  pass this offer on <br/>\nto your list members. <br/>\nIf you have any questions, feel free to email  me. <br/>\nSincerely, <br/>\nDebbie  Harbeson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101128,"nextTopicId":101190}}
