I don&#39;t have to work for financial reasons but for my own mental health.  I need the feeling of independence.  I have three small businesses right now.  I sell used books on Amazon, I am just starting to teach music to young children, and I trade stocks.  My daughter comes with every trip I make to the post office to mail books, she listens to me prepare for music class, she hangs out while I work on the computer and read my financial publications.  I have arranged to swap partial tuition for a music class in exchange for the mom to watch Katrina during it.  I have tentative plans to do at least one more swap of tuition for child care and teach on the weekends so my husband can take care of her.  Longer term, I will be looking for late-afternoon care for her so I can teach more classes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest looking at the following books for work-at-home suggestions.  Look at them in the bookstore, check them out from the library.  They are books to browse<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Stay-At-Home Mom&#39;s Guide to Making Money from Home by Liz Folger<br/>\nThe Entrepreneurial Parent by Paul and Sarah Edwards and Lisa Roberts<br/>\n101 Best Home-Based Businesses for Women by Priscilla Y. Huff<br/>\n<br/>\nI teach music and sell books and trade stocks because that&#39;s where my expertise is and I enjoy it.  I&#39;m working about 10 hours a week on the stock picking.  The income from that can be very good but it&#39;s rather erratic.  I spend about three hours a week selling books but could easily be more.  Teaching music is depends on how many classes.  It&#39;s about two hours/week of preparation time for teaching one class.  There is also about one hour/week of general business stuff.  I have a lot bigger time commitment now because I&#39;m just starting so there is lots of initial stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think it&#39;s good for my daugher to see me working.  I come from a long line of entrepreneurs and so does my husband so it seems natural to me to be working and taking care of my daughter.  As she gets older, I will have her work in the business.  She&#39;s already likes to help with packaging the books for shipment.  (Well she can&#39;t really help yet but she likes to pretend.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda Siemsen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Tim and Maureen <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, June 17, 2003 6:42 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] jobs and unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have 4 kids 15,13, 11, and 7. We have trouble making ends meet without me working as the kids have allergies and health issues that require a fair amount of funds.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My dilemma is that I worry about not being there enough for my kids. So far I am working 20-30 hours per week and looking after my 3 year old nephew during the days. I have been working in the evenings every night and 6 hours on Sundays, occasionally Sat.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I hate the feeling I have when I am away from my kids. My 11 yr old still dislikes it as well as the 7 yr old.Fortunately they are at home with my dh in the evenings but still they are sad when I have to go to work. It really looks like working has to be part of our reality at this point and I hate that so I struggle with the idea that maybe I am doing them a disservice by them having a mom that isn&#39;t home enough.Sometimes I wonder if they would be better off at school although as I write this I realise how silly this is because their questions, needs, etc.. wouldn&#39;t be met anymore there.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My kids are big homebodies. They are all highly sensitive and do not socialise with the neighbours at all. They have a small group of friends and I think this bothers me more than them. I am having trouble shaking this feeling of maybe I am not doing enough. Anybody have any experience with situations similar to this.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maureen Thomas<br/>\n<br/>\n  PS I am an extrovert and am living with all introverted, highly sensitive individuals.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

In <br/>\nour state, they have something called &quot;CHIPS&quot; (children&#39;s health insurance <br/>\nprescription &quot;something or other&quot;) and many different levels of it depending on a <br/>\nperson&#39;s income.  Some which are basically free, others with a small co-pay.  <br/>\nThe amount of income a person can earn and still be eligible is very generous, <br/>\nand they take into consideration how many children you have.  Check with your <br/>\nstate&#39;s department of health and human resources.

It sucks to have the stress of having to work outside the home when that is really not what anyone in your family wants.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d have to say that I don&#39;t think the kids would be better off in school than being with their parents, though.  Unless, perhaps, it was a free school (as in freedom, not as in you don&#39;t have to pay for it), they wanted to be there and you were able to get all your working in while they were there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been all over this situation, but have you brainstormed about other ways of working out the finances?  Anything from major scaling back to opening your home to a foster child (which you get paid for).  I&#39;m not coming up with anything else off the top of my head, but perhaps, if this is help that you&#39;d be interested in, others on the list can come up with some ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you come to a resolution that works for you and yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nNicholina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] jobs and unschooling","postDate":"1055891654","msgId":74676,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyZDUwMWMzMzUyYSQzZWRhNTM2MCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwNDgwMWMzMzUyMSRhY2RmMTVjMCQxODU1NDUxOEBjYS5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":74671,"nextInTopic":74683,"prevInTime":74675,"nextInTime":74677,"topicId":74671,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... dislikes it as well as the 7 yr old.Fortunately they are at home with my dh in the evenings but still they are sad when I have to go to work.
