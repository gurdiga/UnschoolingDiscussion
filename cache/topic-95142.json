This is the biggest issue with my daughter. She <br/>\ngets hypoglycemic, cranky beyond belief, but there are virtually no <br/>\nproteins she will eat and definitely none once she gets to the cranky <br/>\nphase. We were at a friend&#39;s house for a BBQ last night, and I packed <br/>\nalong chicken for the BBQ, veggie burgers (both of my kids go back <br/>\nand forth on whether they want to eat meat or not), a bag of almonds, <br/>\nand a peanut butter sandwich. None of them were a go for her. We&#39;ve <br/>\nsat down together and tried to come up with a list of proteins that <br/>\nshe would be okay with eating. She&#39;ll say a few things, but when the <br/>\ntime comes and I suggest protein, she doesn&#39;t want to eat any of <br/>\nthem. If she eats more carbs or sugar, we&#39;re back into the crabby <br/>\ncycle. She did eat one peanut butter sandwich this week (a first!). I <br/>\ncan very occasionally get her to eat eggs if I cook them flat in a <br/>\npan and give her cookie cutters to cut them into shapes, but mostly <br/>\nshe plays with them and leaves them on the plate. <br/>\n<br/>\nNone of this is an issue with my son, who is most easy-going about <br/>\nfood and eats a pretty healthy balanced diet all on his own. If I <br/>\nsuggest he eat some protein or get a snack because he&#39;s starting to <br/>\nget that cranky/hungry thing, he&#39;ll go right ahead and get something <br/>\nor ask me to fix him something. Ironically, this is the kid whose <br/>\ndiet was completely and totally controlled due to multiple, severe, <br/>\nfood allergies when he was younger (no longer an issue though), and <br/>\nhe&#39;s the easy-going one about food.

He can&#39;t eat just a few cookies.  He eats the whole pack.  If we don&#39;t have any sweet goodies at the moment, he will eat sugar directly out of the canister.  This is a problem for two reasons.  1) No one in the house will get any sweet snacks, if he is allowed to eat all he wants.  2) He will choose to go without food and just eat sweets if allowed.  Our house always has fresh vegetables and other healthy natural foods, because we have parrots.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t go overboard on the nutrition thing.  We have a lot of knowledge and discussions because of the parrots.  We have often mentioned when we are having McDonalds that we would NEVER allow the parrots to eat such unhealthy food.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe agrees that he feels better when he limits his sugar.  I agree that I feel better when I&#39;m not carrying extra weight.  That doesn&#39;t make it easy.  Because he is a growing boy and his body needs nutrients to grow, we worry about his sugar intake, and lack of proper nutrition.  He is not overweight, so that isn&#39;t a factor. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow would an unschooler handle this?<br/>\nMargie<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95476,"nextTopicId":95380}}
