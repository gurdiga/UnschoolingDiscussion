My son has an entire world of &quot;Ojos&quot;, his <br/>\nname for his group of Lego people. Each Lego person has his own <br/>\nspecific attributes, personality, job in the &quot;Ojo&quot; world, etc. and <br/>\nthey are so important to him that when other kids come over, he asks <br/>\nme to put them up. A couple of times, kids who didn&#39;t understand his <br/>\nuniverse did things like switched heads and bodies of the Ojos <br/>\naround. Perfectly normal thing to do, but to him it was like they&#39;d <br/>\njust decapitated his best friends, he was horrified. It took us <br/>\ntwo hours to get all the little people sorted out and back to normal. <br/>\nSo I can imagine that if the toy fairy just disappeared them all, he <br/>\nwould 1) Never want to see or hear about another fairy in his life, <br/>\ngood or bad, 2) Never trust me again, let alone probably another <br/>\nhuman being, and 3) Grieve as if those little people were really dead <br/>\n(which to him, they would be).

I also nursed when i pleased he was 3 then, nursed til 5, of course they thought of me as some sort of waldorf rebel. I do however like the natural toys approach, play with things of the earth, but that could be of my native american approach too. So in point we should, i feel, do whatever feels right......both to us and our children. We are not perfect and I do not believe there is ONE way to parent.........JUST BE WHO WE ARE AND WHAT FEELS RIGHT, hopefully it will turn out well. We do our best.  By the way I have many Waldorf books to sell, lol, if anyone is interested. Last but not least I feel we can pull many philosophies together as I have done, learn something from everyone, that has helped me alot over the years. But listening to our instincts is really important therefore knowing where to draw then line as I have read many of you have done well when it came to the Waldorf approach.
