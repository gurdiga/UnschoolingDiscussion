It was a chance for <br/>\nchildren around the age of four to interact with others, usually two or three <br/>\nhours a day, two or three days a week. Now children are sent to preschool <br/>\nstarting as young as two all day long, all week long. Then when they are <br/>\nabout four or so they go to pre-k. Many schools in our district have added <br/>\npre-k programs and the idea of adding pre-k as an actual grade to go through, <br/>\nis being tossed around. I am astounded at all this so called *need for <br/>\nchildren to have every chance at success in school* that has yanked them all <br/>\nstraight from the breast right into four brick walls and a view of the <br/>\nteachers parking lot. <br/>\nWhen I went to Oklahoma last week, I went with my sister to pick up her <br/>\ndaughter (2) from preschool. I stood at the door while she got my niece ready <br/>\nto go and looked across the hall at the pre-k room. The teacher was trying to <br/>\nhave a lesson, she had a plate with plastic food on it. A hamburger, corn on <br/>\nthe cob and some other things like milk and juice. She asked the circle of <br/>\nfaces sitting before her where did all this food come from. The kid I liked <br/>\nbest said it was plastic not food and it came from the toy shelf. Of course <br/>\nhe was gently reprimanded and the question repeated. A little girl said you <br/>\nget food from the grocery store, which caused an argument over which was a <br/>\nbetter place to shop, Super-Wal-mart, Super-Target or some other store. Then <br/>\nthe teacher asked where the food came from before it was in the store. <br/>\nAnother little boy said his uncle brought the food in his truck, so the <br/>\nteacher asked how it got on his truck to which the little guy said &quot;They <br/>\nloaded it up at the warehouse&quot; The teacher still had a sweet smile on her <br/>\nface, but you could tell she was frustrated. By the time they got to the idea <br/>\nthat hamburger and milk come from cows, and corn is grown in a field, and <br/>\nwhat cows are was all explained the idea was lost on the kids. Some were <br/>\npicking their noses, some were picking on each other, one was looking out the <br/>\nwindow, and my sister says to me wasn&#39;t that lesson a good idea? Aren&#39;t those <br/>\nkids lucky to have learned all that? I told her the kids were bored, didn&#39;t <br/>\ncare, and too young for those lessons anyway. She said they wouldn&#39;t have the <br/>\nopportunity to learn about this elsewhere, it was the best thing they were in <br/>\npreschool so they wouldn&#39;t be behind in kindergarten. We got into a <br/>\ndiscussion about all this and it didn&#39;t go well. My sister finally ended it <br/>\nby making a statement to me that just shocked me. She said &quot;Public school was <br/>\ngood enough for me, it will be good enough for Isabelle.&quot;  That was when I <br/>\nrealized where this attitude about how children should learn and be raised <br/>\ncomes from.

They have created a playgroup and some are teaching their children letters etc. (a playgroup I didnot join because my son doesn&#39;t like group situations - I even worry if that is OK). But after the short time I have been on this list I have become more relaxed and not worrying so much. You will laugh when I tell you the children are about 4yrs of age - but today I looked at my two children - 4 in Oct and 2 in Sept and I thought - why the hell am I worrying - these years should be all about play not concerned whether or not if they can count or know their letters - unbelievable - even amongst homeschoolers you can get caught up in the pressure for your young children to learn. I was worried that I was too lazy to teach now I am beginning to realise that I was getting caught up with &quot;The Hurried Child Syndrome&quot;. So just a thanks to the list for help bringing me to my senses. The pressure is off.<br/>\n<br/>\nSue from Australia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38920,"nextTopicId":38960}}
