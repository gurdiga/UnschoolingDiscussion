I just started reading Learning all the<br/>\nTime and what an amzing book!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI usually only have time to read when I&#39;m riding my bike in the<br/>\nmornings (stationary bike).  I ride for an hour a day and that&#39;s when<br/>\nI get caught up on my reading.  I&#39;m usually so tired when I get done<br/>\nthat I just want it to be over.  Well, this morning, I started reading<br/>\nLearning all the Time and, before I knew it, 75 minutes had gone by! <br/>\nI couldn&#39;t believe how much I related to this book. I grew up in<br/>\npublic schools and, everything that he said about the &quot;learning&quot; that<br/>\ngoes on in them is true.  I never really learned anything.  I would<br/>\nmemorize it for the test and then quickly forget everything that I had<br/>\n&quot;learned.&quot;  The only thing that I have retained from school is only<br/>\nthose things which I really wanted to know about and went so far as to<br/>\nreseach on my own time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe things that he points out about how children are taught to read in<br/>\nthe public schools and how absurd some of the phonics &quot;rules&quot; are, are<br/>\nso true.  I remember, when I was learning to read, how they just<br/>\ndidn&#39;t make any sense.  And the same with math &quot;rules.&quot;  I remember<br/>\nasking a teacher once (in my highschool trig class) &quot;but why is that?&quot;<br/>\n He just looked at me and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know, it just is.&quot;  Gee that<br/>\nreally helped me to figure it out.  :)  I never asked that question<br/>\nagain. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I am now even more excited about unschooling than I was<br/>\nbefore.  I can&#39;t wait to watch my daughter learn on her own (with help<br/>\nfrom me, if asked) those things that I struggled with as a child in<br/>\nthe public school system.  I can&#39;t wait to give this book to my<br/>\nhusband to read, maybe he&#39;ll now understand what I mean when I say<br/>\n&quot;unschooling.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73691,"nextTopicId":73714}}
