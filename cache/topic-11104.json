When I was in college I gave up meat for a year, <br/>\nor tried to -- I found I just had to have a hamburger or steak about once a <br/>\nmonth! Similarly when I was pregnant I had a real longing for eggs! I guess <br/>\nI just needed that extra protein. The Bradley books I read said many <br/>\npregnant women don&#39;t get enough.
