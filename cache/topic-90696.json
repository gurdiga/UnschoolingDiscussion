I get mail order catelogues, book club brochures, craft supply<br/>\nmail order stuff,  I clean out closets or cabinets.  I look through all that<br/>\nand sometimes I find things that I&#39;m interested in.  New hobbies, stuff I<br/>\nwant to read, that sort of thing.  But my kids aren&#39;t exposed to as much<br/>\nstuff as I am.  All that stuff that comes in the mail comes addressed to me<br/>\nor their Dad, and they don&#39;t want to plow through it!  And they don&#39;t enjoy<br/>\nwandering around stores to see what&#39;s new.  So I do that for them, just like<br/>\nI do a lot of other things that they either don&#39;t enjoy or aren&#39;t able to<br/>\ndo.  Since I am exposed to things that they aren&#39;t, it&#39;s my job to let them<br/>\nknow what I&#39;ve gleaned from it that might be useful/interesting to them.<br/>\nStrewing is how I let them know what&#39;s out there.<br/>\n    This applies especially to my daughter.  She 9 and she&#39;s an artist.  You<br/>\nnever know what materials might be inspirational or exactly the right thing<br/>\nfor what she&#39;s working on.  How much is she going to run into as opposed to<br/>\nwhat I am exposed to?  And besides, she&#39;s busy!  She doesn&#39;t have time to go<br/>\nthrough all those books that are absolutely of no interest to her just so<br/>\nshe&#39;ll find that one book on sewing felt!  But if that one book that&#39;s a<br/>\ntreasure is just sitting on her crafts table, I&#39;ve done something really<br/>\nnice for her.    If I just hand her something she acts like she has to<br/>\nimmediately decide if it&#39;s useful to her or not.  If  the book is just<br/>\nsitting there, it separates my feelings from whether the book or craft<br/>\nmaterial is actually interesting/useful.  She can look it over without<br/>\nhaving to take my feelings and possible motives into account.<br/>\n    Seeing a really cool book or video on old cars at the library in a<br/>\nsection my son doesn&#39;t usually walk through, and then not showing it to him<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be a nice thing to do!   Maybe he&#39;s so interested in DragonBall Z<br/>\nright now that he doesn&#39;t care about old cars anymore, but how do you know<br/>\nif you don&#39;t put it out there for him?    If that book is just sitting<br/>\naround, it would give him something to do when he needs a break from the<br/>\nother stuff he&#39;s working so hard on.<br/>\n    Everyone in my family reads.  If we are eating alone, and there&#39;s<br/>\nnothing to read, we read the cereal box.  I think I&#39;m doing them a favor<br/>\nputting something out that&#39;s more interesting than the cereal box.   I don&#39;t<br/>\nsee this as interfering or controlling.  I think I&#39;m being helpful and<br/>\ninterested in my kids.<br/>\n        Deirdre in Alabama</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90740,"nextTopicId":90780}}
