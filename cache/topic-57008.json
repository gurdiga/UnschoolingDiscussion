Once my <br/>\nkids have their minds set on something, there&#39;s really no changing it, at <br/>\nleast for most of the time.  They have always been very decisive, <br/>\nindependent, and never afraid to tell people what they think or feel, kind of <br/>\nkids.  Right now there&#39;s really no talking them into something.  If they have <br/>\ntheir minds set on watching tv, that&#39;s what they&#39;ll do.

Although they watch a lot of tv, during the other many hours they <br/>\nare up, they do a lot of things.  I&#39;m quite sure I am worrying for nothing.  <br/>\nYesterday they only watched about 3 hours of tv.  One thing I noticed is that <br/>\nthey don&#39;t seem to be as creative, curious and physically active as they used <br/>\nto be.  I&#39;m going to see if I can help them with that.  I know when I watch a <br/>\nlot of tv, I get tired, lazy, and have no desire to do much of anything.  I&#39;m <br/>\nnot going to force or argue with them about watching tv, but I&#39;ll see if I <br/>\ncan excite them, get them out of the house more,  and get them interested in <br/>\nsomething, like an indoor garden.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur new thing is some colored &quot;peanuts&quot; like used to be styrofoam packing <br/>\nmaterial, but now are sometimes made of corn starch, which dissolves in water.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter used to play with that a lot.

I used to watch with them, but I can&#39;t get myself <br/>\n&gt; to do it anymore.  This has been going on since September.  I know all the <br/>\n&gt; songs, all the characters and stories.  I realize that they&#39;re up for 14 <br/>\n&gt; hours per day so 6 or more hours doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not doing something <br/>\n&gt; else, but it&#39;s hard to watch them.

My daughter says, <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Maybe after we watch Monsters, Inc&quot;.  It usually doesn&#39;t end with one.  A <br/>\n&gt; big part of me wants to unplug the tv and say it&#39;s not working, but I would <br/>\n&gt; never do that.  We do try to go to gymnastics on Wednesday.  We&#39;ve missed a <br/>\n&gt; lot, which is very hard for me because it costs a lot of money.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lately, I&#39;ve been coming to this board to see what people have to say about <br/>\n&gt; their family&#39;s lifestyle.  I feel like I need to try something new.  Maybe <br/>\n&gt; give them a choice of watching one movie and then doing something else, or <br/>\n&gt; doing something first and then watching one movie.
