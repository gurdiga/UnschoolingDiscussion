I am so sorry about the loss of your son. You are <br/>\nso right, our son does not deserve my energy being spent on feeling guilty. <br/>\nIt&#39;s hard as you very well know to get past these issues. You&#39;ve really made <br/>\nme look at things a bit more differently by sharing your story. We came very <br/>\nclose to loosing our son in an accident. I am very grateful that he is here <br/>\nwith us today. That is what I should be focussed on....today. Yes, I have <br/>\ntold our son everything that I feel and how sorry I am. He tells me that it <br/>\nis okay because no one is perfect and we all make mistakes. Thank-you Joanna, <br/>\nyou don&#39;t know how much your story has opened my eyes. I need to move forward.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Have you told your ds all of this?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that helps.  My older two got the brunt of my ignorance.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey were 7 and 4 before I started coming around and learning about <br/>\n<br/>\nrespectful parenting.  I told my son Sam last year that I wanted to <br/>\n<br/>\napologize for being not so nice to him, as a toddler, some of the <br/>\n<br/>\ntime. (forced naps, time outs, hurting him with a spank or grab of <br/>\n<br/>\nthe arm...all kinds of miserable things).  I needed to tell him <br/>\n<br/>\nbecause I had been worse to him than my dd, who didn&#39;t push my <br/>\n<br/>\nbuttons quite as much.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSam and I were both stubborn and butted heads quite often.  We still <br/>\n<br/>\nargued and didn&#39;t see eye to eye quite a bit, but we had come a long <br/>\n<br/>\nway towards respecting each other and I was really starting to feel <br/>\n<br/>\ngood about the progress I had made in being more patient and <br/>\n<br/>\nrespectful of him.  He died on Jan. 19 of this year.  He fell through <br/>\n<br/>\nthe ice on a lagoon at a park while there with another family. One of <br/>\n<br/>\nthe things that helps me cope, is remebering how much I strived to <br/>\n<br/>\nmake our relationship better and how I knew, he knew how much I love <br/>\n<br/>\nhim, because of it.  I also feel very fortunate to have found <br/>\n<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSam was 8 (almost 9), and he spent his day finding his joy.  No time <br/>\n<br/>\nwasted in school all day.  No time wasted doing meaningless <br/>\n<br/>\nworksheets to make me feel better.  Infact, not having to think about <br/>\n<br/>\nschooling him gave us all the more time to work on being together <br/>\n<br/>\npeacefully.  Everyone who knew him described him as joyful.  He <br/>\n<br/>\nrelished life (sometimes with more energy than I could handle).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll always regret the times I could have been a WAY better mom with <br/>\n<br/>\nhim, but I try to avoid remorse because I know I saw the error of my <br/>\n<br/>\nways and strived to do better.  That&#39;s all we can ask of ourselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEnergy spent feeling guilty is not going to help you to be the best <br/>\n<br/>\nof you.  Your son deserves that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know my kids do.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna&gt;&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68536,"nextTopicId":68444}}
