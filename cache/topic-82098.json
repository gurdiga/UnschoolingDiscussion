But sometimes we can&#39;t find what we are looking for unless<br/>\nsome one tells us where we have missed the trail, where we went from &quot;warm&quot;<br/>\nto &quot;cold&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n5 years ago, I took my oldest out of first grade and started reading the<br/>\ninternet trying to find out anything about homeschooling.  I went to the AOL<br/>\nhomeschooling boards and ran into Sandra.  I&#39;m sure she doesn&#39;t remember but<br/>\nI most certainly do.  I have rarely been that angry with another adult.  And<br/>\nI have said it many times on various boards that I owe Sandra a lot.  She<br/>\nsaved my kids from many years of meanness because she called them like she<br/>\nsaw them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a &quot;nice&quot; mom, the one who listens to her kids, who plays with her kids,<br/>\nwho tries not to overly coerse her kids.  But I wasn&#39;t unschooling, I wasn&#39;t<br/>\ntrusting.  I see it now because I have moved to that level of comfort that I<br/>\nknow the kids are doing great in their own unique ways and I don&#39;t have to<br/>\nmeasure them against themselves, other kids or society&#39;s standards.  I just<br/>\nlove them and am awestruck by them.  But I didn&#39;t see it then.  I was just<br/>\nangry and defensive.  It took awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it feels personal now.  Just breathe easy.  Take it in and let it<br/>\nferment and distill in your heart and life.  Just like wine, you will see<br/>\nthe sediment start to sink to the bottom of your existence and you can just<br/>\nbottle up the good stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82097,"nextTopicId":82085}}
