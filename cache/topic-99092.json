That seems to be enough (most of the time).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my stepping in was actually on his behave.  I&#39;ve noticed that some adults don&#39;t realize they can be direct and honest with kids and need help.  (Schooled or manipulated/coerced kids also sometimes need help in expressing their feelings directly and honestly).  So in the case where adult David was being teased by child and i sensed his discomfort, i asked him directly in front of Fire if he would prefer not to be called whatever name he was being called.  He stopped play acting and replied to me &quot;yes, I don&#39;t like that.&quot;  I don&#39;t recall whispering anything specific to Fire at the time other than perhaps being sure that she was aware of his request.  I hadn&#39;t realized he didn&#39;t hear what i said to her.  I generally don&#39;t initiate whispering to my children (or anyone for that matter) in front of other people.  Once she was aware of his truth, that seemed to be enough for her to change her behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99085,"nextTopicId":99121}}
