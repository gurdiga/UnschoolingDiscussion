But then I <br/>\nthink about what if I met the President. I mean once any one reaches the <br/>\nstatus of being an United States President, that rank and title stay forever. Yet <br/>\nthen I pause because I wonder if I truly had access to such a person, would my <br/>\npersonal biases or distain for particular Presidents change my feeling about <br/>\ntheir rank or title? I will definately think on this portion harder. Does rank <br/>\nand title necessarily make one deserved of good manners. i.e. If I were to <br/>\nmeet Sadam Hussein, the president of Iraq, who I&#39;m pretty sure thinks of himself <br/>\nas ranking and worthy of said title, would I be polite or use proper <br/>\netiquette, simply because he holds such? Or would my disdain for the individual <br/>\noverride the general politeness during introductions.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; If not, how you decide how to manage introductions?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So at this point having not contemplated further, I can only explain that <br/>\nthus far I have managed intros by simply doing them, not basing them on who holds <br/>\na higher social status than another. If I know both parties, yet they do not <br/>\nknow each other, I would probably choose whoever I knew more as the one to <br/>\nintroduce first, but not exclusively. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;But is this rank <br/>\n&gt; thing an everyday issue or more to do with SCA, where I would fully imagine <br/>\n&gt; it to be of importance?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; SCA probably helps them be more aware, but there is real rank.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>But who is responsible for declaring such rank and who must follow suit or is <br/>\nthere one?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour CEO gave you access.  You couldn&#39;t have taken it without his &gt; <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; cooperation.  It was his option, because he ranked.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OMG I finally found a statement to disagree with Sandra Dodd on. LOL No ever <br/>\ngave me access, I took it as I usually do, if such thing exists.  From day <br/>\none, company policy was everyone was addressed by first name, regardless of <br/>\ntitle. Lucky for me cuz I probably never would taken the job otherwise. But for <br/>\nsome reason when it came to the CEO & CIO, everyone called them Mr. Surname. Well <br/>\nthat just wasn&#39;t my thing, so I called them by their first names just as they <br/>\nwould call me by mine. Had they preferred to be called by their surnames, <br/>\nseveral things would have to follow. First, I&#39;d expect to be referred to as Mrs. <br/>\nHill, not Rhonda and secondly I&#39;d expect company policy to change also, in <br/>\nwriting so that such an infraction would have to be written down somewhere for <br/>\nany cause of action to take place. Lastly, I would want clear definitions of <br/>\nwhat ranks them worthy of change in dialogue venue. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps, for me, that has to do with something more on a soul/spiritual <br/>\nlevel. For in my view, money never makes one human more worthy of my kindness than <br/>\nanother. I know this is in general the &quot;American Way&quot;, just not how it works <br/>\nfor me.
