I believed that his <br/>\nwill/desire/curiosity/need<br/>\nwas just too strong to explore/try regardless if it pleased his parents or <br/>\nnot.  Such a<br/>\ntough time, I often felt that he just didn&#39;t want to be a part of our family, <br/>\nhe just<br/>\nwould not fit in or cooperate at all.

One<br/>\nthing that has helped me so much are a series of books by the Giselle <br/>\nInstitute,<br/>\nYour one year old, your two year old and so on.  what they talk about is how <br/>\nchildren go in and out of equilibrium every six months or so.  For my other <br/>\ntwo<br/>\nchildren I didn&#39;t notice it very strongly, but for my middle boy it was sooooo<br/>\nobvious that other family members noticed the change (that would be when<br/>\nhe &quot;bounced&quot; back &quot;into&quot; equilibrium--his behavior/personality becomes much<br/>\nmore positive)  This so far has been most noticeable turning three and <br/>\nturning <br/>\nfour.  So for the first half of the year everything appeared normal, then <br/>\nlate into<br/>\nthe second half of the year I would go, oh wow look at this, he is way out of<br/>\nof control.  He is now 5 1/2, haven&#39;t noticed any changes yet....but its <br/>\nstill to<br/>\nearly to tell LOL.  Oh and the other part of the books are that they talk <br/>\nabout<br/>\nage appropriate behavior.  I know that when I know behaviors are normal I<br/>\ncan deal with them so much better.  Oh and about the pajama top, when he<br/>\nbounced back into equilibrium months later, he came to me and most sincerely<br/>\nsaid, mom I am sorry I cut your top.  It was so sweet.  I would have thought<br/>\nhe had forgotten it.

How <br/>\nto deal with it?  I don&#39;t have any good answers.  When my oldest was this <br/>\nage, he did similar things.  He still remembers taking a canning jar out on <br/>\nthe front porch, holding over the corner of the cement and dropping it with <br/>\nsome force simply to see if it would shatter!  He saw it on TV and wanted to <br/>\nknow if it would really break.  Of course, at that time he wasn&#39;t able to <br/>\ntell me WHY he&#39;d done such a thing and we laugh about it now.  He also <br/>\nremembers being grounded from TV for that act.  His favorite show at the time <br/>\nwas Dukes of Hazard and the season finale was that week.  So, DS sat outside <br/>\nand watched it in the reflection of the window!!  This is even more <br/>\nremarkable since I don&#39;t like the show, so he had get it on at the right time <br/>\nwithout drawing my attention to the fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the same son that pushed us to an unschooling lifestyle...he simply <br/>\nwill NOT be put in a box.  He pulled out numerous music tapes (pre-VCR days), <br/>\ncolored on the walls over and over again even though we had paper available <br/>\nand he got in trouble every time!  (also pre-washable markers)<br/>\n<br/>\nHate to admit it, but we never found a good solution in channeling his <br/>\nbehavior.  I did have to learn to disengage and not take it personally or the <br/>\nkid would NOT have made it to adulthood.  The standard line became something <br/>\nlike &quot;How old do you want to be when you die?  You&#39;re not even gonna make it <br/>\nto your next birthday at this rate!&quot;  (said very tongue in cheek so he <br/>\nrecognized he wasn&#39;t in real danger and I could find some humor)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is still strong willed as an adult and, lucky him, so is his wife and <br/>\ntoddler!  LOL  What goes around comes around.  heheheh  And I never even had <br/>\nto curse him with the wish that he&#39;d someday have a child just like himself.  <br/>\n&lt;beg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully someone will have some answers that will help.
