I have no<br/>\nproblems with anyone elses faith or convictions.  What I do have problems<br/>\nis with the way some try to force their beliefs down the throats of others<br/>\nand by doing so they devalue the beliefs of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone&#39;s own beliefs are very important and very personal and should not<br/>\nbe belittled by others.  I know many fine Chrisitians and like their<br/>\ncompany, they are able to accept that I do not believe what they do and<br/>\njust get on with our relationship, whatever that may be.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW I suffered at the hands of more than one person, for some strange<br/>\nreason working in a children&#39;s home seems to dehumanize people, or maybe it<br/>\nattracts the type of people who feel powerless in their own lives and<br/>\nrealize that when in control of a group of orphans, unwanted children etc<br/>\nthey are all powerfull.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;m mostly over it now, it took me over 30 years before I could<br/>\ntalk about it, and only then could the healing really start to take effect.<br/>\n In some ways I do think a difficult childhood can lead to increased<br/>\ncompassion for others, but I think it more often goes the other way and<br/>\nproduces people who pass the suffering on to their own children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-  Sue   -<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Winona Farm in Minnesota Welcomes Unschoolers All Year Round<br/>\nMy website:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e\">http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e</a><br/>\nFarm website:    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/\">http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/</a><br/>\nFarm newsletter: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm</a><br/>\nMailing list:    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Unschooling_MN_WI_IA\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Unschooling_MN_WI_IA</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To believe in something, and not to live it, is to be dishonest.&quot;<br/>\n-Mahatma Gandhi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"deejay@ithink.com","from":"deejay@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ovZacPfIwecVMIiNmnxTL-AcvzR6hAanxdFcED_SaqTD-F36ahyPwbkdeRcg2UKs7IFFaaySSik","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re; Great Idea","postDate":"950587359","msgId":6492,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40MTkuNjQ5Mi45NTkyNjk3NDZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6520,"prevInTime":6491,"nextInTime":6493,"topicId":6492,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sue, When I read your post, my heart broke and tears welled up into my eyes.

I cannot even begin to comprehend the agony of what you have been through.  I cannot believe God wanted these things to happen to you, but I do believe that all things happen for a reason and are part of a greater plan that we can only hope to comprehend one day.<br/>\n <br/>\nTo the person that hurt you this badly I say, There is nothing worse than someone who commits atrocities and claims to be a Godly person.  To me this is perversion in it&#39;s worst form.<br/>\n <br/>\nTo you I say, You are not and never were useless, and I know that God loved you the whole time.  I cannot explain why you were allowed to be abused or why millions are hurt and suffer and starve etc.  I have also gone through things, (not a severe as yours, but pretty awful) that I don&#39;t understand.  But, you know what?  God is using my hurtful experiences, even now, to reach out with compassion to others, because I&#39;ve been there and I can relate to them.<br/>\n <br/>\nI may have way overstepped  my bounds here, but I felt so moved by what you said, I had to say something.
