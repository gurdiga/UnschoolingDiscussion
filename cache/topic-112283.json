Someone on another list also found it for me! Looking over the lyrics I&#39;m not sure where I thought I&#39;d heard &quot;bounty&quot; at but then again, trying to listen closely AND drive and with 3 kids chattering at me LOL :-) <br/>\n   <br/>\n  To explain a little, Sarah has been asking me about song lyrics quite often. I realized there are many songs I&#39;m so used to hearing that I don&#39;t LISTEN to them so I&#39;ve been making a conscious effort to listen to the lyrics of songs, and this came up and I wondered if it was about the HMS Bounty, realized I don&#39;t even know much more than that an infamous mutany occured on a ship by the name of HMS Bounty! So I&#39;m off to look it up anyways, even if this song doesn&#39;t actually relate. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Beth<br/>\n<br/>\nRen Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &quot;  At the end I think there&#39;s a flute in the background and it&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m<br/>\ngetting<br/>\ncloser to my home!
