Neither have most of the other people<br/>\n&gt;&gt; here,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; so it is difficult for them to counter even some of the most simplistic<br/>\n&gt;&gt; arguments, without the ability to draw upon and articulate those somewhat<br/>\n&gt;&gt; more complex concepts. It doesn&#39;t make you right, it just makes it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; frustrating and annoying to watch the process.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; This is not a good place to argue economics -  people  are not here because<br/>\n&gt;&gt; they are interested in that. If I thought they were, I&#39;d jump in and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; provide<br/>\n&gt;&gt; plenty of arguments, based on sound economic reasoning, for why it DOES<br/>\n&gt;&gt; make<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sense, in a mixed economy, such as that of the United States, for some of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; our<br/>\n&gt;&gt; tax dollars to be used for educating other people&#39;s children and for a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; number<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of other purposes.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; However, like I said, people did not COME to this list to argue economics,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; not even the economics of public school financing. A really good place for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that kind of argument, if you want to do it with other homeschoolers, is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; NHEN-Legislative yahoogroups list.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Please EVERYONE ELSE WHO IS NOT INTERESTED --- the way list topics get<br/>\n&gt;&gt; perpetuated is by people responding to them - you vote with your own posts<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; . If you want these kinds of threads to die a natural death, stop<br/>\n&gt;&gt; responding<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to them, no matter how difficult that may be. Those who ARE interested and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; want to continue - please make the subject line clear so that the rest of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; us<br/>\n&gt;&gt; can delete the messages more easily.
