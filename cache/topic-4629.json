I believe in it but I feel like <br/>\nit&#39;s so hard to live up to my ideals because I wasn&#39;t raised that way and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t see it in the people I know.  I know there are people out there, like <br/>\nmany of you on this list, and that&#39;s why this group is so much help to me but <br/>\nI wish that I could really see it in practice.  <br/>\n   I find myself instead looking to a few fictional characters, like the mom <br/>\n(Marmy) in Little Women.  My kids know that she&#39;s one of my ideals and so <br/>\nwhen I lose my patience and yell or whatever, they joke with me, &quot;That wasn&#39;t <br/>\nvery Marmy-like.&quot;  Anyway, just wondered if you struggle with this also and <br/>\nwhat any of you may have done to find role models or learn new ways of being <br/>\nand have them stick.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Lucy in Calif.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4624,"nextTopicId":4531}}
