I <br/>\ntried to keep the whole unschooling idea in the closet, hidden from <br/>\nher so I wouldn&#39;t have to try to explain the idea behind it all.

That I have learned far <br/>\nbeyond what she or any public school has taught me. That I went on to <br/>\nlearn things in areas that interest me. I know I don&#39;t live my life <br/>\nor raise my children to make her happy but it bothers me when I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave her support. Does anyone know how I could handle this situation <br/>\nbetter? I get so upset and teary eyed everytime she puts me down for <br/>\nwhat I feel like is best for my children.
