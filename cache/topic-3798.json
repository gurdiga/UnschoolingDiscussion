Mook is almost three and has no intention of going<br/>\nnear the toilet any time soon.  (And no, I&#39;m not worried, but everyone<br/>\nelse seems to be...)  I think each person learns what they want to learn<br/>\nat whatever age they want to learn it.  He talked early, but he wasn&#39;t<br/>\nwalking until almost a year and a half.  He knows when he needs practice<br/>\nat something - not me.  Sometimes he&#39;ll just come up to me and say,<br/>\n&quot;Mom, let&#39;s talk in English.&quot;  OK, I guess he feels he needs practice<br/>\nspeaking English.  He just knows.  I imagine every kid just knows. <br/>\nThat&#39;s probably why some kids are &quot;problem&quot; kids in school.  They know<br/>\nthat they don&#39;t need practice at what the teacher is trying to teach<br/>\nthem.  Jets or bugs or whatever are just more important to them at that<br/>\ntime.  Maybe they already know what is being taught (or don&#39;t need to<br/>\nknow right now), and want to explore the real world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI loved that John Holt&#39;s book How Children Learn.  I finally made it<br/>\nthrough, and then reread it.  It was slow going for me at first, but I<br/>\nfound I agreed with almost everything he said.  (Which is unusual for me<br/>\n- I rarely agree with half of what I read or hear - hope that didn&#39;t<br/>\noffend anybody...)  If we just trust our kids, they&#39;ll learn what they<br/>\nneed to learn.

I remember many<br/>\nnights with he and my mother both in tears as they sat at the dining room<br/>\ntable trying to force him to learn to read.  Finally, that summer while we<br/>\nwere on the highway headed somewhere for vacation and my dad was reading us<br/>\n&quot;Last of the Mohicans.&quot;  He handed the book to my brother at a climactic<br/>\nscene and said &quot;I&#39;m tired, you read for a while.&quot;  So he did!  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo this day my dad is still &quot;proud&quot; of that and tells that story.  I find<br/>\nit interesting, and sad, that he can feel justified claiming the credit for<br/>\n&quot;teaching&quot; my brother to read, when my brother so obviously did it himself.<br/>\n Despite all the school&#39;s efforts, and my mother&#39;s as well, to force him to<br/>\nread, pidgeon-holing him and catagorizing him as a slow reader/learner or<br/>\nwhatever, he STILL learned to read all by himself when HE was ready.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI distinctly remember the whole process and all of the emotion involved for<br/>\neveryone.  Even as a small child I remember keeping a low profile and not<br/>\nreminding him of the fact that I (his year younger sister) was reading at<br/>\n4.  It was just too obvious how painful the whole process was for him, and<br/>\nsibling rivalry just flew out the window.  It makes me wonder how my<br/>\nparents could NOT have seen the obvious.  That they should just back off as<br/>\nwell, and that torturing him did not help the issue at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he is a very technically skilled reader with a voracious literary<br/>\nappetite.  He reads very complicated Science Fiction, History, etc for fun<br/>\nand finds it not the least challenging.  If that is not a story of<br/>\nperserverence and overcoming being labeled, I don&#39;t what is.  7 - 8 even 9<br/>\n- 10 are not &quot;late&quot; readers.  They are just so busy being precocious in<br/>\nother areas that they do not have the time or the interest in learning to<br/>\nread, and should not be made to feel less for that.  My brother has always<br/>\nbeen very mechanically oriented and loved to take things apart.  He ended<br/>\nup doing four years in the Navy as an electronics technician for Viking<br/>\njets, and is now beginning to study engineering, with a side interest (and<br/>\nlots of knowledge) in computers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave faith.

They come equipped with<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mental apparatus to figure it out.  Keep out of their way and offer<br/>\n&gt; assistance<br/>\n&gt; &gt;when it is asked for in the amount it is asked for.  The variety of people<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;learning styles makes generalization very risky at best and is always made<br/>\n&gt; &gt;useless for the many outside the generalization.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m assuming, Joel, that you were referring to what I wrote as<br/>\n&gt; generalization.  And that I was implying that this was *the* way to go, as a<br/>\n&gt; Fact.  Insofar as any comment or suggestion would be a generalization, I<br/>\n&gt; guess you&#39;re right, but I certainly didn&#39;t think of it as one.  In fact<br/>\n&gt; quite the opposite--did you miss where I said &quot;this is my bias&quot;, &quot;this is my<br/>\n&gt; personal professional bias&quot; etc.  several times and that I was just offering<br/>\n&gt; one more idea?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or was it the theoretical discussion that upset you?  I was offering, as I<br/>\n&gt; understood it, another suggestion for things to do (in a long line of things<br/>\n&gt; to do) in response to a post by a mother who was asking on behalf of a child<br/>\n&gt; who wants to learn to read.  I did include a fair bit of theoretical frame<br/>\n&gt; around it because I hadn&#39;t seen mentioned any approach that started with<br/>\n&gt; meaningful units of more than one word rather than letters or a word and I<br/>\n&gt; thought maybe the idea needed some introduction.  Actually, I was trying to<br/>\n&gt; *counter* the implicit theoretical &quot;generalization&quot; that learning reading<br/>\n&gt; happened by learning letters first (except for the whole word idea) that<br/>\n&gt; seemed to apply in people&#39;s suggestions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some people don&#39;t think of reading as making meaning even at the emergent<br/>\n&gt; stages because we&#39;re so schooled to think of it as intrinsically bottom-up,<br/>\n&gt; phonics and such.  The bottom-up model (and the associated politics and<br/>\n&gt; interpersonal dynamics--building on perceived lack of knowledge of a set<br/>\n&gt; body of knowledge rather than on strengths and interests) is actually a<br/>\n&gt; recent product of the industrial age, and some learners can work with it,<br/>\n&gt; while other learners can&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or was it the step-by-step process I described?  I could have just said &quot;you<br/>\n&gt; can write what your daughter says and it can be another thing for her to<br/>\n&gt; read if she wants&quot; but broke down the process because it seemed that it<br/>\n&gt; might be unfamiliar and people would want to be able to envision *one* way<br/>\n&gt; it might go.  If one were to break down the process of writing letters in<br/>\n&gt; the mud, I suspect it might look like a step-by-step process as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d be the first to say flexibility and following a learner&#39;s lead including<br/>\n&gt; keeping out of their way is an utterly necessary factor not only in reading,<br/>\n&gt; but in all learning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since the learner was rebelling against a set curriculum, being prepared to<br/>\n&gt; do the kind of stuff I was talking about instead seemed like a good thing to<br/>\n&gt; have ready if it ever came up.  The poster didn&#39;t seem to have this kind of<br/>\n&gt; tool in her toolbox (please forgive me if I was wrong, but ordering &quot;Teach<br/>\n&gt; your child to read in 100 easy lessons&quot; seems very much further away from<br/>\n&gt; unschooling than having a way to help a kid translate her/his experiences<br/>\n&gt; into written, readable text.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So sorry if it was unhelpful or seemed offensive.  I offered it in a spirit<br/>\n&gt; of one more idea to try, and why to think about trying it when other things<br/>\n&gt; seemed to have failed.

And that I was implying that this was *the* way to go, as a<br/>\nFact.  Insofar as any comment or suggestion would be a generalization, I<br/>\nguess you&#39;re right, but I certainly didn&#39;t think of it as one.  In fact<br/>\nquite the opposite--did you miss where I said &quot;this is my bias&quot;, &quot;this is my<br/>\npersonal professional bias&quot; etc.  several times and that I was just offering<br/>\none more idea?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr was it the theoretical discussion that upset you?  I was offering, as I<br/>\nunderstood it, another suggestion for things to do (in a long line of things<br/>\nto do) in response to a post by a mother who was asking on behalf of a child<br/>\nwho wants to learn to read.  I did include a fair bit of theoretical frame<br/>\naround it because I hadn&#39;t seen mentioned any approach that started with<br/>\nmeaningful units of more than one word rather than letters or a word and I<br/>\nthought maybe the idea needed some introduction.  Actually, I was trying to<br/>\n*counter* the implicit theoretical &quot;generalization&quot; that learning reading<br/>\nhappened by learning letters first (except for the whole word idea) that<br/>\nseemed to apply in people&#39;s suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people don&#39;t think of reading as making meaning even at the emergent<br/>\nstages because we&#39;re so schooled to think of it as intrinsically bottom-up,<br/>\nphonics and such.  The bottom-up model (and the associated politics and<br/>\ninterpersonal dynamics--building on perceived lack of knowledge of a set<br/>\nbody of knowledge rather than on strengths and interests) is actually a<br/>\nrecent product of the industrial age, and some learners can work with it,<br/>\nwhile other learners can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr was it the step-by-step process I described?  I could have just said &quot;you<br/>\ncan write what your daughter says and it can be another thing for her to<br/>\nread if she wants&quot; but broke down the process because it seemed that it<br/>\nmight be unfamiliar and people would want to be able to envision *one* way<br/>\nit might go.  If one were to break down the process of writing letters in<br/>\nthe mud, I suspect it might look like a step-by-step process as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be the first to say flexibility and following a learner&#39;s lead including<br/>\nkeeping out of their way is an utterly necessary factor not only in reading,<br/>\nbut in all learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the learner was rebelling against a set curriculum, being prepared to<br/>\ndo the kind of stuff I was talking about instead seemed like a good thing to<br/>\nhave ready if it ever came up.  The poster didn&#39;t seem to have this kind of<br/>\ntool in her toolbox (please forgive me if I was wrong, but ordering &quot;Teach<br/>\nyour child to read in 100 easy lessons&quot; seems very much further away from<br/>\nunschooling than having a way to help a kid translate her/his experiences<br/>\ninto written, readable text.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo sorry if it was unhelpful or seemed offensive.  I offered it in a spirit<br/>\nof one more idea to try, and why to think about trying it when other things<br/>\nseemed to have failed.

(I&#39;m sure hoping that I haven&#39;t missed any<br/>\nposts on this topic in which the suggestions below were brought up--if so,<br/>\nplease excuse my shoddy groping through my 200 or so e-mails a day [I&#39;m a<br/>\nlistserv pack rat])...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd be warned: my bias is whole language: I fully believe that building on<br/>\nstrengths moving from the meaningful whole to the component part is the most<br/>\naffirming, constructive way to learn--well, anything, reading included.  So<br/>\nletters don&#39;t precede words--meaning comes first, with the components coming<br/>\non that foundation.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst thing I&#39;d say: packaged curricula can be de facto intimidating,<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s like looking up a 12 foot wall, even if there are footholds at<br/>\neach step.  You still know that *someone* expects you to get *this* far at<br/>\nsome point.  It also doesn&#39;t necessarily relate to the learner&#39;s life, and<br/>\nwe all know how being forced to read particular stuff can irritate you and<br/>\nturn you off.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, a classic early activity for learners who have basically no<br/>\nconnection to print at all is called &quot;Language experience&quot;.  The idea is<br/>\nthat it&#39;s easiest to read something that *you* wrote, that is directly<br/>\nmeaningful text generated by *you*.  Further, you break down into the<br/>\n*tiniest* steps possible, the distance between her experience and the<br/>\nwritten word.  Between living and reading and writing.  BTW, what Linda<br/>\nsuggested about drawing illustrations and then dictating captions is a<br/>\nsmaller, word-by-word version of this.  (My own bias about what&#39;s called<br/>\n&quot;whole-word&quot;:  it&#39;s better than straight bottom-up phonics, but it&#39;s still<br/>\nwords out of context.  Communicating meaning is what reading is about,<br/>\nultimately, not recognizing words.  So begin with the purpose of<br/>\nreading--real meaning--and go from there.  Again, this is my personal<br/>\nprofessional perspective.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll only generally outline the process--if this is not repetitive and<br/>\nyou&#39;re interested, I could fill you in on details and fine points...So you<br/>\ncan sit and talk with your daughter about something and then ask if you can<br/>\nwrite one sentence of what she just said.  For instance: &quot;We picked apples<br/>\ntoday.&quot;  A short sentence is good.  Then you can read it back to her.  Maybe<br/>\ntwice.  Pointing at the words.  Then you can start shadow reading it with<br/>\nher--she kind of whispers while you read along.  Gradually, over many<br/>\nrepetitions, you can fade out and she can take over.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it&#39;s memorization.  If you look at it, that&#39;s what reading is--it&#39;s<br/>\njust so highlighted here because the process is broken down into its bare<br/>\nbones.  But that&#39;s the first step.  And these words are *hers*.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce she can read the sentence all by herself (which is a cool thing!), you<br/>\ncan move from the meaningful whole to the component parts.  You can ask her<br/>\nwhat particular words are in the sentence.  I&#39;d start with first and last<br/>\nwords, then move to meaningful words e.g. apples or picked.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeriodically, let her go back and read it all together to keep the meaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you can improvise--if she wants to learn the words even more out of<br/>\ncontext, you can write a few of them on cards and she can identify them,<br/>\nlike flash cards except they&#39;re *her* words.  And make sure to write the<br/>\nwhole sentence on the other side of the card, with the relevant word<br/>\nunderlined.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she wants to add more to her story, you can add another sentence.  It<br/>\ncould get quite long, if you all want.  And before you know it, she&#39;s<br/>\nwritten a piece about a significant event in her life that she can read and<br/>\ncontrol forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can break down to component parts even more, e.g. sounds of consonants<br/>\nand vowels (always in combination)...but I won&#39;t bother with that right now,<br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t even know if this is interesting to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople in the programs I worked in would do language experiences for months.<br/>\nNot the same one, but the same basic process.   It was totally emotionally<br/>\nrewarding to watch people who had never thought their lives related in any<br/>\nway to a written narrative put experiences they wanted to document down on<br/>\npaper  (there were plenty of experiences they didn&#39;t want to document, of<br/>\ncourse--but that&#39;s another story).  It&#39;s a tremendously empowering thing.<br/>\nAnyway, *Then*, later, when your daughter feels like it, and feels some<br/>\ncontrol over words and patterns and such, she can move to other people&#39;s<br/>\nwriting.  Maybe *your* writing about experiences she knows about.  That<br/>\nwould be a wonderful next bridge.  Just off the top of my head, I envision<br/>\nsomething like &quot;The sun shone on my daughter&#39;s hair&quot; as a companion story to<br/>\nthe apple-picking.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the process to other people&#39;s experiences and thoughts is rushed at all,<br/>\nyou can break the fragile connection between written symbols and meaning<br/>\nthat your daughter&#39;s trying to build.  Just glory in the connection of oral<br/>\nand written narration or description.  It&#39;s phenomenal.  (Do you think I<br/>\nmiss my work? :))  If you feel like something is too much of a stretch, you<br/>\ncan go back and find the solid foundation under your feet.  That&#39;s the<br/>\nbeauty of this methodology.   There&#39;s always solid meaning to fall back on.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I&#39;d offer this idea.

I trusted my instincts and also received confirmation from<br/>\nhelpful &quot;experts&quot; at that time.  I have ultimately learned that one of the<br/>\ngreatest gifts my daughter has received from homeschooling is not feeling<br/>\npressured or rushed to learn how to read.  As a teenager, she now loves to<br/>\nawaken to new adventures and to life-long learning through this marvelous,<br/>\nacquired skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs with crawling, walking, talking, etc., each child is developmentally<br/>\nready to master certain skills when their brains (and other body parts!) are<br/>\nready.  Reading is a similar skill.  Before a child can read, s/he often<br/>\nneeds to perform larger movements with their body.  Some helpful exercises<br/>\nthat we did together in fun ways are:  (1) Have your dd write alphabet<br/>\nletters, shapes, etc. with large, non-permanent chalk and markers (when<br/>\napplicable) on big chalkboards, whiteboards, sidewalks, etc.  She can<br/>\nimitate the letter(s) you draw, or create them on her own.  This involves<br/>\nher large motor skills and the left-brain/right-brain connections are<br/>\neventually made with greater ease.  (2)  Fill a cookie sheet with a thin<br/>\nlayer of sand, salt, sugar, flour (or whatever!) and have her use her<br/>\nfinger(s) or utensils to draw alphabet letters (and eventually words) in the<br/>\ntactile stuff.  (3)  You (or another loved one or friend) can draw letters,<br/>\netc. on your dd&#39;s back with an index or other finger and have her feel what<br/>\nis being drawn.  Eventually, you can draw more letters, until short words<br/>\nare spelled.  (4) Carving alphabet letters (or purchasing some from<br/>\nteachers&#39; supplies stores) from sponges, sandpaper, or other textured<br/>\nmaterials can be a fun, tactile activity.   Using cookie and other dough is<br/>\nalso helpful and creative.  These letters can be arranged to make small<br/>\nwords, etc.  (5)  Have your dd make her own books.  Collate paper and even<br/>\nmake covers with construction paper or other materials.  She can draw<br/>\npictures (illustrations) under which you add printed words, which are<br/>\ndictated to you by her.  This can lead to having her draw the pictures and<br/>\ndictate the wording, but having you draw dots for each letter, which she<br/>\nfills in.  Rhyming books are especially helpful.  Kids seem to like the<br/>\ncadence, etc.  It&#39;s also easier to re-read a rhyming piece.  &quot;Sam sat.  Sam<br/>\nis a rat.&quot; was one of my dd&#39;s first projects.  She was so proud of her<br/>\nefforts! &lt;nostalgic sigh&gt;  (6)  Do cross-crawl exercises (as described in<br/>\nBrain Gym and other helpful books and resources).  Sometimes, when a child<br/>\nhas been held, carried, etc. as an infant, they do not master the usual<br/>\ncrawling technique which actually integrates right- and left-brain<br/>\nhemispheres.  (7)  Read, read, read to your dd!  She&#39;ll learn this wonderful<br/>\nskill just by sitting close to you and hearing treasured stories.  (I was<br/>\ntaught in public school not to run my finger under each word as I read.<br/>\nWrong!  This is sometimes a very helpful tool that assists our children in<br/>\nlearning to read by sounding out each letter and connecting them to make a<br/>\nword.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that others can provide additional hints and strategies.  It&#39;s late,<br/>\nand I&#39;m probably leaving out some of the activities that we did, but please<br/>\nremember that kids do pick up on our frustrations, fears, etc.  We obviously<br/>\ndon&#39;t want reading to have any negative associations.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter became developmentally ready to read when she was about 9 years<br/>\nold.  For some children (especially boys, I&#39;m told), reading readiness<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t occur until they&#39;re even 10 or older!  The interesting result in my<br/>\nown dd&#39;s situation is that when her reading skills &quot;kicked in,&quot; she was in<br/>\nwhat would be 4th grade, but she actually whipped through early readers and,<br/>\nin a matter of months, was reading books that were of high school level and<br/>\nbeyond!  She had seen the Jodie Foster movie, &quot;Contact&quot;, and became<br/>\ninterested in quantum and astro-physics.  She began to read books on these<br/>\nsubjects and communicated by e-mail with a scientist and professor at MIT.<br/>\nWhat an accomplishment for someone who seemingly struggled with this skill<br/>\nfor so many years!  Just the other day, my dd shared with me that reading<br/>\nhas opened up so many doors to learning for her.  She loves to read and<br/>\nreads so well!<br/>\n<br/>\nSuz, I couldn&#39;t decide whether I should send this response to you directly<br/>\nor post it to the general readership of this Unschooling Listserv.

You have to assure her<br/>\nthat it will come in her own time.

I had one child memorizing and paying<br/>\nattention to words and letters for years.. it didn&#39;t click until this<br/>\nsummer. He&#39;s 9.75, 10 in January.  I have another child who is 7.5 years<br/>\nold... he doesn&#39;t even know all of the alphabet.

Is she reacting to the subtle (maybe not so subtle) idea that she<br/>\nshould really be getting it by now and something just might be wrong with<br/>\nher???<br/>\n<br/>\nTell us about the games you play together and maybe we can brainstorm new<br/>\nthings to expose her to.

I think we all get so caught up in the what they <br/>\nare supposed to do at a certain age thing that we miss what they can do. Out <br/>\nof six, four of my boys had trouble learning to read. The school&#39;s never knew <br/>\nwhat to do either so most of the pressure fell on us to do something. <br/>\n    With the 11yro. I read and read to him and still do. Somehow the idea is <br/>\nput across that if they can&#39;t so it for themselves it is not as valuable. I <br/>\nonce bought into this but not now. I still read to him and 8yro and will as <br/>\nlong as they will listen. <br/>\n    In doing so I can expose them to books they might not read on their own. <br/>\nI have direct input into what I want them to explore. So much learning takes <br/>\nplace while we read together. We discuss words, phrases, figure of speech, <br/>\nimplied meaning,etc. All of this is woven in painlessly. I can also read <br/>\nabove their reading level but within their listening level and I even stretch <br/>\nthat at times. I always stop reading something that they say they can&#39;t <br/>\nfollow. <br/>\n    My son was telling me last night of a neighbor reading to her boys. I <br/>\ntold him I didn&#39;t know she read to them. (I know she wasn&#39;t before from <br/>\nconversation) &quot;Oh, they copied off of us&quot; he told me.

My 8yro seems <br/>\nto have done a backslide in some areas from last year when he was in a <br/>\nprivate school.<br/>\nHe can read and I do have him read to me daily but he acts as though he can&#39;t <br/>\nwrite because he can&#39;t spell anything. His writing is usually very sloppy <br/>\nalso. I worry that because I&#39;m not pushing him in this area he will never <br/>\nlearn how to write well.<br/>\n    OTOH my 11yro did not learn to read until he was 9. Today he reads very <br/>\nwell although he still doesn&#39;t want to read much.(or write) I read to both of <br/>\nthem daily. I had to listen to the questions and worried. He just was not <br/>\ngoing to read until he wanted to. I could tell because he would just refuse <br/>\nto even look at the book. He is still that way today and I have to be careful <br/>\nabout anything that looks contrived.  Don&#39;t know if this helps, but you&#39;re <br/>\nnot alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"A. Yates","from":"&quot;A.
