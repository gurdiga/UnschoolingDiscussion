That&#39;s where the <br/>\n&gt; whole concept of church buildings and formal services came from.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, Constantine provided Christians with public buildings in which to <br/>\nassemble, not temples.  The buildings were called basilicas, and in the Roman <br/>\nworld they were used as indoor marketplaces (like malls) and places for civil <br/>\nfunctions (like magistrates holding court).  Temples were shrines of a deity <br/>\nand tended to be small.  They would not have been suitable for a large <br/>\ncongregation.  Basilicas were not shrines of the Christian God but houses of <br/>\nthe church (ekklesia = the assembly called out of the world).  These <br/>\nbuildings came to be called &quot;church&quot; (i.e. assembly) only because of the <br/>\nassociation with the assembly held in them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Constantine made a lot of choices that dictated the fate of mainstream <br/>\n&gt; christianity.<br/>\n&gt; The doctrine he liked was the one that said once you convert to <br/>\n&gt; Christianity <br/>\n&gt; you were forgiven of any and all wrongdoing. So he killed a LOT of people <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; did horrid things his whole life and then converted on his deathbed. Nice <br/>\n&gt; guy.<br/>\n&gt; Mithraism would very possibly be largest world religion today had it not <br/>\n&gt; been <br/>\n&gt; for Constantine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Early Christian practice, which was in transition during the Constantinian <br/>\nage, required the baptized to give up certain professions that compromised <br/>\nthe ethical standards of Christianity.  This is why some people, who occupied <br/>\nmilitary or civil offices, became catechumens but waited until they were near <br/>\ndeath to be baptized.    It wasn&#39;t a death-bed conversion as much as a <br/>\nrecognition that Christianity stood for something that these converts weren&#39;t <br/>\nin a position to personally embody.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the popularity oif Mithraism, it was one of a dozen or more mystery <br/>\ncults with their orientalisms that so fascinated 3rd and 4th century Greeks <br/>\nand Romans.  Not too different than &quot;New Age&quot; religions today.  One would <br/>\nhave to question their staying power with or without the rapid spread of <br/>\nChristianity in the 4th and 5th centuries.  As for being one of the world&#39;s <br/>\nlargest religions, remember that the rise and spread of Islam owed little to <br/>\nChristianity, other than bumping into it in the Mediterranean world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrank and Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] christianity","postDate":"1048794890","msgId":62220,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQuZDAyYzI5Zi4yYmI0YjEwYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62217,"nextInTopic":62283,"prevInTime":62219,"nextInTime":62221,"topicId":40541,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/27/03 8:55:02 AM, unolist@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1635585642\">In a message dated 3/27/03 8:55:02 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unolist@...\">unolist@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Matthew 16:18<br/>\nAnd I tell you that you are Peter,[&lt;A <br/>\nHREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/#footnote_117158154_1&quot;\">http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/#footnote_117158154_1&quot;</a>&gt;1&lt;/A&gt;] and on <br/>\nthis rock I will build my <br/>\nchurch, and the gates of Hades[&lt;A <br/>\nHREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/#footnote_117158154_2&quot;\">http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/#footnote_117158154_2&quot;</a>&gt;2&lt;/A&gt;] will not <br/>\novercome it. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to tell us what real term he was using and what it meant at the <br/>\ntime, because &quot;church&quot; was not the word.

From 312-320 Constantine was tolerant of<br/>\npaganism, keeping pagan gods on coins and retaining his pagan high<br/>\npriest title &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot; in order to maintain popularity with<br/>\nhis subjects, possibly indicating that he never understood the<br/>\ntheology of Christianity. From 320-330 he began to attack paganism<br/>\nthrough the government but in many cases persuaded people to follow<br/>\nthe laws by combining pagan worship with Christianity. He made<br/>\nDecember 25th, the birthday of the pagan Unconquered Sun god, the<br/>\nofficial holiday it is now--the birthday of Jesus. It is likely that<br/>\nhe also instituted celebrating Easter and Lent based on pagan<br/>\nholidays. From 330-337 Constantine stepped up his destruction of<br/>\npaganism, and during this time his mother, Helen, made a pilgrimage<br/>\nto Jerusalem and began excavations to recover artifacts in the city.<br/>\nThis popularized the tradition of pilgrimages in Christianity.<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Because of my own<br/>\nexperience in the Christian church I have seen how<br/>\nmost people even those who teach about world religions<br/>\nhaven&#39;t a clue about the spirituality of a belief.  <br/>\nIt is the head knowledge they teach about not the<br/>\nheart knowledge. This applies to anything not just a<br/>\ndiscussion on faith.  One who does not unschool cannot<br/>\npossibly teach about it, he can teach about what he<br/>\nknows from a book or from what others have told him<br/>\nbut not from his own experience.  Someone who is not a<br/>\nparent cannot possibly write a book on parenting until<br/>\nhe walks the walk of a parent such can be said for any<br/>\nbelief.  It is the heart knowledge that makes it a<br/>\nbelief and the head knowledge without the heart<br/>\nknowledge that makes it a religion.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie<br/>\n--- gruvystarchild &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;Christianity comes from Christ, religion is man<br/>\n&gt; made.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; How do you figure?
