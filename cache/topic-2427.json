But we decided that time together and experiences <br/>\n(i.e., classes and traveling) are more important than things.

However, not being<br/>\nconcerned about &quot;appearances&quot; or about social climbing can be lonely in a<br/>\nvery conservative area like ours :-(...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my distaste and often utter digust with that part of our culture<br/>\nbegan for me with my mother and her status conscience (more like paranoid<br/>\nor obsessive) behavior and her materialism.  She told me she used to have<br/>\nHighschool friends (in the early 1950&#39;s) drop her off down the block from<br/>\nher brand new house and she would walk up to someone else&#39;s door as if it<br/>\nwere hers until they were out of sight because her house did not have<br/>\nlandscaping in yet (Gasp! Shocking!)  She also never had any kind of a real<br/>\nrelationship with me and substituted gifts for her time and attention or<br/>\naffection.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think another big step for me away from equating gifts with affection and<br/>\nworrying about status of opinions was my wedding.  We had a change of plans<br/>\nwhen we first started planning our wedding and ended up having a very<br/>\nprivate ceremony on San Juan Island in Puget Sound with only our parents<br/>\ninvited as witnesses and a lovely weekend on the Island in a B&B honeymoon<br/>\ncottage.  We got cards from some (not all!) of my siblings, and a gift or<br/>\ntwo in the mail after the fact, but we never even got a gift from my<br/>\nparents and we footed the bill for everything from the little cake to the<br/>\nbouquet/corsages.  In retrospect it is one of my happiest memories and I<br/>\nwould not have wanted it any other way, but it was difficult at the time to<br/>\nlet go of the fantasy of a big wedding, with a great big reception and all<br/>\nour relatives in attendance.  I have a huge family and grew up<br/>\nattending/participating in lots of those type of weddings.  Now I am so<br/>\nglad that we did it the way we did, instead of what was expected. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;There should be the option to go to school or not, to learn by doing and<br/>\n&gt;apprenticeship instead of only by books and tests, to raise a family or make<br/>\n&gt;a million.
