I am the 5th of 6<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children, the first four are 12-17 yrs older than<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (quite a gap), and of them ONE graduated from ps.<br/>\n&gt; (Of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her own choice). The rest my dad had to fight to<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; able to &quot;homeschool&quot; (which ended up being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschooling) them, and so by the time I was old<br/>\n&gt; enough<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to put in school, he knew he didn&#39;t really want<br/>\n&gt; to,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but he had had so much negative thoughts on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; homeschooling thrown his way (that his kids<br/>\n&gt; wouldnt&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; learn as much, that they would be socially and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; academically handicapped, that their lives would<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; too sheltered, etc, etc, AND that the kids<br/>\n&gt; actually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; LIKED school and he was depriving them)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that I remember after I had turned 5, he, very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reluctantly sighed and asked me &quot;do you WANT to go<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; school? If you WANT to I guess you can.&quot; and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; remember thinking, I am soooo cool. I can decide<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whether or not to go to school. and I said no, (to<br/>\n&gt; his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; delight)and stayed at home all that year, learning<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; home in absolutely no structured way, just my mom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; creatively teaching me in play that my friends<br/>\n&gt; never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dreamt of having, both my parents and older<br/>\n&gt; siblings<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reading to me several times a day and ALWAYS<br/>\n&gt; before<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bed. Then the next year my &quot;best friend&quot; started<br/>\n&gt; first<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grade and all the other kids that I knew from my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; religion were starting school too, so I decided I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wanted to go. And to tell the truth in first grade<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had a blast. But only becuz I happened to have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; smaller class and the coolest teacher there, who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t believe in traditional school methods and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pacing. and thought if we wanted to learn cursive<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; first grade then she would teach us, if I wanted<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; use three pages and three days worth of story in<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; squiggle book, as opposed to the assigned one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; page/day, then &#39;go for it, you&#39;ll be a great<br/>\n&gt; writer&#39;,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and if we still needed to count on our fingers to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; figure things out, then we were allowed to. And<br/>\n&gt; here&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the cool part. I was further advanced in reading<br/>\n&gt; than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the other kids who had faithfully gone to<br/>\n&gt; kindergarten<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to learn their abc&#39;s like good little &quot;normal&quot;<br/>\n&gt; kids,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so I got to go a different grade and classroom for<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; special reading time and sometimes read to the<br/>\n&gt; younger<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kids. I stayed in ps thru 3rd grade, (in 2nd, I<br/>\n&gt; saw my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; actual teacher about a third of the year cuz of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; horrible health problems, and we had substitutes<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most of the year and a huge class, so needless to<br/>\n&gt; say<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was pretty bored, and just went to see my<br/>\n&gt; friends<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and play for those blessed 15 minute recesses of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; playing freedom), in 3rd grade, the only thing I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really enjoyed was going to &quot;gifted class&quot;, where<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were encouraged to do our own thing and learn at<br/>\n&gt; our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; own pace. Oh, and since I was raised as a<br/>\n&gt; Jehovah&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Witness and didn&#39;t celebrate a lot of the<br/>\n&gt; holidays, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was sent to the Library while the rest of the<br/>\n&gt; enormous<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class did holiday activities, which was just fine<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me, cuz reading was what I really enjoyed, --other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than daydreaming, which was considered something<br/>\n&gt; &quot;bad&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (ex: &quot;Bobbie&#39;s a really great student, has lots<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lots of potential, BUT daydreams a bit too<br/>\n&gt; much&quot;),--<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and that way I didn&#39;t have to stay and be made to<br/>\n&gt; feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bad about my beliefs by the TEACHER, who wanted<br/>\n&gt; sooo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bad to prove that I really truly did WANT so bad<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; celebrate them and my parents were just being mean<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me. The kids, being naturally unbiased and open<br/>\n&gt; minded<br/>\n&gt; &gt; never said a thing more to me about it than asking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; questions cuz it was something different to them.<br/>\n&gt; On<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the other end of it, I obviously wasn&#39;t getting<br/>\n&gt; math,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I NEVER did my math or social studies types of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; homework and would therefore end up having to stay<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; during recess and write &quot;I will do my math<br/>\n&gt; homework. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will do my math homework. I will do my math<br/>\n&gt; homework.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and THEN if I didn&#39;t finish that (due to<br/>\n&gt; daydreaming,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most likely) I had to write more sentences. And in<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; school, at 3rd grade there was already horrible<br/>\n&gt; social<br/>\n&gt; &gt; circles and cliques to try and fit into. I was in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; neither the cool nor nerd group, cuz my cool<br/>\n&gt; friends<br/>\n&gt; &gt; liked me but didn&#39;t like that I also liked and<br/>\n&gt; hung<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out with weird and nerdy kids, and my weird and<br/>\n&gt; nerdy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friends thought I must be kinda stuck up to hang<br/>\n&gt; out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and like the cool kids. I lived in constant fear<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going to the principal&#39;s office for anything and<br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so scared riding the bus, cuz I lived in a rural<br/>\n&gt; area<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and was dropped off at the end of my &quot;driveway&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was really a dirt road that seemed millions of<br/>\n&gt; miles<br/>\n&gt; &gt; long to a little easily frightened girl. In the<br/>\n&gt; middle<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of third grade, our house burned down, and my<br/>\n&gt; dad&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; brother was living in Phoenix, where he had heard<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this &quot;private school&quot; (which was what I like to<br/>\n&gt; call a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;homemade school&quot;, just started by a few<br/>\n&gt; like-minded<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>=== message truncated ===<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!

I stayed in ps thru 3rd grade, (in 2nd, I saw my<br/>\n&gt; actual teacher about a third of the year cuz of<br/>\n&gt; horrible health problems, and we had substitutes for<br/>\n&gt; most of the year and a huge class, so needless to say<br/>\n&gt; I was pretty bored, and just went to see my friends<br/>\n&gt; and play for those blessed 15 minute recesses of<br/>\n&gt; playing freedom), in 3rd grade, the only thing I<br/>\n&gt; really enjoyed was going to &quot;gifted class&quot;, where we<br/>\n&gt; were encouraged to do our own thing and learn at our<br/>\n&gt; own pace. Oh, and since I was raised as a Jehovah&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Witness and didn&#39;t celebrate a lot of the holidays, I<br/>\n&gt; was sent to the Library while the rest of the enormous<br/>\n&gt; class did holiday activities, which was just fine with<br/>\n&gt; me, cuz reading was what I really enjoyed, --other<br/>\n&gt; than daydreaming, which was considered something &quot;bad&quot;<br/>\n&gt; (ex: &quot;Bobbie&#39;s a really great student, has lots and<br/>\n&gt; lots of potential, BUT daydreams a bit too much&quot;),--<br/>\n&gt; and that way I didn&#39;t have to stay and be made to feel<br/>\n&gt; bad about my beliefs by the TEACHER, who wanted sooo<br/>\n&gt; bad to prove that I really truly did WANT so bad to<br/>\n&gt; celebrate them and my parents were just being mean to<br/>\n&gt; me. The kids, being naturally unbiased and open minded<br/>\n&gt; never said a thing more to me about it than asking<br/>\n&gt; questions cuz it was something different to them. On<br/>\n&gt; the other end of it, I obviously wasn&#39;t getting math,<br/>\n&gt; I NEVER did my math or social studies types of<br/>\n&gt; homework and would therefore end up having to stay in<br/>\n&gt; during recess and write &quot;I will do my math homework. I<br/>\n&gt; will do my math homework. I will do my math homework.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and THEN if I didn&#39;t finish that (due to daydreaming,<br/>\n&gt; most likely) I had to write more sentences. And in my<br/>\n&gt; school, at 3rd grade there was already horrible social<br/>\n&gt; circles and cliques to try and fit into. I was in<br/>\n&gt; neither the cool nor nerd group, cuz my cool friends<br/>\n&gt; liked me but didn&#39;t like that I also liked and hung<br/>\n&gt; out with weird and nerdy kids, and my weird and nerdy<br/>\n&gt; friends thought I must be kinda stuck up to hang out<br/>\n&gt; and like the cool kids. I lived in constant fear of<br/>\n&gt; going to the principal&#39;s office for anything and was<br/>\n&gt; so scared riding the bus, cuz I lived in a rural area<br/>\n&gt; and was dropped off at the end of my &quot;driveway&quot;, which<br/>\n&gt; was really a dirt road that seemed millions of miles<br/>\n&gt; long to a little easily frightened girl. In the middle<br/>\n&gt; of third grade, our house burned down, and my dad&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; brother was living in Phoenix, where he had heard of<br/>\n&gt; this &quot;private school&quot; (which was what I like to call a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;homemade school&quot;, just started by a few like-minded<br/>\n&gt; parents who wanted to be in charge of their kids and<br/>\n&gt; their learning activities and associations and still<br/>\n&gt; let them have a &quot;school&quot; with friends to go to.) So me<br/>\n&gt; and my little sister (2yrs younger) went there, and my<br/>\n&gt; mom and oldest sister became teachers there, and I had<br/>\n&gt; a great time. I went thru 5th, (my mom taught<br/>\n&gt; 5th..there was only one class per grade) and I loved<br/>\n&gt; it, but mostly becuz it was sooo unstructured, and<br/>\n&gt; huge amounts of personal attention. The teachers were<br/>\n&gt; like extended family, who respected your strengths and<br/>\n&gt; weaknesses and beliefs and my dad was almost the<br/>\n&gt; principal at one point. Then we decided to move back<br/>\n&gt; to New Mexico and I said there was no way on God&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; green earth I was going to go to middle school. So I<br/>\n&gt; took Calvert homeschool. Or at least ordered the<br/>\n&gt; course and did some work out of it every once and<br/>\n&gt; awhile. Then ordered American school, and still like<br/>\n&gt; to study in those just for the sake of refreshing my<br/>\n&gt; brain cells sometimes. All of my friends have always<br/>\n&gt; been older than me. Not becuz I was socially<br/>\n&gt; handicapped with kids my age, but becuz frankly, they<br/>\n&gt; bored me. And irritated me with their pettiness in<br/>\n&gt; always trying to be &quot;cool&quot; and fit in. My best friend<br/>\n&gt; for a long time was 6 years older than me and people<br/>\n&gt; always thought she must be babysitting me. :) My<br/>\n&gt; point? oh yeah. (I promise there is one)<br/>\n&gt; Homeschooling kids ARE different. They haven&#39;t been<br/>\n&gt; corrupted with the need to conform in every way of<br/>\n&gt; their being, right down to the way they think and how<br/>\n&gt; long they think on each subject, and HEAVEN FORBID<br/>\n&gt; they use their imaginations to their full potential. <br/>\n&gt; And the reason I got started on this whole tangent<br/>\n&gt; (THANKYOU BOBBIE PLEEEEZE FINISH UP HERE) is that as<br/>\n&gt; an adult, by nature, I suppose, I deal with a lot of<br/>\n&gt; social phobia (in myself) and there was a point in my<br/>\n&gt; life where it was really bad, and in general have<br/>\n&gt; dealt with phobias and stuff like that my whole life.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t like dealing with public figures and dread<br/>\n&gt; having confrontations of any sort sometimes. My POINT<br/>\n&gt; though, is, that when other ADULTS hear this about me,<br/>\n&gt; they have the nerve to say &quot;Oh yeah, weren&#39;t you<br/>\n&gt; homeschooled?&quot; And I have heard the argument soooooo<br/>\n&gt; many times that the homeschooled kids they know either<br/>\n&gt; grow up to be way dumber than most kids or way<br/>\n&gt; smarter, but either way are socially handicapped and<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know how to interact with others at all in their<br/>\n&gt; adult life. I maintain that PUBLIC School started<br/>\n&gt; planting the seeds of social phobia and handicapping<br/>\n&gt; in me, cuz I was &quot;different&quot; and didn&#39;t fit the mold<br/>\n&gt; of a &quot;normal&quot; all American apple pie sort of girl, so<br/>\n&gt; I was made to feel as though I needed to change.<br/>\n&gt; Fortunately, thanks to my parents teaching me at home<br/>\n&gt; BEFORE first grade, I had that one thing going for me,<br/>\n&gt; that I loved to read, and was at a middle school level<br/>\n&gt; in 3rd grade, and the &quot;gifted class&quot; teachers loved<br/>\n&gt; that. But kids who are just thrown into school feet<br/>\n&gt; first and aren&#39;t considered &quot;gifted&quot; don&#39;t even have<br/>\n&gt; THAT advantage. One ounce of &quot;different&quot; and they are<br/>\n&gt; either in need of Ritalin or &quot;poor students&quot;. I think<br/>\n&gt; unschooling PREVENTS social handicaps and helps heal<br/>\n&gt; already planted ones, especially if we do expose our<br/>\n&gt; children to other people and situations. My son is the<br/>\n&gt; only kid at McDonald&#39;s playlands and parks who<br/>\n&gt; actually takes the initiative and says in his most<br/>\n&gt; friendly voice &quot;Hi. I&#39;m my name is Satori. Wanna play<br/>\n&gt; with me?&quot; Sometimes he meets no answer at all, cuz,<br/>\n&gt; following in the footsteps of his mom he is by no<br/>\n&gt; means &quot;normal&quot; and sadly a lot of these kids are<br/>\n&gt; already behaving like biased adults. THAT, to me, is a<br/>\n&gt; social handicap. <br/>\n&gt; -Bobbie <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

I just can&#39;t get over it. This list<br/>\n&gt; rocks my world.

I can&#39;t beleive it!<br/>\n&gt; This is great! Yes! Rock on!&quot;, etc )<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ever since my son (5) was born I&#39;ve been talking and<br/>\n&gt; planning and trying to convince people that this was<br/>\n&gt; NOT just out of laziness and in fact, SOME people who<br/>\n&gt; know me and my lack of ....structure and following<br/>\n&gt; traditional &quot;rules&quot;, think that homeschooling would be<br/>\n&gt; a bad idea for my kids cuz we&#39;ll &quot;never DO it&quot;. and At<br/>\n&gt; first I was doing the sit down and do so much<br/>\n&gt; schoolwork per day thing and it broke my heart to see<br/>\n&gt; that my son dreaded that time. Thought it was no fun.<br/>\n&gt; Totally defeated my purpose of keeping him home. <br/>\n&gt; I LOVED hearing about your son learning multiplication<br/>\n&gt; with his stuffed animals! (That was the teary eyed<br/>\n&gt; part) :) Thanks for sharing. <br/>\n&gt; -bobbie <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; P.S. Any suggestions from anyone on how to instill in<br/>\n&gt; my kids a love ...or even an interest in things that<br/>\n&gt; sadly just don&#39;t do it for me, specifically math and<br/>\n&gt; parts and aspects of history, mostly like<br/>\n&gt; political/governmental aspects? If they BORE the life<br/>\n&gt; out of me, how am I supposed to make them fun for him?<br/>\n&gt; Math right now is cool, cuz he is just learning the<br/>\n&gt; only part that ever interested me (adding and<br/>\n&gt; subtracting and money stuff), but later on I know his<br/>\n&gt; stepdad will have to step in cuz ds and dd will be<br/>\n&gt; able to pick up on my vibes of disinterest, which I<br/>\n&gt; really don&#39;t want to pass on.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ChipandLaura@...\">ChipandLaura@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am soooo glad to have found this group.

I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enjoyed the Charlotte Mason<br/>\n&gt; &gt; method and a few pre packaged curriculums, and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; book &quot;the Well Trained <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mind&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The book actually gave me great ideas on the kids<br/>\n&gt; &gt; keeping notebooks on worms<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and such!  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; But, I always fell away from what I was doing, no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; matter how much I enjoyed <br/>\n&gt; &gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I found the kids saying &quot;Awwww&quot; when I called them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to &quot;do school&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I had heard of unschooling, but so many had acted<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like it was a &quot;too far out&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; idea or possibly even unchristian..that I had not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; looked seriously.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; YIPEE!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Like minded people!  I&#39;m NOT lazy!  hahhahahahha..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; boy does that feel good!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A perfect example of how unschooling works.  We like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the Math U See <br/>\n&gt; &gt; curriculum.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Multiplication was just not clicking with Jeremy so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I gave myself permission <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just put it away.  I would simply ask him a question<br/>\n&gt; &gt; once in awhile, and if he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hesitated, I would supply the answer, offering a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; brief explanation of how I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; got the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; answer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; About two weeks after starting this, Jeremy was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; playing with his stuffed <br/>\n&gt; &gt; animal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; collection on his top bunk.  He began arranging them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in groups of three.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; At 11 pm that night, he came flying out of his room,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yelling &quot;Three, Three <br/>\n&gt; &gt; times!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s NINE!&quot;  And took us in to show us the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different groupings  and how they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; represented numbers, etc.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was elated.  Not only did he know multiplication,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but he SAW how it worked,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he didn&#39;t just blindly memorize answers!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The next day he happily sat down and filled in about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 4 chapters of his math <br/>\n&gt; &gt; book,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; willingly, without being asked!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I LOVE this!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nice to meet you all!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Laura<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
