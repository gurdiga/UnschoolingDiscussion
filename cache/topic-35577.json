The basic shtick was that 516 pennies<br/>\nwill have a specific height when stacked - and that a PVC pipe<br/>\nwill hold that stack up.  Whichever candidate&#39;s &quot;pipe&quot; got full<br/>\nfirst was the winner.  We were having some friends with young<br/>\nkids up to watch the returns;  I was mainly looking for an<br/>\nentertaining way to occupy them, while keeping them involved in<br/>\nthe events.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst you have to make several stacks of 10 pennies and measure<br/>\nthem.  Average the measurements.  Multiply the average by 51.6<br/>\n(for the 4 yo, that was KEWL - her own first calculator, with her<br/>\nown name on it!!!).  Cut the PVC pipe to length; label each.<br/>\nBuild a base for the 2 pipes (1x 8, 8 inches long, with a 2x4 cut<br/>\n6 inches long and drilled with a hole saw to hold the pipes up,<br/>\nglued together and all decorated with stars and &quot;stuff&quot;).  Take a<br/>\nBIG map of the United States and a list of the electoral votes<br/>\nfor each state.  Find each state and label with the number of<br/>\nvotes.  DD is pretty kinesthetic, so we prepared for that part by<br/>\ngoing to a nearby school parking lot that has a US map painted on<br/>\nit, sized maybe 50 x 125 feet.  Having &quot;walked&quot; the locations of<br/>\neach state, she didn&#39;t have to have much help finding them on the<br/>\nmap and marking the number of votes.  Counted out a 1000 plus<br/>\npennies (where upon I was informed that it would have been a heck<br/>\nof a lot easier to take $10 to the bank and get rolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nPut markers by the map on the floor and a bowl of the pennies.<br/>\nThey colored in each state as it was called, counted out the<br/>\npennies and put them in the right tube, which meant there were<br/>\nseveral tasks for each event, letting everybody have turns at<br/>\neverything.  Of course this particular election ended up<br/>\nproviding more that the usual opportunities; enough so we could<br/>\nhave developed a HS commune by the time it was done, but the kids<br/>\nwere tuckered and sleeping before it got too crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dacunefare@...\">dacunefare@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 22, 2002 12:33 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Getting math (was Math<br/>\nexperiences)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| **Even better than plastic counters are *real* things! :-)<br/>\nLeaves.
