I am in the sticks<br/>\napproximately 100 miles from both SA and Austin.  Actually we are 21 miles<br/>\nto Llano and 21 miles to Fredericksburg.  As soon as we can find good jobs<br/>\nand get our place (21 acres, house, antique log cabin, and several<br/>\noutbuildings) on the market, we are heading for the Pacific Northwest.<br/>\nTheir highs in the daytime are lower than our lows at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelodie :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Pris &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:x_t_sipr@...\">x_t_sipr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, September 04, 2000 12:51 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Apologies from Dawn F<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;:) ... *VERY* big of you to apologize, Dawn F :)  I, for one, am quick to<br/>\n&gt;forgive &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Pris ~&gt; who&#39;z handing Dawn F a huge frosty glass of lemonade (we drink LOTS<br/>\n&gt;of lemonade @ our house on days like this) ... weatherbug now says it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;107*!!!
