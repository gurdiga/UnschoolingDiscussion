I am looking for information on th effects of TV.  <br/>\n Anyone know a good place?<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote> Good morning, Julie!  I read a book on the effects of tv earlier this <br/>\nspring, called &quot;The Plug-In Drug: Television, Children and the Family&quot; by <br/>\nMarie Winn.  It explained how children go into a trance-like state when <br/>\nwatching, and how people get addicted to it.  Also, it told how watching <br/>\nmovement on a screen affects eye muscles in a bad way.  It sites statistics <br/>\nabout how tv watching lowers academic progress, and how it can easily mess up <br/>\nfamily relationships, too.  There is proof that shows like Sesame Street do <br/>\nnot give children an educ. boost, and, in fact, have found that the fast <br/>\nmoving format of the show is done deliberately to keep the viewers &quot;glued&quot; to <br/>\nthe set.  It also showed examples of how and why kids will become so upset <br/>\nwhen unable  to watch tv.  My kids are down to watching a show or two in the <br/>\nmorning, and something in the evening before going to bed.  Before now, John <br/>\nwould cry, and want it on all of the time.  ( We have days where he still <br/>\ndoes.)  I make the kids turn it off, and go outside.  There were times that <br/>\nJohn would turn it back on if he thought I would not know!  It is better now, <br/>\nbut both boys really like tv.  It does not help that my dh also is a big tv <br/>\nfan!  On his days off from work, he always seems to have on a tv, and it <br/>\nsometimes (a lot, really) gets to me.  I do think there is a time and place <br/>\nfor tv, but I do not think it needs to be on just  because the set  is in the <br/>\nroom.  I think my dh is just as hooked as anyone; so we still need to work on <br/>\nthis issue, as it is hard to implement a rule about tv viewing if the parent <br/>\nwants it on all of the time, too.  Even if he goes outside to do something, <br/>\nhe hardly ever turns off the tv-- it is just on in an empty room!  Now that <br/>\nreally bugs me!  But, in fairness, it&#39;s always on at his parent&#39;s house, too; <br/>\nI am sure he grew up with it on constantly.  To this day, if his parents host <br/>\na holiday dinner, like Thanksgiving, all of the men sit in front of the tv <br/>\nand eat!!  Grrr!                                                                <br/>\n                          He also likes to bring the kids videos to watch.  <br/>\nAgain, I think there is a time and place for them, but I don&#39;t want the kids <br/>\nwatching movies all of the time either.  What gets hard is when I am tired, <br/>\nor having to do something, and it can be so tempting to just pop something in <br/>\nthe vcr and let the tv babysit for me, and I am guilty of this from time to <br/>\ntime, but I am trying to not do it very often!  Well, I hope you can find the <br/>\nbook at your library; it&#39;s a worthwhile read. Sorry to have gone on and on, <br/>\nbut it is really  an issue that I am concerned about.                           <br/>\n                                                            Happy reading,      <br/>\n                                                                                <br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"susan","from":"susan &lt;fxfireob@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"0xR5c1UopqjNr1C88ydqI2Xe64ZpsbXfu9RvqHtJZcy1Hb6Hcg79Qu1q8aSBv0bp5xGz3MY4DrDyDuOHotXTPtg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] looking for info","postDate":"957867139","msgId":8462,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5MTdFNDdFLkNGQkZFQkQyQGZsYXNoLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGRkLjQxMzlhZjkuMjY0OTUyZDhAY3MuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":8461,"nextInTopic":8463,"prevInTime":8461,"nextInTime":8463,"topicId":8461,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"evolutions end by joesph cliton pearce","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1738877023\">\n<html>\n<u>evolutions end</u> by joesph cliton pearce\n<p>Jaam1224@... wrote:\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote TYPE=\"CITE\">information on th effects of TV.</blockquote>\n</span></blockquote></p></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8464,"nextTopicId":8467}}
