The store manager might or might NOT be reasonable and your  <br/>\nson might be disappointed. Find something else to offer and empathize  <br/>\nwith him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe store ladder isn&#39;t yours and it isn&#39;t there for customers to  <br/>\nclimb on and you knew that. He needs YOU to let him know stuff like  <br/>\nthat. You let him do it, even though you surely must have known that  <br/>\nif the store manager saw him that he would not like it. If he REALLY  <br/>\nwanted to, you could have found the store manager and asked, &quot;We  <br/>\nREALLY want to go up that ladder in aisle 4, so I wanted to see if we  <br/>\ncould get your permission - I&#39;d stand right there and hold his hand  <br/>\nand we&#39;ll be super careful. Do you think that would be all right just  <br/>\nthis once?&quot; You never know - some managers would say okay and others  <br/>\nwould say no way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with the fire truck that somebody else wrote about - we&#39;ve had  <br/>\nfirefighters bring their trucks TO parks and put up the big tall  <br/>\nladder and actually let people go up as high as they wanted - even  <br/>\nvery young kids - 3 and 4 year olds. It was arranged in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake advantage of serendipitous opportunities and arrange cool  <br/>\nexperiences - that&#39;s all good. But you don&#39;t have some kind of  <br/>\n&quot;right&quot; to create a climbing experience for your son in a grocery  <br/>\nstore using their ladder.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the running - a kid who runs and has to be chased is not safe  <br/>\nin a store with doors that open to parking lots. You&#39;re responsible  <br/>\nfor his safety, so if you can&#39;t find a way for him to be safe, then  <br/>\ndon&#39;t take him to stores or anyplace where his running might be  <br/>\nunsafe for him or others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI get really irritated at people who aren&#39;t keeping their kids safe -  <br/>\nyesterday we saw a dad and a really young boy - maybe 4, not older,  <br/>\ncrossing the street at a very very busy large intersection with left  <br/>\nturn arrows and many lanes in each direction. The boy was on a  <br/>\nscooter and was out ahead of the dad. The dad REALLY needed to hold  <br/>\nthat kid back with him - he was so short and hard to see and a car  <br/>\nturning left came within inches of running him down. The dad then  <br/>\nYELLED at the kid to watch out. But it was the dad&#39;s responsibility  <br/>\nto have seen in advance that the child needed to have his hand held.  <br/>\nHis letting his son do something dangerous was rude to US - we had to  <br/>\nsit there and watch as he was really very nearly run down. It was  <br/>\nawful. It could have been even more awful. It is just really rude to  <br/>\nother people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t really care if that kid had an aversion to having his hand  <br/>\nheld. If he can&#39;t be kept safe, he shouldn&#39;t be out there. Same with  <br/>\na kid running and having to be chased in a store or elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnexpected things happen - I&#39;m not saying that every time a kid takes  <br/>\noff that means a parent should no longer ever take them out in  <br/>\npublic. But if you KNOW you have a child who runs and has to be  <br/>\nchased, it is irresponsible to take them places where they might get  <br/>\nhurt or hurt someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Fw: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Detoxing","postDate":"1130609564","msgId":109164,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlNC40NzY3MTg2ZS4zMDk1MTU5Y0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":109160,"nextInTopic":109165,"prevInTime":109163,"nextInTime":109165,"topicId":109149,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He always comes down when I ask now<br/>\nthough (not without protest)...I think for some kids, its just too<br/>\ntempting. Maybe if you see something like that try to distract him,<br/>\ndon&#39;t go down the aisle, maybe really get into talking about it, what<br/>\nits used for, talk to him about why he can&#39;t be on it. For me, those<br/>\nsituations kind of suck, because I feel like I&#39;m forced to enforce<br/>\nthe store&#39;s rule or get yelled at by some salesperson, when very<br/>\noften their fears are unfounded (would your son *really* get hurt by<br/>\nclimbing up a couple of steps, and then down, with you watching,<br/>\nkeeping him safe? Probably not, and yet I know I feel like I&#39;m<br/>\nletting my son do &quot;bad&quot; if I allow it.) We got yelled at (well, in a<br/>\nvery singsongy polite way)by the lady at the shoestore in the mall<br/>\nthe other day. Seamus was trying on shoes, and was running up and<br/>\ndown the (carpeted, empty,short)aisle we were in, to see if the<br/>\nshoes would fall off when he ran (they did). &quot;No running, i dont<br/>\nwant you to get hurt&quot;...i said &quot;oh he&#39;s just testing out his<br/>\nshoes&quot; &quot;I know, but i dont want him to get hurt&quot;...there was zero<br/>\nchance of him getting hurt, but yet we were still reprimanded. So i<br/>\ncan see how a kid might not fully buy into WHY he can&#39;t do<br/>\nsomething, because oftentimes there isnt a real good reason behind<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI can relate to this. Sometimes I think my kids are wild. They are the ones <br/>\nthat climb all the trees in the park and play very unconventionally on the <br/>\nplayground - and don&#39;t wear shoes ;-) Usually, they are climbing and <br/>\nplaying - and everything is a game - even in stores. There are times when I <br/>\nam good at not stressing about it - but others that I do get stressed - and <br/>\nI would say my biggest flaw in this area in inconsistency.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had an experience in Wal-Mart - where my son likes to sit/lay on that <br/>\nbottom rack of the cart(where you can put big things...such as cases of <br/>\nwater. etc. Usually, its ok - I am sure there may be kids who could get <br/>\nhurt, but we are usually very careful. We were told be the manager to have <br/>\nhim get out. We have been &quot;spoken too&quot; at Home Depot for our children <br/>\nsitting on that really big, long cart used for carrying large pieces of wood <br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say that my kids are certainly exuberant. I can take any of them <br/>\nalone and they are great - but put them all together and although I would <br/>\nnever say they were &quot;bad&quot; but they don&#39;t behave quietly all the time. Even <br/>\nat the library we go through the &quot;library voice&quot; discussion before we get in <br/>\nthere, but they have this tree play fort area in the kids section and I am <br/>\nsure that kids are meant to go up there and quietly read.
