I hope it&#39;s obvious that since I love my children and <br/>\ntry to live consciously, the welfare of my children is inherently part <br/>\nof any grander scheme.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI needed to live my own life with passion and attention and intention.  <br/>\nWhat my children needed (and this is an evolution--the balance <br/>\ncontinues to shift as they grow) was to see me actively living my life, <br/>\nguided by my own lights...and to have the freedom to do the same.  One <br/>\nside of the equation wasn&#39;t as good as attending to both.  Of course <br/>\nthey also need me to value them, to be available and involved with <br/>\nthem, and in communication with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the problems with trying to be a perfect parent was that no <br/>\nmatter what I did, something would fall by the wayside.  No matter what <br/>\nchoices I made, there would be something I could look at in hindsight <br/>\nand wonder how I might have been able to make a choice that had as many <br/>\ngood consequences and fewer bad ones.  It left me spending too much <br/>\ntime ruminating about my current choices without actually making as <br/>\nmany, and as a consequence it was harder to enjoy life in the present <br/>\nand plan for the future.  I was stuck in neutral trying to figure out <br/>\nthe harmless choice that would propel us all forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n*That* was awful modeling for my children, I see in hindsight.  ROFL.  <br/>\nDidn&#39;t say I was completely cured. :-D  It was more likely to put them <br/>\nin a very cautious mindset, trying very hard not to make their own <br/>\nmistakes, that may not actually be the best context in which to live <br/>\ntheir lives.  On the other hand, it may have been perfect in its time. <br/>\n;-) They aren&#39;t particularly screwed up, and are, in fact, magnificent <br/>\nin their own individual ways.  For now, I&#39;m focused in living the best <br/>\nlife I can because it&#39;s my responsibility.  Not my responsibility as a <br/>\nparent, but as a human being.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what we do, we will disappoint our children sometimes.  No <br/>\nmatter what we do, we will be able to look at their lives and wonder if <br/>\nwe could have spared them this or that.  I found that for me, it was <br/>\nhopeless to try to eliminate that possibility.  That mindset had me <br/>\nfocusing in small ways that often missed more important issues.  It&#39;s <br/>\nmade all the difference in the world to just get back to living the <br/>\nlife *I* need to live.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the game of life is fair at all, doing that will suit their needs <br/>\ntoo.  If it&#39;s not, trying to parent perfectly will backfire anyway.  <br/>\nInexplicably, I think both statements are true.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmbivalence isn&#39;t a bad thing for children to experience...it&#39;s part of <br/>\nlife, inevitable for thinking, feeling people.  It&#39;s important for them <br/>\nto be aware of it, to understand how to receive the gifts it carries, <br/>\nand learn to move anyway. I think what is detrimental for children, <br/>\nadults, and the world, is when ambivalence becomes a constant, <br/>\npredominant state that limits us.
