In Being America, Jedediah Purdy seems to be making a similar<br/>\npoint: Democracy, freedom, tolerance are indeed good ideas, but it<br/>\nshould concern us that sometimes they seem more honored in the breach<br/>\nthan in the observance.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nA West Virginian who was schooled at home before going on to Harvard<br/>\nUniversity and Yale Law School, Purdy made his debut as a social<br/>\ncommentator four years ago with For Common Things, a thoughtful critique<br/>\nof the chronic irony and disaffection that seem to pervade so much of<br/>\nAmerican life, undermining our ability to engage in meaningful political<br/>\ndiscourse.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing America reflects similar concerns. It invites us to examine our<br/>\nassumptions about terms like &quot;capitalism,&quot; &quot;globalism,&quot; &quot;liberalism,&quot;<br/>\n&quot;nationalism,&quot; and &quot;fundamentalism.&quot; It offers a penetrating look at<br/>\nAdam Smith, James Madison, Edmund Burke, and Alexis de Tocqueville. And<br/>\nit describes Purdy&#39;s travels all over the globe trying to get a fix on<br/>\nattitudes from Egypt to India to Indonesia. But with so much territory<br/>\nto cover, Purdy&#39;s argument becomes less focused<br/>\n<br/>\n-- and less original -- than in his earlier book.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing America is, among other things, an attempt to understand how<br/>\nAmerica is perceived in the rest of the world, particularly in Asia and<br/>\nAfrica. How is it that we are simultaneously loved and hated, seen as a<br/>\nmodel to be emulated ready and a dominating power to be attacked? Much<br/>\nof what Purdy says is not new, but bears reiteration: People who feel<br/>\noppressed by their own corrupt governments may turn their anger against<br/>\nAmerica, especially if we have supported those regimes. Resentment may<br/>\nalso be fueled by policies that cause economic hardship, as when the<br/>\nInternational Monetary Fund pressures debt-ridden countries to slash<br/>\nsocial services while protecting the investments of foreign speculators.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYet even those who resent America, Purdy believes, still have<br/>\n<br/>\na desire for the democratic values America symbolizes. In essence, he<br/>\nargues that we should do a better job of acting in accordance with our<br/>\nown ideals. But he tends to overlook the fact that people have different<br/>\nopinions as to which actions best serve those ideals. As a democracy,<br/>\nought we to support the rights, say, of a fundamentalist majority to<br/>\nimpose religious law on all its citizens, when this conflicts with other<br/>\nAmerican principles, such as minority rights and the separation of<br/>\nchurch and state?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, there&#39;s the problem that some people (Americans included) admire<br/>\nthe wrong American values. Sadly, Purdy finds, many an ambitious young<br/>\nEgyptian, Chinese, or Indonesian wants to emulate American-style<br/>\nmaterial success without embracing racial and religious tolerance,<br/>\nseparation of church and state, or other principles of liberal<br/>\ndemocracy.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile many of Purdy&#39;s general conclusions seem reasonable, when he comes<br/>\ndown to specifics, his judgments are more questionable. Looking around<br/>\nfor an example of &quot;illiberal&quot; actions by the current administration, he<br/>\nmakes no mention of its regressive economic policies, pointing instead<br/>\nto Condoleezza Rice&#39;s appeal to the networks in the wake of 9/11 to<br/>\nrefrain from broadcasting material that might endanger national<br/>\nsecurity.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nCuriously, while Purdy&#39;s previous book took issue with the assumption<br/>\nthat politics should stand aside and let the marketplace work its magic,<br/>\nin this book he seems more impressed by the power of commerce to instill<br/>\ntolerance, openness, and other humane values. In his penultimate<br/>\nchapter, Purdy muses: &quot;In a 100 years, if economic progress continues<br/>\nand population growth stabilizes&quot; (he doesn&#39;t cite any evidence for<br/>\nthese assumptions) &quot;it is imaginable that there will be...no more<br/>\ncountries where people are willing to work on nearly any terms the<br/>\nowners and bosses offer. There would still be great inequality, but the<br/>\nbalance of power would have shifted in favor of the workers.&quot; Comparing<br/>\nthe squalid condition of the 19th-century London poor with the<br/>\nprosperous London of today, he implies that if it happened in London, it<br/>\ncan happen in Calcutta.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBut he doesn&#39;t trouble to note how this change was accomplished. To<br/>\nimply that economic, social, and political progress is an automatic<br/>\nbyproduct of an &quot;evolving&quot; marketplace is to slight the tireless efforts<br/>\nof politicians, reformers, preachers, journalists, teachers, labor<br/>\nunions, sanitary commissions, social workers, enlightened employers,<br/>\nphilanthropic institutions, workman&#39;s education programs, labor and<br/>\nhealthcare legislation.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nA laudable attempt to provide Americans with a sense of direction in a<br/>\nbewildering era, Being America is nonetheless a book that&#39;s all over the<br/>\nplace in more ways than one.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMerle Rubin reviews books for the Monitor and The Wall Street<br/>\nJournal....<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRead the entire review at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.powells.com/csm/review/2003_03_31\">http://www.powells.com/csm/review/2003_03_31</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nCOPIES NOW AVAILABLE*<br/>\n<br/>\nHardcover (New) $24.00<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.powells.com/csm/cgi-bin/product?isbn=0375413073\">http://www.powells.com/csm/cgi-bin/product?isbn=0375413073</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n*Please note that copies are limited to on-hand quantity; used copies,<br/>\nin particular, may be available in extremely limited supply.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBrowse reviews from the past five days:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.powells.com/csm/review\">http://www.powells.com/csm/review</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit Christian Science Monitor at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/\">http://www.csmonitor.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are currently subscribed to review-a-day as: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jwwjr@...\">jwwjr@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE from Review-a-Day, go to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/list_manager\">http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/list_manager</a><br/>\n<br/>\nor send an email with the word &quot;REMOVE&quot; in the subject to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leave-review-a-day-541845G@...\">leave-review-a-day-541845G@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTO CHANGE THE ADDRESS where you receive this newsletter, go to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/list_manager\">http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/list_manager</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTO SUBSCRIBE to Review-a-Day, go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.powells.com/review\">http://www.powells.com/review</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.powells.com\">http://www.powells.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.powells.com/\">http://www.powells.com/</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nFree North American shipping on orders over $50.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62535,"nextTopicId":62405}}
