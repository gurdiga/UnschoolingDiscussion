I love breastfeeding, did so easily and my children all nursed till<br/>\nat least two years of age and I am heartily sick of breastfeeding fanatics<br/>\nmaking other women who have valid and personal reasons for the choices they<br/>\nmake, feel inferior, ignorant and/or lazy!!<br/>\nWhat a luxury it is to be able to choose how to nourish our children when<br/>\nmillions of women throughout the world are watching helpless as their<br/>\nbeloved children starve to death! God, the pettiness of this flaming<br/>\n&quot;discussion&quot; is mind-boggling! May I respectfully suggest that some of these<br/>\nbreastfeeding zealots spend their time and energy (they obviously have<br/>\nplenty of both) to campaign to force the US Govt to label all baby formula<br/>\nsold in the Third World with the logo &quot;breastfeeding is best&quot; as many women,<br/>\nin the Third world are feeding their babies improperly prepared formula ie.<br/>\nusing dirty, polluted water under the misapprehension that this is far<br/>\nSUPERIOR to breastmilk. How come &quot;informed choice&quot; only applies to people<br/>\nwho vote for the legislators in the US???<br/>\nAgain, thanks Kim for your two cents worth of compassion and clarity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nBrooke</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7830,"nextTopicId":7835}}
