Some<br/>\ntruant students were getting out of being punished by claiming they were<br/>\nbeing home-schooled, Vigil said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The problem is that we have very lenient home-school laws, and we have no<br/>\nway of preventing anyone from going to home-schools,&quot; he said. &quot;I wanted to<br/>\nclose that loophole and discourage them from going to home-school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow awful and prejudiced!<br/>\nCould this be the reason some people who homeschool are afraid to go out<br/>\nduring school hours where I live? Nosey brainwashed people like to report<br/>\nkids as being truant. I think it must be very hard on hs teens if they have<br/>\nto be treated so badly by others! It is like a witch hunt isn&#39;t it even if<br/>\nthose kids were lying and not being hschooled they obviously were doing no<br/>\nharm and maybe even helping the economy. This worries me also as a<br/>\nregistered democrat that they (democrats) are too school happy. I am glad to<br/>\nhear that Coloradans defeated this bill. What can I do to stop this<br/>\ninsanity? Did someone mention something about lobbying here for more rights?<br/>\nBeth</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sandi Chelan","from":"&quot;Sandi Chelan&quot; &lt;SChelan@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"yQerlcLERiD2JZhrgAQpzVULpjH2nTxaLtiHDngBO3frxKNgl22kv4A6GdeuRbHEg7_ECPwq1zlq7ax8wax1T-dtpl8tg3sE5Vyoijc","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Colorado HB1335 defeated","postDate":"950025747","msgId":6298,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40MDguNjI5OC45NTkyNjk3NDZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6299,"prevInTime":6297,"nextInTime":6299,"topicId":6298,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://www.gazette.com/daily/loc13.html Bill to regulate home schools dies with help from parents By Jennifer Hamilton/The Gazette DENVER - About 150","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1321890534\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gazette.com/daily/loc13.html\">http://www.gazette.com/daily/loc13.html</a><br/>\nBill to regulate home schools dies with help from parents<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Jennifer Hamilton/The Gazette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDENVER - About 150 home-school parents and children learned a lesson in<br/>\ngovernment Monday as they helped defeat an attempt to put more government<br/>\ncontrols on home-schooling.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6289,"nextTopicId":6243}}
