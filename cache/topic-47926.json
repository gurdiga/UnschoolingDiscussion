When the<br/>\nparent decides to choose the wrong route they place a burden on the child<br/>\ninstead of empowering the child.  The child must know seek the loving path.  I<br/>\nbelieve in responsibility for actions.  I made a conscious choice before my<br/>\nson was born to be a non-spanking, loving parent (I only know 1 other black<br/>\nmother who doesn&#39;t spank, my sister).  I have other issues I&#39;m working on<br/>\nfreeing myself of, but I am aware of them.  I think conscious (right) choice<br/>\nis the key to being a loving parent.  I feel fortunate that I&#39;ve met a few in<br/>\nreal-life and plenty on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think evil is a part of this world because there are still people who choose<br/>\nto practice it and who choose not to learn from the evil that was practiced on<br/>\nthem.
