The only problems it had was that it needed a new motor<br/>\nfor the beater brush (too many long cords getting vaccumed up over the<br/>\nyears) and it needed some new wheels (from being dropped and beat up by my<br/>\ndh) and a new switch (after I smashed the hooey out of it in a fit of<br/>\ndepression-induced rage).  It has tolerated a lot of abuse.  It&#39;s only<br/>\ndrawback is that it is heavy and kind of unwieldy in small spaces (our last<br/>\nhouse was 720 sq ft).  But it does a great job!
