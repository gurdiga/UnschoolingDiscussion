I watch occasionally late at night and am always<br/>\ndissapointed in the &quot;journalism&quot;.  Dh and I have always been newspaper<br/>\nreaders, NPR fans and now, we often google a news subject that catches our<br/>\nattention.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids haven&#39;t seen much news, they typically ask to change the channel or<br/>\nturn it off if it comes on.  Once my dd then 7yo saw some coverage of a<br/>\nkidnapping while she was sleeping over atr afriends house.  She had<br/>\nnightmares and wouldn&#39;t go into her bedroom alone for weeks.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve my friend let them watch it.  When I asked what she was thinking she<br/>\nsaid &quot;oh it was just on.&quot; I was so mad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginal message:<br/>\n   Date: Mon, 03 Nov 2003 12:14:44 -0800<br/>\n   From: Tia Leschke &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Questions?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I stopped watching most TV news when my first child was a toddler, because<br/>\n&gt;I didn&#39;t want her to be exposed to it.
