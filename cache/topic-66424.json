When he was drinking he would <br/>\n  sometimes use the buckle end unknowingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One night he made me sit on the potty for hours on end. He would keep coming <br/>\n  in and asking me if I went yet. Mom who at the time was working nights came <br/>\n  home at 2am to me still there dazed. She tells me I was out of it in her <br/>\n  words.<br/>\n  I eventually just stopped pooping. After a couple months I finally got sick <br/>\n  enough and they noticed I hadn&#39;t gone.  I was in Boston Children&#39;s Hospital <br/>\n  for two weeks at seven and once at ten. The second for dehydration I have no <br/>\n  idea why?<br/>\n<br/>\n  My Parents got divorced and all was good until I was 12 and I ended up living <br/>\n  with him because my Mother remarried, had another child and we (my sister and <br/>\n  I) where old news. The last day my Father touched me was when I was running <br/>\n  out of his house after he had tried to strangle me, picked me up by my hair <br/>\n  and pulled a good clump out. My father and Step mother where both running <br/>\n  after me but I ran out the door to a neighbor.<br/>\n  I am now 32 with three of my own. My sister with four. We both broke the <br/>\n  cycle in our family by being there for each other.<br/>\n  My parents where good people otherwise. My dad knows now the damage he did. I <br/>\n  am fine now but I dont recall any of my child hood I blocked most of it out. <br/>\n  I can only recall pieces when I look at photo&#39;s or when I am in conversation <br/>\n  with them and they say you don&#39;t remember this and that? Ahh, no I dont. <br/>\n  We have friends that are religious (Their church advocates this) who spank <br/>\n  and for stupid things. Why do people hit their kids to get them to stop <br/>\n  hitting what&#39;s up with that!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorry for the depressing story, someday I will find my way to help others to <br/>\n  stop damaging their children. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Laura<br/>\n  Maine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Every time I pooped I was sent to my room and told to pull my pants","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-341687063\">Spank Out Day!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was spanked/whiped with a belt when I was little for pooping my pants.  <br/>\nEvery time I pooped I was sent to my room and told to pull my pants down and <br/>\nmy Dad came in a hut me with his belt. When he was drinking he would <br/>\nsometimes use the buckle end unknowingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne night he made me sit on the potty for hours on end. He would keep coming <br/>\nin and asking me if I went yet. Mom who at the time was working nights came <br/>\nhome at 2am to me still there dazed. She tells me I was out of it in her <br/>\nwords.<br/>\nI eventually just stopped pooping. After a couple months I finally got sick <br/>\nenough and they noticed I hadn&#39;t gone.  I was in Boston Children&#39;s Hospital <br/>\nfor two weeks at seven and once at ten. The second for dehydration I have no <br/>\nidea why?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Parents got divorced and all was good until I was 12 and I ended up living <br/>\nwith him because my Mother remarried, had another child and we (my sister and <br/>\nI) where old news. The last day my Father touched me was when I was running <br/>\nout of his house after he had tried to strangle me, picked me up by my hair <br/>\nand pulled a good clump out. My father and Step mother where both running <br/>\nafter me but I ran out the door to a neighbor.<br/>\nI am now 32 with three of my own. My sister with four. We both broke the <br/>\ncycle in our family by being there for each other.<br/>\nMy parents where good people otherwise. My dad knows now the damage he did. I <br/>\nam fine now but I dont recall any of my child hood I blocked most of it out. <br/>\nI can only recall pieces when I look at photo&#39;s or when I am in conversation <br/>\nwith them and they say you don&#39;t remember this and that? Ahh, no I dont. <br/>\nWe have friends that are religious (Their church advocates this) who spank <br/>\nand for stupid things. Why do people hit their kids to get them to stop <br/>\nhitting what&#39;s up with that!<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the depressing story, someday I will find my way to help others to <br/>\nstop damaging their children. <br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\nMaine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66706,"nextTopicId":66720}}
