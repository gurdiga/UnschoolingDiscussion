And when one side is the dominating voice in a group, <br/>\nthe other side feels stifled.  I can understand that, having been on <br/>\nboth sides philosophically.  The dominating side wants to keep their <br/>\nvoice and ideas, from being overtaken, by what they percieve to <br/>\nbe, &quot;not right&quot;, or not the ideal in their eyes.  <br/>\nI&#39;m not referring to one side here, I see it from both.<br/>\nI checked around on the Yahoo groups and saw groups that are more <br/>\nrelaxed about unschooling and what it is, to those who are pretty <br/>\ndefinitive about what unschooling is. <br/>\nThose groups can exist peacefully, if there is an idea of what the <br/>\nmajority wants; a general consensus of what kinds of discussions that <br/>\nthe group is suited for.  And unfortunatley, that seems to come in <br/>\none form or the other.  <br/>\nSo, what to do with this board?<br/>\nIt seems that each &quot;camp&quot;(and I don&#39;t like that ideas, but there it <br/>\nis...) has found their own places, and are having discussions that <br/>\nare meeting their needs.<br/>\nNoone seems to be posting much here, because, it seems to me, there <br/>\nis no feeling of what it is about anymore.  And there are other <br/>\nplaces that make it clear, what they are about.<br/>\nHow can that be fixed?  Should it be fixed?<br/>\nMaybe it will all blow over, and rebuild itself naturally.  <br/>\nBut, I can pretty much bet, if it does, there will be a dominating <br/>\nvoice, and challenges of that will happen, and the circle will begin <br/>\nagain.<br/>\nJoanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;rumpleteasermom&quot; <br/>\n&lt;rumpleteasermom@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think the goal is to figure out who is to blame and who <br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; blame, but to figure out how to stop the sparks from causing an <br/>\n&gt; eruption<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *before* it creates something that someone is embarrassed to have <br/>\n&gt; been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; accused of starting.
