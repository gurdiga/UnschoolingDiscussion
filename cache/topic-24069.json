From this <br/>\nthey are comfortable with their instincts as to whether people are &quot;safe&quot; or <br/>\nnot.

The last 4 weeks have been very hard for us...first we moved her into an assisted living facility at her request.  She loves it there (has her own apt, great food in lovely dining room, lots of new friends and things to do, no cooking or cleaning etc).  Two weeks ago she fell and broke several ribs and has been in the hospital since.  She is being moved to a nursing home tomorrow for aprx 2 weeks until she gets her strength back and to do extra therapy.  My kids go with me almost every day.  They even went into ICU for a moment even though they weren&#39;t allowed (I couldn&#39;t wait any longer for info and could not leave them in the visitors area).  They do moan and groan sometimes when we are going but I think that is mostly because the drive to her is about and hour and a half, so it ruins our day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s great that you expose your kids to old folks.  They are all so different, they all age differently.  And they do have a great deal to offer, if asked.  My 4yo is still quite a shy child with strangers but will give out hugs quite often because she understands how old folks rarely get to see or hug a beautiful child, and it makes them feel good.<br/>\n<br/>\nA recommendation for reading, depending on the ages of your children; Five O&#39;Clock Charlie by Margaurite Henry.  We have an old illustrated copy that both my 4 yog and 9yob love to hear.  Charlie is put out to pasture and doesn&#39;t feel useful anymore, but finds a way to be useful and loved.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn trying to decide where to go for visits, keep in mind that both your children and the elderly they are visiting will get so much more out of visits if they are one-on-one.  Give the old person and the child time to actually talk to one another and make a connection.  Maybe teach each other things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and great job!<br/>\nCindy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bronwen","from":"&quot;Bronwen&quot; &lt;felesina@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"p3SDlO5VAvXdb6MuymDswWDCUfElH8G2AB8DaUIIE0HvQZHzqx_cJh4DyfqFXV3pHhb0ea9A3yR1XPILrJeCdywBr1sX","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] elderly - was volunteer work","postDate":"999502039","msgId":24082,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTAwMWMxMzQ0OSRlMTMwOTkwMCRhZTcwZDFkMUB1c2VyPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE0Yy42MzM0MjYuMjhjNTI3MjJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24080,"nextInTopic":24087,"prevInTime":24081,"nextInTime":24083,"topicId":24069,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... apartments and all oh yeah!

They are both very sensitive people and the smell, coupled with senile old folks yelling gibberish, being wheeled around in wheel chairs with air breathing canisters etc.  I fear, painted a very bleak picture of growing old.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was MY idea mind you- &quot;so they can have some interaction with old people, help the community...&quot;  ANYWAY- &quot;helping&quot; is a good idea- a really good one if *they* think of how they want to &quot;help&quot;.  The best, me thinks, is to model volunteering myself- not because I want to &quot;get my kids to help society&quot; but because I really have the time, energy, capacity and desire to do so.  Seems like people who have been writing about their successful volunteering are really enjoying it together- (socializing the kitties!- so sweet- and necessary!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I guess what I am trying to say is (in my experience, anyway) that maybe going to the old folks home is sort of a &quot;touchy&quot; thing...and it would be best done as an outgrowth of an interest someone really has- not so much &#39;cause a mom thinks it would be good.   <br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I would mention that.<br/>\n<br/>\nbronwen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24003,"nextTopicId":23994}}
