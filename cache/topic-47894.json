Maybe its because before unschooling I wasn&#39;t always there for her, was trying to do everything else.   We are relatively new to this.  Just 6 months for total unschooling living.  Maybe I&#39;m being unrealistic that I think they&#39;ll be just &#39;fine&#39; already.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m sure some of this has been covered before but I just really need some reassurance and suggestions right now,  &lt;sad&gt;I really had a bad night with her last night. &lt;very sad&gt;<br/>\nKelli<br/>\n &quot;Todd M.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Ozarkren@...\">Ozarkren@...</a>&gt; wrote:At 11:24 PM 10/24/02 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Do you think the one-on-one or small playgroup is critically important, or <br/>\n&gt;are group<br/>\n&gt;activities like library storytime, etc, enough?

I think we are going to try <br/>\nto find some older playmates for Kalie, and, with luck, some with the same <br/>\nparenting attitudes we have. I&#39;m also going to try to help her interact a <br/>\nlittle more easily, if that seems to be her desire, and shorten up playdates <br/>\na little/lot depending what&#39;s needed to keep her excitement/frustration from <br/>\nbuilding to a point that&#39;s not manageable for her right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a (another) question - are there any other parents of young &#39;only <br/>\nchildren&#39; who might be willing to share how much interaction with other <br/>\nchildren they seek/arrange access to for their child? Do you think the <br/>\none-on-one or small playgroup is critically important, or are group <br/>\nactivities like library storytime, etc, enough?

Sorry, I must <br/>\nhave missed that. And I think Joyce made the remark that maybe she want&#39;s to <br/>\ninteract but doesn&#39;t know how to go about it. Also when you said that the <br/>\nkids aren&#39;t quite as vocal and such as she is, maybe she does want to play <br/>\nbut just doesn&#39;t get the kind of response she&#39;s looking for. That mixed with <br/>\nboredom, again from not getting what she wants can add up to just kicking <br/>\nsomeone out of frustration of it all. I can understand that. Maybe trying <br/>\nsome older kids would help.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Sierra happens to get along great with kids her age and older kids too <br/>\nbut just loves ones a bit younger than her. She has this mother thing she <br/>\ndoes and plays really well with 4 and 5 year olds. My son and youngest <br/>\nhappen to like older kids more so but still get along great with kids the <br/>\nsame age or younger. It just seems like a preference they have right now.<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you&#39;ll figure it out in no time with all the great advice flying <br/>\naround here.<br/>\nLet us know how it goes.<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13833,"nextTopicId":48339}}
