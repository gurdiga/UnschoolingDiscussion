A month&#39;s groceries, an overnight trip to Lagoon, a family pool <br/>\nseason pass and money to spend on the concession there...aaargh!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what we&#39;re doing right now: <br/>\n<br/>\nHistory: she has read through her whole history book, for pleasure. <br/>\nIn order to learn how to study for a test, (since she wants to go to <br/>\ncollege), I taught her how to go through her reading and find the <br/>\nmain points, and then she has an open book test. I&#39;ve also told her, <br/>\ncollege tests won&#39;t be open book, and she knows she should hone her <br/>\nstudy skills to prepare for college.<br/>\n<br/>\nScience: read a chapter, take an open book test. Forget everything <br/>\nexcept the bits about the ocean (an interest of Abbie&#39;s)<br/>\n<br/>\nGrammar: sit down with mom, and get into a fit of giggles at how <br/>\nSTUPID and USELESS it is to have to show someone else that she can <br/>\nfill in the little dots, and take an open book test with lots of <br/>\nguessing.<br/>\n<br/>\nEconomics: sit down with the book and mom, and read through the book <br/>\ntogether, and talk about tools, consuming, food, shelter, and work. <br/>\nLaugh a lot. Talk about it on the way to drama class. Haven&#39;t taken a <br/>\ntest in that one yet. Open book, most likely.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMath: we&#39;re ignoring math. She knows how to do everything up to <br/>\ndividing and multiplying fractions. She went so far in math, and <br/>\nsaid &quot;no more!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nand, she is doing this at her own pace. She rattled off about 10 <br/>\nscience tests in one week, and is now leaving it all alone. <br/>\n<br/>\nwe may continue along those lines, just to &quot;finish what we started&quot; <br/>\n(if that isn&#39;t an unschooling attitude, remember: I&#39;m a work in <br/>\nprogress here! L) and to give mom and dad the feeling that we didn&#39;t <br/>\nshell out $400 for her not to finish. She does have until Oct. 31 to <br/>\nfinish the year out. (they give a pupil a whole year to do one year&#39;s <br/>\nwork, and we got started with this in Oct.) <br/>\n<br/>\nand HAVE WE learned our lesson! Abbie, too, though.
