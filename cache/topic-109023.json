BOOOORING.   It feels <br/>\npointless and if I&#39;m with others it makes me feel out of control.   I feel <br/>\nvulnerable to being hurt or it raining or something like that and not  being able <br/>\nto get back except via my own two feet.  These are the same  reasons I had <br/>\ntrouble on group runs in the Army, too.  Physically I could  do it.  <br/>\nPsychologically, not knowing where I&#39;m going and when it would end  was VERY hard.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut I LOVE to walk in the woods and ride my bike all around my  neighborhood <br/>\nand wherever else I can ride it. I LOVE to walk my dogs in the  neighborhood.  <br/>\nI can walk to the park or the store.  But just to  walk around the <br/>\nneighborhood, nah.  <br/>\n <br/>\nJust walking is boring.  Doing something while walking, or doing it  for a <br/>\npurpose is not.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109008,"nextTopicId":109028}}
