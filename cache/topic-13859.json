It was six months to the DAY<br/>\n(!) that we de-schooled and I was in a panic. If it hadn&#39;t been for my best<br/>\nfriend trying this radical thing called UNschooling alongside me, I would&#39;ve<br/>\ngiven in. Some of the things you mentioned made bells ring in my head and<br/>\nI&#39;m going to throw them out there for consideration. I&#39;m sure we&#39; ve read<br/>\nthe same books... Teenage Liberation Handbook, Real Lives, John HOlt<br/>\nstuff...<br/>\n<br/>\nI got the feeling from reading your post that you are still giving your dd<br/>\nthe impression that *you* hold the strings and yet you don&#39;t realize you&#39;re<br/>\ndoing it. By purchasing all these goodies (I can&#39;t blame you... I did it<br/>\ntoo), she still senses your control. And she still sits. Now, I don&#39;t think<br/>\nyou can blame her... she&#39;s just doing what comes naturally.  But as long as<br/>\nshe feels like these things are around for her to do, *she&#39;s* not in control<br/>\n(in her mind, anyway).<br/>\nExample: When we took Katie out of kindergarten years ago, I did the school<br/>\nat home thing, too... complete with blackboard, desk, textbooks<br/>\n:-P It was a fight daily and Katie grew to HATE to read. HATE to... and<br/>\nstill doesn&#39;t choose to read for pleasure but only for information.  Anyway,<br/>\nwhen I began the unschooling thing around 3rd grade with her, that six<br/>\nmonths was the longest time of my life. Several times I wanted to shake her<br/>\nand say, &quot;wake up!! READ THIS GOOD BOOK!&quot;  But I refrained, thanks to my<br/>\nfriend Lili, who shared this venture with me. ( I often returned the favor,<br/>\nBTW). So, at that six month point, Katie came to me one day  and said,<br/>\n&quot;remember that Miquan Math we used to do?&quot;<br/>\nYes, I said.<br/>\n&quot;well,&quot; says she, &quot;where is it?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Look on my closet shelf, behind the blah blah blah.&quot;<br/>\nShe went to my closet, got the Miquan and returned to her room closing the<br/>\ndoor behind her. Frantically and happily, I called Lili and told her of the<br/>\nevents :-). I said to Lili, &quot;well, I gotta get off the phone and go help<br/>\nKatie with this math stuff&quot; only to have Lili shout in my ear, &quot;OH NO YOU<br/>\nDON&quot;T!!!! You&#39;ll undo all the de-schooling we&#39;ve been through!&quot; Lili was<br/>\nright. If I had gone to Katie, I would&#39;ve been taking ownership of it again.<br/>\nI know... I know... you&#39;re thinking this is ridiculous. But I don&#39;t think so<br/>\nfrom a child&#39;s perspective, anyway.<br/>\nSo, I stayed away... sucked on the stub of MY tongue &lt;g&gt; and during that<br/>\nfirst &quot;unschooled&quot; day, she went through 20-some pages of Miquan all by<br/>\nherself.  When she had a question, she&#39;d come to me, I&#39;d answer *just* the<br/>\nquestion and nothing more. It&#39;s been like this ever since.  It took time for<br/>\nme to adapt to her method of madness.... one subject, intently, for a while<br/>\nthen off to something completely different.  Then back again...There were<br/>\nalso lulls of a few weeks where she would not do anything I considered<br/>\neducational but since she&#39;s now focused on medicine, she&#39;s stopped doing<br/>\nthat.<br/>\nIt just sounds to me like you&#39;re at that same point... where you have to let<br/>\nher *completely* take ownership of her education and her goals in life.  So,<br/>\ngo grab another cup of coffee, *another* good book (try Punished by Rewards<br/>\nby Alfie Kohn) and kick back. It&#39;ll happen.<br/>\nSarah</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13863,"nextTopicId":13884}}
