I did when I was a kid, but I didn&#39;t become a witch, lol.  Superheros have powers too, is that the same thing?  Maybe you&#39;re overly sensitive to witchcraft in general?  I kinda like the way that the Sabrina show points out that even though they have witchcraft powers, they still get themselves in spots where their powers can&#39;t help much.  They still have to think their way out of situations.  Powers aren&#39;t everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyle<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Ren &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Mon, 19 Jan 2004 16:59:38 GMT<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Witchcraft type play<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; as was my bigger worry...&quot;witchcraft&quot; type play from<br/>\n&gt;  some of the shows Sarah likes to watch. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why?
