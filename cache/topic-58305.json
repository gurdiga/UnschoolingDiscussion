A<br/>\n  composer plans the harmony, writing for a transposing instrument merely<br/>\n  means that before you hand the player the part, it has to read right to them<br/>\n  to play what you had in mind.

Therefore, when an alto sax player is reading music <br/>\nwritten for a C instrument, she has to transpose it up (I think) a minor <br/>\nthird in order to play the same pitches that are written down.  Does that <br/>\nexplain it?  That&#39;s my best shot.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to working/lurking.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] math and music","postDate":"1044745204","msgId":58305,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNkI0OEIyLjFERjMlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNDQ3NDI4MjYuMTYyMi41MjQ3My5tNUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":58309,"prevInTime":58304,"nextInTime":58306,"topicId":58305,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;ll look it up, but if you feel like it, I&#39;d be glad<br/>\n&gt; to hear more about it.  Given your example of a violin, I assume that is<br/>\n&gt; considered a &quot;transposing instrument&quot;.  I&#39;ve never heard it called that.

A<br/>\ncomposer plans the harmony, writing for a transposing instrument merely<br/>\nmeans that before you hand the player the part, it has to read right to them<br/>\nto play what you had in mind.  In short, the other way around.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not good at transposition.  (I memorized it for a theory test a long<br/>\ntime ago, and promptly forgot it....), but there used to be a french horn<br/>\nplayer around here someplace.  Maybe she could explain it to you....<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59028,"nextTopicId":59217}}
