But I think the issue<br/>\nbecomes one of degree or perhaps balance.  It is one thing to play shooting<br/>\ngames, it is another to be obsessed with violence.  If someone, adult or<br/>\nchild, is holed up in their room for days on end playing gory games,<br/>\nlistening to rape and pillage music......that is just so much different than<br/>\nan adult or child who has many interests one of which is gory games or rape<br/>\nand pillage music.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son, 10yo, loves guns, adores guns.  Used to go to the library and check<br/>\nout &quot;The Shooter&#39;s Bible&quot; which is basically a gun catalog and just sit and<br/>\nlook through it for hours on end.  We were a bit worried because he seemed<br/>\nso obsessed with little sense of what being shot does to a real life person.<br/>\nSo we signed him up for skeet shooting through 4-H.  We helped him channel<br/>\nthat in a socially acceptable manner.  He still loves guns but his talk<br/>\nabout them has matured tremendously and we know that he knows how to handle<br/>\none safely.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter, 13yo, listens to music that I find tremendously offensive.  We<br/>\nhave a deal that she doesn&#39;t listen to it around the little kids.  I talked<br/>\nto her about my reasons and she accepted them.  Without my ever asking her<br/>\nto, she has always changed the radio station in the car when a song was<br/>\ncoming on that she knew would be offensive to me.  She is able to judge how<br/>\nthings affect others.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrossedd@...\">jrossedd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 04, 2003 10:55 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] I can do guns, it&#39;s the gore...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 12/04/2003 10:49:22 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=-The shooting and killing used to bother me and maybe still does a bit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s really the gore that bothers me the most especially for dc<br/>\nso<br/>\n&gt; &gt; young.-=-<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s not shooting and it&#39;s not killing, and it&#39;s not gore.
