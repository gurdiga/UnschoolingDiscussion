There are kids in<br/>\nour homeschooling group who go by other names that they&#39;ve chosen.<br/>\nAs far as what my kids call me, they sometimes use my first name, which is<br/>\nfine by me. I don&#39;t stand on formality though it can freak the grandparents<br/>\nout who are a bit more traditional. The kids usually call me &quot;mom&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;momma&quot; though.
