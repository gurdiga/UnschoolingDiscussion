This came from The <br/>\nDiabetic/Hypoglycemic Cope Book:  As a woman over 19 yrs of age, who is <br/>\nnursing a baby, you will need  65g of protein a day.  It  says, further, in  <br/>\nfiguring your amounts, that if you eat  vegetable protein sources, to  <br/>\nmultiply by 0.73 before adding them to the protein total.  Ex:  tofu- 3 1/2 <br/>\noz= 8g x 0.73= 5.8g protein.                                                    <br/>\n                                Sources of protein:                             <br/>\n                                                        Dairy: cottage <br/>\ncheese- 3.5 oz= 17g    Milk solids- 1 oz=10g   milk- 1c= 9g  parmesan <br/>\ncheese-1 oz= 10g    plain yogurt- 1c= 8g   cheddar cheese- 1 oz=7g   swiss <br/>\ncheese-1 oz= 8g              Meats: (3.5 oz serving sz)...    turkey- 31g   <br/>\npork- 29g   lean steak-25g   hamburger-25g   chicken-23g   lamb-20g   1 egg- <br/>\n6g                  Grains, 1/3 cup, raw:   wheat-8g   barley-6g    millet-6g <br/>\n  oatmeal-4g   rice-5g   1 slice, whole wheat bread- 2.4g         Legumes, 1 <br/>\ncup cooked:  soy- 17g   peas- 12g   limas-10g   tofu- 8g   soymilk-9g   * <br/>\nHaving LBS will present some restrictions, initially, on your being able to <br/>\nsuccessfully consume some carbohydrates.  When first trying to stabilize <br/>\nblood sugar, it is advisable to eat a high protein diet ( Ed Krimmel, The Low <br/>\nBlood Sugar Handbook).  It takes at least 3 mos of diet modification to <br/>\nstabilize blood sugars.  In this period, you will go through withdrawal- like <br/>\nsymptoms.  You may have days where you feel worse, or even constantly hungry. <br/>\n These will pass.  As a nursing mother, you must take care to nourish your <br/>\nbody.  The baby will get what he needs from you, but being that it is a <br/>\ndirect physical drain on your system, it WILL have a direct  impact on your <br/>\ndietary needs.  This , in conjunction with LBS, means you do have special <br/>\nneeds at this time.  Over time, your need for higher protein will likely <br/>\nchange, and you will need less, but at this time-- as a nursing mother, AND a <br/>\nhypoglycemic  that is trying to get blood sugar levels in check, you do need <br/>\na higher protein  amount daily.  Listen to your body.  Eat something every <br/>\n2hrs--sooner if you need to.                                                    <br/>\n                                        Calcium requirements:  As a woman <br/>\nover 18 yrs that is nursing a baby, you need 2000mg a day.  This also came <br/>\nfrom the book mentioned above.  I do not recall the exact amts of the foods <br/>\nthat equal the mgs that correspond.  I am thinking it may be about  1 c, <br/>\nunless otherwise stated:     soymilk- 55mg   broccoli- cooked- 136mg    <br/>\ncooked carrots- 51 mg   shrimp- 63mg   raw peanuts- (1 oz )- 13 mg   1/4 lb <br/>\nlean ground beef- 14 mg   1/4 chicken -7 mg   1 egg- 27 mg     cheddar <br/>\ncheese- 200 mg   mozzarella cheese- 163 mg   parmesan cheese- 329 mg   <br/>\nricotta cheese- 1 c - 291mg   yogurt - 1 c- 274mg                               <br/>\n                                                            There are some <br/>\nfruits and vegetables that you should avoid as a hypoglycemic.  That is <br/>\nbecause they have natural sugar levels that will cause the pancreas to <br/>\nrelease too much insulin, and cause hypoglycemic symptoms.   At this time, I <br/>\ncannot eat corn, potatoes and rice (even brown rice), because they are too <br/>\nhigh glycemic.  I can eat very little bread, even though they are whole <br/>\nwheat, oat, etc.  I can have some bread items now, but I have to watch the <br/>\namts.  I make oat pancakes sometimes, which are wonderful, but I have to <br/>\nwatch the total amt of carbs throughout the day, or I will feel it for <br/>\nsometimes up to 3 days later.  Instead regular breads, I use whole flour soft <br/>\nburrito shells.  They can be used in many ways, and give you the satisfaction <br/>\nof bread, and yet, it is low glycemic.  Do not eat the corn flour shells, <br/>\nthough, until you are stabilized.    Basically, when it comes to eating <br/>\ncarbs, you will need to know which are &quot;ok&quot; and which are not.  Some you can <br/>\neat w/o limitation, and some you will need to avoid completely.  But until <br/>\nyou reach a  more stabilized blood sugar level, you should NOT eat a ton of <br/>\ncarbs just yet.  But, again, like I said before, your needs will not always <br/>\nbe like this.  I will be happy to share with you the list of carbs by % amts <br/>\nas to what is recommended  for you at this time in your dietary needs.  In no <br/>\nway do I mean to drone on and on, but I, too, am a nursing mom, who is <br/>\nhypoglycemic, and I absolutely know where you are coming from regarding the <br/>\nmood swings, and other physical symptoms.  Gotta go now... time for a snack!  <br/>\n:)  ~Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11094,"nextTopicId":11097}}
