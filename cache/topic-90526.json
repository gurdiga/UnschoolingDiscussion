However, I also like the fact that he&#39;s gaining some independance right now.  There were days for a while where he would say &quot;I can&#39;t do it&quot; to everything.  Now I&#39;m seeing more and more of an &quot;I can do it&quot; attitude and I&#39;m so proud of him.  He still likes the help of his big brother and sister, but he likes to help them, now, as well :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, February 08, 2004 2:02 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Very happy news!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 2/8/04 11:29:46 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HLSelden@...\">HLSelden@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; Morgan and Madison try to help him with everything.

We were getting ready to go to Jacksonville to go bowling with some friends of ours.  Our children have been friends since they were little.  Their mother and I used to swap sitting duty so that the other could get out.  With three kids, when you find that person that really &quot;gets it&quot; and wants to help out as much as they want to be helped...well, a great friendship has blossomed over the years.  We&#39;ve always found that adding her 3 to my 3 actually made things easier, as they paired off and enjoyed each other&#39;s company so much that we found ourselves saying &quot;Don&#39;t we have kids????&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have never been bowling and were excited all morning.  They were up at the crack of dawn and asking all sorts of questions.  My daughter, Morgan, said &quot;Mom, I didn&#39;t finish all that work my teacher sent home.  Does that mean I can&#39;t go???&quot;  She was near tears.  I hugged her and said &quot;Of course it doesn&#39;t mean that.  This is a day for the family, and it wouldn&#39;t be a family outing with you missing!!!&quot;.  She left the room smiling and I closed the door and looked at my husband.  I said &quot;If I convince her that WE can go to Silver Springs as a family..and that a fieldtrip with her class isn&#39;t worth what she&#39;s going through...can I please get her out of there?&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why I expected this to be a big discussion.  I expected him to be unsure, or just say no, or question my abilities...or something.  His response?  &quot;Sure!&quot;, with a big smile.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMorgan has always done well in school.  Her teachers and other staff have always loved her.  They nickname her &quot;smiley&quot; everywhere she goes.  She&#39;s always smiling.  Third grade brought about a big change.  Her teacher is telling me all the time how she&#39;s &quot;daydreaming&quot; and just not getting her classwork done.  They have this program called AR Reading wherein you read a book and take a computer test on it.  You gain points depending on the level of the book.  She reads like a little fiend, but never ends up with enough time in the class to take the tests.  She spends 4 hours a night on math homework.  It&#39;s insane.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we pulled her into the bedroom and I laid it out for her.  I told her that Silver Springs was a place we could go on our own, and was it really worth the stress she&#39;s been feeling?  She said no.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started this with Madison, I thought there was no way I could take on all three of my kids at once.  I thought &quot;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing...I&#39;d mess them all up for life&quot;...It only took a few short weeks for me to realize that it wasn&#39;t me who was in danger of screwing them up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMorgan&#39;s a dreamer.  I, too, suffered from daydreams.  Oh heaven forbid a child has big hopes for what they want to be, or do, or experience in life.  According to the schools, it&#39;s the biggest sin of all time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not embracing unschooling, it&#39;s embracing me.  It fits our family so well.  It really suits my children.  You can tell just by the look on their little faces.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we went bowling and had a great day.  We had a total of 9 kids with us.  They were all totally supportive of each other and I couldn&#39;t stop mentioning to my husband how proud I was.  Not just of our kids, but of their friends.  They had a blast.  No arguments about who&#39;s turn it was, a lot of support and a lot of help to my kids who&#39;d never been before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat evening, we went over to Des&#39; house for hotdogs then packed everyone up and took them to a Barracudas Hockey game.  I love hockey.  I&#39;ve only ever been to one other game before, but I&#39;ve always had a thing for the game.  Miss Des bought all the kids a souvenir hockey stick and then they got them signed by the &quot;Ice Girls&quot; (cheerleaders).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got home at 11pm last night I looked at my DH and said &quot;I know every day with them isn&#39;t going to be hockey and bowling, but whatever we do and invent, it&#39;s going to be a blast!!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMax, my kindergartener, has an amazing teacher.  I&#39;m going to let him finish this year out.  Simply because his teacher is one of the coolest I&#39;ve ever met.  I love her influence on him.  I also know that right now, Max needs to feel a little &quot;independent&quot;, which doesn&#39;t happen at home.  Morgan and Madison try to help him with everything.  It&#39;s a great trait of theirs, but it&#39;s not so good for Max sometimes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly ~ Eyes wide open<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82079,"nextTopicId":90564}}
