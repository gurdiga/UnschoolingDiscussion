Look at the props!<br/>\n<br/>\nI wound through stopping here and there and when it got to the party scene, I <br/>\nsaw Michael York.  I had forgotten he&#39;s in it!  That was great.  When we <br/>\nwatched Logan&#39;s Run, Marty and Holly both yelled &quot;It&#39;s Basil!&quot;   So I backed up to <br/>\nwhere he was dancing with Juliet and said &quot;Look, it&#39;s the guy from Austin <br/>\nPowers&quot; and Holly said &quot;And Logan&#39;s run!&quot;  So I let the movie run.  It&#39;s a <br/>\nbeautiful scene, and the music&#39;s nice, and after Holly had been watching for four or <br/>\nfive minutes, she said &quot;HEY, was this a trick!?&quot;   I laughed.  It hadn&#39;t been <br/>\na trick, but it was working like one.  Then the phone rang and she went to <br/>\nget it and the accidental trick was over.  She never did watch the rest, but she <br/>\nsaw enough to recognize it if she sees part of it in the future.

That may be all she wants to do, or she may have a few <br/>\nquestions or ideas about it.  (In many of the alternative schools, a <br/>\nteacher would come over and say, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re interested in rocks.  <br/>\nHere are some books and let&#39;s do this project and blah blah blah.&quot;  <br/>\nThe writer jokes that the child in the alternative school learns to <br/>\nhide his interests at all costs, because they get followed-up to <br/>\ndeath.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Entertainment -- a perfectly respectable way to learn, but the <br/>\nlearning is secondary to being entertained -- and this is the form <br/>\nthat schools are forced to use (he says).<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Following a passion -- the child doesn&#39;t want to sleep, eat, <br/>\nbathe, or do anything but find out more about x, or do more x.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrewing seems to lend itself to curious probing.  Listening <br/>\ncarefully to your child about interests lends itself to encouraging <br/>\nhis or her passions.  Both are good, but they are different.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Strewing (was Varieties of Unschoolers)","postDate":"1076544841","msgId":90892,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3Mi4yNTRlZjNmMC4yZDVjMWY0OUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":90883,"nextInTopic":90895,"prevInTime":90891,"nextInTime":90893,"topicId":90778,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/11/04 3:46:56 PM, danielle.conger@comcast.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1082090213\">In a message dated 2/11/04 3:46:56 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danielle.conger@...\">danielle.conger@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Strewing&#39;s not like leaving a newspaper article on the breakfast table for <br/>\nthe kids to read and report on later in however an informal way.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI leave articles out and nobody has to report ever.<br/>\nSometimes nobody sees them.

Sometimes, the conversations about strewing sound artificial to me.   I suppose the question is really of attitude and intent.  Are the objects strewn as options or shoulds?  And how attached are you to your child responding to the objects you have chosen to &quot;strew.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it kind of reminds me of my mother sending me articles that she thinks I should read.   I&#39;ve learned to smile at this - but i do appreciate when she asks me first if I am interested in receiving the article before sending it.<br/>\nLisa H.&gt;<br/>\n================================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is definitely the mindset of the folks in my local unschooling group, and although no one used the clipping example, that&#39;s exactly what popped into my mind, too. Strewing&#39;s not like leaving a newspaper article on the breakfast table for the kids to read and report on later in however an informal way. At least not how I take it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral posts today caused me to clarify my own thinking about strewing:<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra: &quot;Some families would never take their kids to a play or a musical or <br/>\na concert or a dance recital.   So in those cases, if their kids go on some <br/>\nfield trips they&#39;ve seen more than they might have otherwise.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra: &quot;My downfall is nature.  I don&#39;t much care.  So my kids aren&#39;t out in the <br/>\nwoods and mountains and desert as much as they should have been in their lives for <br/>\nthings to be the balanced ideal (the mental image I have of the perfect <br/>\nunschooling life).&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nPam: &quot;I do worry about unschooled kids and math - ONLY because so many of <br/>\ntheir parents are so math phobic that they don&#39;t &quot;naturally&quot; support <br/>\nthe math learning that would otherwise ordinarily happen in an <br/>\nunschooling family. I think unschooling parents have an obligation to <br/>\ntheir children to find a way to get past their own math anxieties and <br/>\nphobias.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nStrewing--bringing items into my home--becomes a way not only to facilitate my kids&#39; interests but also a way of compensating for my own deficiencies, a way of exposing my kids to things that they may not encounter in a more *natural* and less conscious way. On the one hand it is a gift, like a couple people have mentioned. On the other hand, it can also be a way of potentially sparking an interest in them that they&#39;re not going to encounter by my modeling. Yes, they may &quot;bump&quot; into that interest in some other unexpected and unpredictable kind of way, but I try to have as full and rich an environment as I can possibly have to facilitate learning and interests without waiting for them to bump into things. I guess this is what I mean by a proactive approach to unschooling--that and the fact that I believe in being very involved with my kids and not just letting them do things on their own. But they&#39;re young, they may need and want my involvement less as they get older. (And as my posting demonstrates, they do a *lot* of playing on their own already.) <br/>\n<br/>\nThe kinds of things my kids might be exposed to in my house are going to look quite different from my friends&#39; kids, for example, who are growing up in a very musical house. Some things like music, math or art, none of which are my own natural fortes, present themselves as gaps in my home that I try to fill in as many different ways as possible. I don&#39;t sit my kids down and say, &quot;okay, time to learn about math or music because otherwise you might not get it.&quot; Instead, I buy math games, strategy games, computer software that focuses on math or music, new CD&#39;s, books on ballet, videos of the Nutcracker and Swan Lake, books on artists--things I often enjoy just as much as my kids. All of this is in addition to museum trips, classes, clubs, etc. I certainly would never force these things, I don&#39;t even really suggest them unless I personally want to play/ watch/ read them, but I think leaving a gap is just as detrimental as force feeding.  What if my kids decide they *love* math? What if they missed out on knowing this for years because I didn&#39;t really try to have anything math oriented in the house because I&#39;m not a math person? Precisely because I *hate* it and shut down in pretty much the same way Sandra described, I feel a certain obligation to offer them as many fun, relaxed encounters with math as possible in case they do love it. I really hope that they never learn to hate it like I did. I use strewing in this sense to make up for my own biases and deficiencies, I guess. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think, absolutely, that the key to strewing is not having a vested interest in the outcome, not valuing one choice over any other choice. If I&#39;m having a party, I&#39;m definitely going to put out food that I love, but I&#39;d probably offer lots of other dishes as well to appeal to a variety of palates and people. I&#39;m not going to walk around judging the success of my party or my guests based on their food choices. Instead, I&#39;m going to walk around, talking to as many people as I can about any number of things and judge my party on how much people enjoyed themselves. Strewing, to me, is very much like having a party and offering as varied a buffet as possible from which my children freely choose and hopefully really enjoy themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks everyone for all the interesting conversations!<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152271008,"authorName":"Jon and Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"jonkream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Strewing (was Varieties of Unschoolers)","postDate":"1076538028","msgId":90880,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxM2IwMWMzZjBlZCQ0MTNhMjFiMCRiZDAwYThjMEBvPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTQtREFWNzFvM0NLMnc2bU4wMDAyNjk0MkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":90879,"nextInTopic":90882,"prevInTime":90879,"nextInTime":90881,"topicId":90778,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... **Sometimes they do to me, too.

I sat down with some big beads and began stringing them (he looked bored and I wanted a break anyway). Sure enough he joined in. I went on to clean a little while later and found a big egg cartoon (a 3 dozen flat) and dropped it over by my son. He started putting the beads in the different cups. If he never joined I would have had fun with the beads. If the egg carton never got a second look I would have picked it up my next go-round. Of course later I tackled him, threw him over my shoulder and gave him &#39;horsey&#39; rides on my back for a good half hour.

I loved what you wrote.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile my brain is quite sore from all the thinking I&#39;ve been doing lately, <br/>\nI am really enjoying this list. So much food for thought!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s rather trivial to post to the whole list... but the last few weeks <br/>\nhave been quite liberating, as I&#39;ve loosened my reins even more with the <br/>\ngirls. I was a &quot;gentle -guider,&quot; i.e., &quot;Why don&#39;t you turn off the TV and <br/>\ngo do XYZ [which will be more educational and make you think more]?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo more! I had to laugh the day my nearly four year old asked every half <br/>\nhour... &quot;Such-and-so show is off now. May I watch XYZ show?&quot; &quot;Sure, go <br/>\nahead, if you&#39;d like,&quot; I replied. She watched for about 4-5 hours, I think? <br/>\nLooked thrilled every time I said she could still watch if she wanted to do <br/>\nso, as I usually tried to keep their viewing to less than an hour or two a <br/>\nday... hard to do when four girls keep taking turns turning the TV on!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo my surprise (not sure why I&#39;d be surprised, but I was, pleasantly)... <br/>\nthey&#39;ve watched more TV on some days, and less on others. But when they&#39;re <br/>\nnot watching, they&#39;re so much more engaged in whatever they&#39;re doing. <br/>\nThey&#39;re nicer to each other - doing things together. Sometimes asking each <br/>\nother to leave the TV (or computer, or book, or toys, or whatever) and come <br/>\ndoing something together. They&#39;re discovering what it means to have a <br/>\nlittle more control of themselves, and they&#39;re choosing to use that control <br/>\nto learn more about the world around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I strew a bit, read with them, talk about things, get into doing <br/>\nwhatever they&#39;re doing, and we&#39;ve had a blast! And really, gotten more <br/>\n&quot;done&quot; (i.e., given me a sense of fulfillment) on our path of learning <br/>\ntogether than we ever would have the old way, except on those rare days <br/>\nwhen things seemed to go well, and I could go to bed knowing they &quot;learned&quot; <br/>\nsomething that day. Now, we have &quot;right and good&quot; days, to quote Sandra :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, they turned the living room into a &quot;museum,&quot; with areas of <br/>\ndisplays about the rainforest, owl pellets (they&#39;ve been dissecting), <br/>\npotato growing, books they&#39;ve been reading, etc. We had some friends stop <br/>\nby to visit our museum, having received free tickets at their front door <br/>\nearlier in the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir kids are in school, and were completely thrilled that this was the <br/>\nkind of stuff my girls get to do all day long. The dad was impressed, <br/>\nhaving not been a big fan of HS. And my girls got a new perspective on how <br/>\nlucky they are to be able to live like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this is long and wordy, but I wanted to thank you all for your <br/>\ninspiration and provocative thoughts.
