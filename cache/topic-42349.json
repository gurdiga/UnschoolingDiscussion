There will always be a questioning of thoughts <br/>\nand practices because we are all here to point towards unschooling and all <br/>\nthat it encompasses.<br/>\nPeople not wanting another persons opinon shouldn&#39;t ask for it.<br/>\nI am not an unschooler from birth.<br/>\nAre you implying that I can&#39;t be comfortable here.<br/>\nWell let me tell you, I was not an unschooler at all when I started <br/>\nhomeschooling. I had read John Holt and it encouraged me to homeschool, but I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t quite &quot;get it&quot;.<br/>\nAfter doing some damage to my older son I realized it and tried to change. We <br/>\nevolved into &quot;eclectic/relaxed&quot; type homeschoolers. Doing unit studies and <br/>\ntrying to let my kids lead the way a LOT more.<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t until I found unschooling.com a few years ago , that my ideas and <br/>\nbeliefs were able to be really questioned (uncomfortably so) and I found a <br/>\nlack within those beliefs.<br/>\nThankfully, Sandra, Joyce, Pam and other people here were willing to ask <br/>\nthose difficult, soul piercing questions that enabled me to shed some old <br/>\nbaggage.<br/>\nWe are unschoolers now, have been for a couple years. <br/>\nAs Mary says, &quot;Life is Good&quot;......<br/>\nBut I needed that questioning, that informations from &quot;old timers&quot; with older <br/>\nkids that this could and would work. I needed to trust my children more fully.<br/>\nIf a person isn&#39;t willing to questions their beliefs as parents, they aren&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to evolve into better parent&#39;s. It&#39;s that simple.<br/>\nQuestioning, seeking and being willing to change is necessary.  This is a <br/>\ngreat place to do that in an unschooling context.<br/>\nI really wish any newbies (or anyone else) that doesn&#39;t think the list will <br/>\nhelp them, will either read for a while and get the true feel for it, or go <br/>\nto another list.<br/>\nMaybe that seems rude. But it gets tiresome to see ladies that have changed <br/>\nyour life and brought incredible joy into your family with their influence, <br/>\nattacked at every turn.<br/>\nSomeone else was saying how much they loved Ned.<br/>\nWhy bring that up here?<br/>\nGo to a Ned list, he&#39;s out there ya know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42486,"nextTopicId":42371}}
