When kids <br/>\nare using math for real they have a vested interest in the answer. <br/>\nWhile a kid in school might see 34-17 and write 51 as the answer and <br/>\nnot care about the answer (it ends up in the trash either way), a child <br/>\nin a store with $34 wanting to know how much they&#39;ll have after <br/>\nspending $17 will know that $51 isn&#39;t right and will care that it isn&#39;t <br/>\nright and they&#39;ll figure out why (or ask for help).

Instead of seeing this behavior as being a negative thing, I look<br/>\nat it this way:  They are doing their work, their way.  How much of your day<br/>\nis spent doing what someone else tells you to do?  I don&#39;t spend one minute<br/>\nof my day that way!  My husband and kids can ask me to do something, but I<br/>\ncertainly don&#39;t feel like I have to!  I get to decide how I will spend my<br/>\nday--how long I will hang out with the kids, how hard I will work and at<br/>\nwhat, how long I sit around and read after lunch, whether I want to take a<br/>\nshower or not!

They may be just lowering their<br/>\nstress levels by playing video games, which is also a good thing!  Beats<br/>\ndrugs, alcohol, and hitting each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you will slow up and spend some time with your sons, you will<br/>\nprobably find out they are learning the entire time they are at it!
