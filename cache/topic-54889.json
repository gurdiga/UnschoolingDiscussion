I want him to get the grade to prove that <br/>\nhe is learning math. isn&#39;t that incredible? I hdan&#39;t realized how <br/>\nmuch I felt this way! Yet if we were using a tutor or he was doing <br/>\nAlgebra II at home with a video curricula, I wouldn&#39;t even flinch at <br/>\nhis scores or grades. He woudn&#39;t have any. Instead he&#39;d have <br/>\nknowledge of Algebra II. And that would be what we were after.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter this week&#39;s worth of reading this list, I suddenly got it last <br/>\nnight.
