Let me also<br/>\n&gt; add that there are <br/>\n&gt; many types of schooling that cross some lines... but<br/>\n&gt; they are all very <br/>\n&gt; unique in their own right (unschooling, Waldorf,<br/>\n&gt; Montessori, Sudbury etc)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A few months back I did get into this subject on<br/>\n&gt; another unschooling list <br/>\n&gt; and I might was well repost my thoughts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; MARIE MONTESSORI&#39;S WORK:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wholeheartedly agree that she was ahead of her<br/>\n&gt; time and her theorys are <br/>\n&gt; a genteel way to treat children, I see her quotes<br/>\n&gt; about learning by <br/>\n&gt; certain ages and presenting learning opportunities<br/>\n&gt; (as opposed to the <br/>\n&gt; child asking) to be contradictory almost to herself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Its POSSIBLE that the year she resided in was a<br/>\n&gt; major factor in some of <br/>\n&gt; her writings, hence the contradicitons.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My greatgrandmother and ggf lived in Italy at that<br/>\n&gt; time, and luckily for <br/>\n&gt; my family, they were way ahead of their time in<br/>\n&gt; regards to cultural <br/>\n&gt; advances.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maria also had a great insight of the spiritual and<br/>\n&gt; how children are <br/>\n&gt; connected. Yet, I suppose this would fall prey to<br/>\n&gt; many religions and <br/>\n&gt; belief systems.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Its very sad to see that her theorys (without the<br/>\n&gt; age parts I will list <br/>\n&gt; below), are not followed by the Montessori of today.<br/>\n&gt; Sadder yet is some <br/>\n&gt; of the writings of Mario Montessori, Jr (I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know the relation) that <br/>\n&gt; seem to contradict Maria. Such as:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Teachers must uphold the rules of the school<br/>\n&gt; community for the benefit <br/>\n&gt; of the group as well as that of individual children.<br/>\n&gt; Accordingly the only <br/>\n&gt; punishment in Montessori education is isolation from<br/>\n&gt; the group for a <br/>\n&gt; temporary period&quot; (page 26, Mario Montessori, Jr.,<br/>\n&gt; Education for Human <br/>\n&gt; Development: Understanding Montessori). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This says that making a &#39;time-out&#39; is more necessary<br/>\n&gt; to solving the issue <br/>\n&gt; either by mediation or via a democratic process.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here are the age discriminations that I have found<br/>\n&gt; in the writing:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Montessori drew on the studies of the &quot;Wild Boy of<br/>\n&gt; Aveyron&quot; who was found <br/>\n&gt; in a forest in the 1800s. He had been without human<br/>\n&gt; interaction for about <br/>\n&gt; ten years. Eighteenth century physician Jean Itard<br/>\n&gt; studied the child at <br/>\n&gt; length, considering him raw material and prime for<br/>\n&gt; studies about the <br/>\n&gt; relative importance of nature vs. nurture. When the<br/>\n&gt; boy failed to learn <br/>\n&gt; to speak and do other basic functions, Itard<br/>\n&gt; speculated that there are <br/>\n&gt; learning periods in human development when growth<br/>\n&gt; potential is prime. He <br/>\n&gt; believed that the Wild Boy had missed the prime<br/>\n&gt; window for learning <br/>\n&gt; speech. He believed that it was essential to observe<br/>\n&gt; the educational <br/>\n&gt; process carefully to determine the best times to<br/>\n&gt; present learning <br/>\n&gt; opportunities. <br/>\n&gt; *Montessori agreed and this concept became the<br/>\n&gt; backbone of her methods.*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;If during conception, gestation, birth and the<br/>\n&gt; subsequent period the <br/>\n&gt; child <br/>\n&gt; has had scientific care, then at the age of 3 the<br/>\n&gt; child should be a model <br/>\n&gt; ind<br/>\n&gt; ividual; but this seldom happens, for the child has<br/>\n&gt; usually met with many <br/>\n&gt; accidents. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;No one can be free unless he is independent....a<br/>\n&gt; weaned child...is still <br/>\n&gt; dependent, since he is not yet able to walk, and<br/>\n&gt; cannot wash and dress <br/>\n&gt; himself, and since he is not able to ask for things<br/>\n&gt; in a language which <br/>\n&gt; is <br/>\n&gt; clear and easily understood. He is still in this<br/>\n&gt; period to a great extent <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; slave of everyone&quot; [I&#39;ll interject here about the<br/>\n&gt; weaning child not being <br/>\n&gt; able to walk. It imposes an age limit on nursing,<br/>\n&gt; not a child&#39;s decision <br/>\n&gt; on when to quit]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enquiries into the home life follow...This<br/>\n&gt; questionnaire is necessary <br/>\n&gt; because <br/>\n&gt; almost all children come to us with strange<br/>\n&gt; characteristics and <br/>\n&gt; naughtiness, <br/>\n&gt; and these must be traced and understood in order to<br/>\n&gt; be cured&quot; (page 74, <br/>\n&gt; Education for a New World).  [I&#39;ll concede that the <br/>\n&gt; &#39;naughtiness&#39; part <br/>\n&gt; could be translation difficulties, but again it<br/>\n&gt; shows that it needs to be <br/>\n&gt; cured]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;...there is an unusual demand on the part of the<br/>\n&gt; child to know the <br/>\n&gt; reasons <br/>\n&gt; of things. Knowledge can be best given where there<br/>\n&gt; is eagerness to learn, <br/>\n&gt; so <br/>\n&gt; this is the period (age 6 to 12) when the seed of<br/>\n&gt; everything can be sown, <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; child&#39;s mind being like a fertile field, ready to<br/>\n&gt; receive what will <br/>\n&gt; germinate <br/>\n&gt; into culture&quot; (page 4, To Educate the Human<br/>\n&gt; Potential).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The history of civilization is a history of<br/>\n&gt; successful attempts to <br/>\n&gt; organize <br/>\n&gt; work and to obtain liberty. On the whole, man&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; goodness has also <br/>\n&gt; increased, <br/>\n&gt; as is shown by his progress from barbarism to<br/>\n&gt; civilization, and it may be <br/>\n&gt; said that crime, the various forms of wickedness,<br/>\n&gt; cruelty and violence <br/>\n&gt; have <br/>\n&gt; been gradually decreasing during this passage of<br/>\n&gt; time.  [This is <br/>\n&gt; interesting, she seems to think that cruelty and<br/>\n&gt; violence have decreased. <br/>\n&gt; Whilst I feel it just changed form from barbaric<br/>\n&gt; times.]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Here lies the attraction that will polarise the<br/>\n&gt; will of the child. The <br/>\n&gt; teacher, as part of the environment, must herself be<br/>\n&gt; attractive, <br/>\n&gt; preferably young and beautiful, charmingly dressed,<br/>\n&gt; scented with <br/>\n&gt; cleanliness, happy and graciously dignified. She<br/>\n&gt; should study her<br/>\n&gt; movements, making them as gentle and graceful as<br/>\n&gt; possible, that the child <br/>\n&gt; may unconsciously pay her the compliment of thinking<br/>\n&gt; her as beautiful as <br/>\n&gt; his mother&quot; (page 87, Education for a New World).<br/>\n&gt; [Okay, it could be a <br/>\n&gt; cultural thing, but I don&#39;t feel an attractive mom<br/>\n&gt; is going to yield <br/>\n&gt; better results than one who is not beautiful in the<br/>\n&gt; acceptable range that <br/>\n&gt; our culture calls beauty]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;It is essential that civilisation should produce<br/>\n&gt; beautiful children. An <br/>\n&gt; old fashioned dictum has been that &#39;beauty is but<br/>\n&gt; skin-deep&#39;, and <br/>\n&gt; children have been dissuaded from looking in the<br/>\n&gt; mirror, as smacking of <br/>\n&gt; sinful vanity. But we claim that schools should be<br/>\n&gt; institutions to help <br/>\n&gt; beauty, because beauty is an indication of healthy<br/>\n&gt; conditions of life. <br/>\n&gt; Good conditions induce beauty of form, and it is<br/>\n&gt; part of the Montessori <br/>\n&gt; Method to achieve such harmony&quot; (page 114-115, To<br/>\n&gt; Educate the Human <br/>\n&gt; Potential). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The following is from a biography on her.

Let me also add that there are <br/>\nmany types of schooling that cross some lines... but they are all very <br/>\nunique in their own right (unschooling, Waldorf, Montessori, Sudbury etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nA few months back I did get into this subject on another unschooling list <br/>\nand I might was well repost my thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMARIE MONTESSORI&#39;S WORK:<br/>\n<br/>\nI wholeheartedly agree that she was ahead of her time and her theorys are <br/>\na genteel way to treat children, I see her quotes about learning by <br/>\ncertain ages and presenting learning opportunities (as opposed to the <br/>\nchild asking) to be contradictory almost to herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts POSSIBLE that the year she resided in was a major factor in some of <br/>\nher writings, hence the contradicitons.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy greatgrandmother and ggf lived in Italy at that time, and luckily for <br/>\nmy family, they were way ahead of their time in regards to cultural <br/>\nadvances.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaria also had a great insight of the spiritual and how children are <br/>\nconnected. Yet, I suppose this would fall prey to many religions and <br/>\nbelief systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts very sad to see that her theorys (without the age parts I will list <br/>\nbelow), are not followed by the Montessori of today. Sadder yet is some <br/>\nof the writings of Mario Montessori, Jr (I don&#39;t know the relation) that <br/>\nseem to contradict Maria. Such as:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Teachers must uphold the rules of the school community for the benefit <br/>\nof the group as well as that of individual children. Accordingly the only <br/>\npunishment in Montessori education is isolation from the group for a <br/>\ntemporary period&quot; (page 26, Mario Montessori, Jr., Education for Human <br/>\nDevelopment: Understanding Montessori). <br/>\n<br/>\nThis says that making a &#39;time-out&#39; is more necessary to solving the issue <br/>\neither by mediation or via a democratic process.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the age discriminations that I have found in the writing:<br/>\n<br/>\nMontessori drew on the studies of the &quot;Wild Boy of Aveyron&quot; who was found <br/>\nin a forest in the 1800s. He had been without human interaction for about <br/>\nten years. Eighteenth century physician Jean Itard studied the child at <br/>\nlength, considering him raw material and prime for studies about the <br/>\nrelative importance of nature vs. nurture. When the boy failed to learn <br/>\nto speak and do other basic functions, Itard speculated that there are <br/>\nlearning periods in human development when growth potential is prime. He <br/>\nbelieved that the Wild Boy had missed the prime window for learning <br/>\nspeech. He believed that it was essential to observe the educational <br/>\nprocess carefully to determine the best times to present learning <br/>\nopportunities. <br/>\n*Montessori agreed and this concept became the backbone of her methods.*<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If during conception, gestation, birth and the subsequent period the <br/>\nchild <br/>\nhas had scientific care, then at the age of 3 the child should be a model <br/>\nind<br/>\nividual; but this seldom happens, for the child has usually met with many <br/>\naccidents. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No one can be free unless he is independent....a weaned child...is still <br/>\ndependent, since he is not yet able to walk, and cannot wash and dress <br/>\nhimself, and since he is not able to ask for things in a language which <br/>\nis <br/>\nclear and easily understood. He is still in this period to a great extent <br/>\nthe <br/>\nslave of everyone&quot; [I&#39;ll interject here about the weaning child not being <br/>\nable to walk. It imposes an age limit on nursing, not a child&#39;s decision <br/>\non when to quit]<br/>\n<br/>\nEnquiries into the home life follow...This questionnaire is necessary <br/>\nbecause <br/>\nalmost all children come to us with strange characteristics and <br/>\nnaughtiness, <br/>\nand these must be traced and understood in order to be cured&quot; (page 74, <br/>\nEducation for a New World).  [I&#39;ll concede that the  &#39;naughtiness&#39; part <br/>\ncould be translation difficulties, but again it shows that it needs to be <br/>\ncured]<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...there is an unusual demand on the part of the child to know the <br/>\nreasons <br/>\nof things. Knowledge can be best given where there is eagerness to learn, <br/>\nso <br/>\nthis is the period (age 6 to 12) when the seed of everything can be sown, <br/>\nthe <br/>\nchild&#39;s mind being like a fertile field, ready to receive what will <br/>\ngerminate <br/>\ninto culture&quot; (page 4, To Educate the Human Potential).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe history of civilization is a history of successful attempts to <br/>\norganize <br/>\nwork and to obtain liberty. On the whole, man&#39;s goodness has also <br/>\nincreased, <br/>\nas is shown by his progress from barbarism to civilization, and it may be <br/>\nsaid that crime, the various forms of wickedness, cruelty and violence <br/>\nhave <br/>\nbeen gradually decreasing during this passage of time.  [This is <br/>\ninteresting, she seems to think that cruelty and violence have decreased. <br/>\nWhilst I feel it just changed form from barbaric times.]<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Here lies the attraction that will polarise the will of the child. The <br/>\nteacher, as part of the environment, must herself be attractive, <br/>\npreferably young and beautiful, charmingly dressed, scented with <br/>\ncleanliness, happy and graciously dignified. She should study her<br/>\nmovements, making them as gentle and graceful as possible, that the child <br/>\nmay unconsciously pay her the compliment of thinking her as beautiful as <br/>\nhis mother&quot; (page 87, Education for a New World). [Okay, it could be a <br/>\ncultural thing, but I don&#39;t feel an attractive mom is going to yield <br/>\nbetter results than one who is not beautiful in the acceptable range that <br/>\nour culture calls beauty]<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It is essential that civilisation should produce beautiful children. An <br/>\nold fashioned dictum has been that &#39;beauty is but skin-deep&#39;, and <br/>\nchildren have been dissuaded from looking in the mirror, as smacking of <br/>\nsinful vanity. But we claim that schools should be institutions to help <br/>\nbeauty, because beauty is an indication of healthy conditions of life. <br/>\nGood conditions induce beauty of form, and it is part of the Montessori <br/>\nMethod to achieve such harmony&quot; (page 114-115, To Educate the Human <br/>\nPotential). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following is from a biography on her. It makes reference to her <br/>\nachivements of children learning to read and math by the age of four. I <br/>\nwonder what she would say if I told her the 12 year old can&#39;t read. Would <br/>\nthe &#39;window of learning&#39; be closed in her mind?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; In <br/>\ntwo years time some of her &quot;deficient&quot; students were able to pass <br/>\nstandard <br/>\ntests for Italian School Children. She was lauded for this achievement <br/>\nbut <br/>\nreplied that public schools should be able to get far better results, <br/>\nthen, <br/>\nwith her methods, than with their traditional ones. The government didn&#39;t <br/>\nallow her that chance, so she started to work with poor day care children <br/>\ntoo <br/>\nyoung to attend school. These children were examples of the worst poverty <br/>\ncan <br/>\nbring out of people, and at first Montessori doubted her methods could <br/>\nwork <br/>\nunder these conditions. However, she gave them a try and her successes <br/>\nwere <br/>\neven greater than with the retarded children. These children did not need <br/>\nto <br/>\nbe prodded to participate as the hospitalized children did. They were <br/>\neager <br/>\nto learn and begged for more. They were fascinated by numbers and were <br/>\nadding <br/>\nfour and five digit numbers at the ages of four and five. Their <br/>\nenthusiasm <br/>\nwas so great that Montessori spent many nights awake into the wee hours <br/>\nmaking new learning tools for them. Her style of mathematics blocks and <br/>\ntiles <br/>\nare still in use today. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep seeing &#39;Make learning fun, and they&#39;ll learn what they need to&#39; in <br/>\nthe above.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease let me reiterate that I feel she was great in her own right. I <br/>\njust don&#39;t see the principles that closely knit to unschooling. I see <br/>\nsimilarities. Just as I see them amonst all types of education. But each <br/>\ntype is in of itself its own method.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nkolleen<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;People take different roads seeking <br/>\nfulfillment and happiness. Just <br/>\nbecause they&#39;re not on your road <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve gotten lost.&quot;<br/>\n             -H.
