But, my daughter was able to spend a day at our local regional high school. She went as a visitor with a student who went to the school. The girl had to request permission from each of her teachers. It was eye-opening to my daughter -- she liked the french class, probably because she is studying french at the local community college. She found the day very disjointed, moving from class to class -- never fully covering anything. In the grammar/reading class my daughter helped show the class how to read poetry with feeling -- the teacher was so impressed she invited my daughter back for a reading of Anne Frank. My dd has never had a reading/grammar class in her life. I found this quite amusing. It is doubtful that my daughter will go, she said she attempted to read the book a while ago, and found it too hard (emotionally) on her.

Using a full curriculum is not <br/>\nunschooling. Unschooling is &quot;not schooling.&quot;<br/>\nBut when unschoolers choose to attend school or use a curriculum, it is <br/>\na very different experience than it is for kids who are there with no <br/>\nchoice.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughters will identify themselves as unschoolers - they&#39;ve been <br/>\nraised as unschoolers for long enough that that is their identity - it <br/>\nisn&#39;t just something they &quot;do.&quot; They really truly feel there is a <br/>\ndefinite difference between people who have been unschooled and those <br/>\nwho have been schooled - a difference that persists beyond school age. <br/>\nBut my daughter who is a full-time college student studying for a <br/>\nspecific degree is not &quot;unschooling college.&quot; She is an unschooler who <br/>\nis no longer unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Schooling Unschoolers","postDate":"1110241382","msgId":104242,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjYwMWM1MjM3NSRmOTU5NmJhMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBob21lPg==","referencesHeader":"PEJFNTA1NEY3LjMxQUY4JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":104243,"prevInTime":104241,"nextInTime":104243,"topicId":104242,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I know a few homeschooling families who say that their children have chosen to use a curriulum - or attend school - , but consider it unschooling because the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-810695100\">I know a few homeschooling families who say that their children have chosen to use a curriulum - or attend school - , but consider it unschooling because the child chose it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt what point is it no longer unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104377,"nextTopicId":104316}}
