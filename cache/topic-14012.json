We are Wiyot and live in Northern California.&nbsp; We were \nlistening to our mom when she was talking about how people are always doing \nthings for people in other countries and never realize that one of the poorest \nplaces in the world is right here in the U.S.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">We asked her about this and, being unschoolers, she \ngave us one of those looks.&nbsp; So we headed to the library and then got on \nthe net to do some research and we were really surprised at what we found!&nbsp; \nWe decided to &quot;adopt&quot; the elderly living on the &quot;cold&quot; reservations.&nbsp; \nWinter is the worst time because only one out of every five hogans has any \nreliable source of heat.&nbsp; We decided to learn to crochet and make \nafghans.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">We set a goal of each of us getting one afghan done \nbefore Christmas.&nbsp; But, we got to thinking that wouldn&#39;t be very \nmuch.&nbsp; We put this letter together so that maybe other homeschoolers would \njoin us in our project which we call &quot;Stop The Frostbite.&quot;</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">So, since we think unschoolers and homeschoolers \nare the greatest people in the world, we thought some other kids might like to \nhelp.&nbsp; Mom says that folks who have to do portfolios can use this as \nhistory, current events, math (counting all those chains and crochets and \nworking with patterns), art and community service.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">You can e-mail us at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>.&nbsp; We will be \nputting together a big box to mail on December 15 and will try to do one every \nsix weeks after that.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Respectfully,</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Your homeschooling friends</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Derek, Kirk and Krystin</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">P.S.&nbsp; If you have any coats, sweaters or \nblankets you might want to donate, our mom has addresses to send them \nto.</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14007,"nextTopicId":14014}}
