It&#39;s a bummer that there&#39;s so much hype and almost <br/>\nhysteria around our bodies.  When I was 13 back in 1971 I went on a camping <br/>\ntrip with my older sister.  Truth be told, it was a bunch of hippies.  If <br/>\nmy parents had been wise to what was going on there, I&#39;m sure I would not <br/>\nhave been permitted to go.  It was a 4-1/2-mile hike straight uphill from <br/>\nthe road where our dad dropped us off, and we camped there for two <br/>\nweeks.  When I was 13, I was fairly innocent; I was not all that aware of <br/>\ndrugs, I did not smoke cigarettes, I didn&#39;t even know that many curse words.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo, there were a lot of people camping at this particular spot <br/>\nalso.  It wasn&#39;t like the campgrounds you see today.  It was this wonderful <br/>\nhuge pond along the Appalachian Trail and people would just find a fairly <br/>\nlevel spot, set up their tarps (to protect our guitars from the elements) <br/>\nand sleeping bags, and build a fire pit.  Every now and again you&#39;d see a <br/>\ntent, but that was really rare.  It was mighty funky.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was very interesting (understatement) to me was that there was a <br/>\ntremendous amount of nudity.  Sometimes, people were just walking around <br/>\nnaked. Sometimes folks would just get naked to swim.  The first night I was <br/>\nthere, I was pretty uncomfortable and I didn&#39;t know what to rest my eyes <br/>\non, but it was *the culture* there. You just couldn&#39;t stay uncomfortable <br/>\nwith it for long.  So...I got comfortable.  I got very comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never used my bathing suit the whole time I was there.  You were only <br/>\nallowed to camp there for three nights, so whenever a park ranger would <br/>\ncome along, we&#39;d strip and jump into the pond and swim all the way across <br/>\nthe pond to someone else&#39;s campsite (about a half mile or so) until the <br/>\ncoast was clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut something weird happened.  One day I was out in the pond swimming, and <br/>\na bunch of Boy Scouts were hiking along the trail.  When they saw me out <br/>\nthere swimming naked, they all started yelling at me and cat-calling and <br/>\nall sorts of embarrassing stuff.  I felt that I could not come out of the <br/>\nwater.  A friend saw what was going on and tossed me out a shirt, and I was <br/>\nable to get out.  The whole thing made me sad and it made me think.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have continued the tradition in our family of being comfortable with our <br/>\nbodies.  Liam is naked easily as much as he is dressed and in the <br/>\nsummertime our house is a clothing-optional house.
