My oldest is 8 and he went for k and 1. My daughter went for 1 month of k before they were both pulled. Our Christ centered life is a HUGE part of how we unschool and even why we unschool. I think the Bible does teach us that we are to learn from life as we go through it. <br/>\nI just thought I would speak up and let you know that there are Christians on this list. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGod bless<br/>\nVivian<br/>\nMom to three Happy little Monkeys<br/>\nAustin 10/31/93 Sarah 8/28/95 Emmalee 8/15/00<br/>\nAnd loving wife to Randy<br/>\n<br/>\n**If fifty million people say a foolish thing, it is still a foolish thing.<br/>\n-Anatole France***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Valerie Cifuentes <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, April 24, 2002 8:29 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Intro: Hey BRIDGET<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If mom is always saying &quot;this looks fun, wanna go?&quot; <br/>\n  there is a chance that the kidlet will think she wants him to go and <br/>\n  do it for that reason.

LOL!<br/>\n  We have that kind of relationship. We live together and we KNOW each<br/>\n  other well.<br/>\n  But I do think parents have the right to introduce their ideas to their<br/>\n  children. That&#39;s what wonderful and unique about FAMILY. We, as parents,<br/>\n  impart things to our children that we hold dear or important. The child<br/>\n  will, of course, agree or disagree as an individual regardless of my<br/>\n  passion for whatever I&#39;m imparting. Usually my children have a &quot;prove it<br/>\n  to me, show me that it&#39;s true and that it makes sense.&quot; Then the burden<br/>\n  lies on me to produce that evidence. I think that is a good skill for my<br/>\n  kids and for me to have. I didn&#39;t have the skill of proving anything<br/>\n  prior to having my children! LOL! They have been a huge learning<br/>\n  experience for me too.<br/>\n  We are Christians, I impart to and teach my children our faith. I use<br/>\n  the Bible (a curriculum in a sense.)As a Christian I do not feel it&#39;s<br/>\n  wise to allow my children to just &quot;explore&quot; the world without the<br/>\n  knowledge of God.<br/>\n  For instance, biology, my children have learned that God is the<br/>\n  &quot;intelligence&quot; that put it all together. I handed them what I believe<br/>\n  and I found ways to &quot;prove it&quot; to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please, let&#39;s not turn this into a religious debate. :o)I have a feeling<br/>\n  some here my jump on this. The above is the first example that came to<br/>\n  my mind of using my parental influence in my child&#39;s &quot;education.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for letting me share.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br/>\n  .· ´¨¨))  -:¦:-<br/>\n             ¸.·´ .·´¨¨))<br/>\n          ((¸¸.·´   .·´   -:¦:-Valerie Cifuentes<br/>\n        -:¦:-    ((¸¸.·´*<br/>\n  I CAN NO LONGER ACCEPT FORWARDS, CHAIN LETTERS AND PETITIONS.

I know one family where one of the kids <br/>\n  LOVES workbooks and does thme all the time and asks for more.  So yes, <br/>\n  workbooks can be unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But I also think that parents can have influence they don&#39;t understand <br/>\n  or even see.  They may be subtly promoting something so the kids does <br/>\n  it because his perception is that it will please his parent.  This can <br/>\n  be workbooks, but it can also happen with all the other things we&#39;ve <br/>\n  talked about.  If mom is always saying &quot;this looks fun, wanna go?&quot; <br/>\n  there is a chance that the kidlet will think she wants him to go and <br/>\n  do it for that reason.  And guarding against that can be very  <br/>\n  difficult with some kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Bridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Lisa Breger&quot; &lt;lisa@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Why isn&#39;t it unschooling if you set up an activity from one of these <br/>\n  books,<br/>\n  &gt; but the kids are free to take it or leave it?  How is it different <br/>\n  from<br/>\n  &gt; having a fun computer math game available, such as Sandra mentioned <br/>\n  she<br/>\n  &gt; played with Holly?<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; I understand that even presenting children with certain &quot;academic&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; activities can imply the parent feels they are necessary in an <br/>\n  educational<br/>\n  &gt; sense, but if the child can say &quot;no thank you&quot; isn&#39;t it worthwhile <br/>\n  to offer,<br/>\n  &gt; just for fun?  When I say this I mean &quot;offer&quot; once in a while, as it <br/>\n  comes<br/>\n  &gt; up or when I think it might be fun or fit in with something else <br/>\n  that<br/>\n  &gt; happened recently.  I do not mena &quot;planning a curriculum&quot; and then <br/>\n  offering<br/>\n  &gt; it to the kids with the hopes they will finish it.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Lisa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yahoo!
