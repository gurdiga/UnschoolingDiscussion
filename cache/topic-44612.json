Hhe was worried that he wasn&#39;t doing any schoolwork like other kids...I got out my journal and pointed out to him all the great stuff he has been doing lately and the learning thus involved  It really helped him to see he *is learning all the time. Maybe this sort of journalling would help your son - you journal and share your thoughts with him...<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;He&#39;salways asking me &quot;What can I do mom...&quot;  UGH.... HATE that question. &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have many limits in your home? I only ask this, because I noticed that my kids used to feel restless when there were limits, apart from natural ones!,  on what they could do - when they can watch a video or play the computer or walk to the library etc their options seem limitless and they are less likely to feel restless. If it still happens, I usually suggest something, do something with them ...Leonie W. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] new girl on the block","postDate":"1032969557","msgId":44614,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVhLjJlNmEwOTg1LjJhYzMzNzU1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":44613,"nextInTopic":44634,"prevInTime":44613,"nextInTime":44615,"topicId":44612,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/25/02 9:15:41 AM, bnatkbdpj@onewest.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1930891733\">In a message dated 9/25/02 9:15:41 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bnatkbdpj@...\">bnatkbdpj@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; He&#39;s<br/>\nalways asking me &quot;What can I do mom...&quot;  UGH....
