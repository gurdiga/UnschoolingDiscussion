I wanted to put myself in the place of a beginner,<br/>\n  so I looked in the paper for somebody who was giving private lessons in some<br/>\n  language I&#39;d never studied or had any other experience with. I found a<br/>\n  Russian teacher (and native speaker of Russian - very important).<br/>\n<br/>\n  I equipped myself with a tape recorder and asked her to come to my<br/>\n  apartment. I told her I wanted her to narrate my actions in Russian. I had<br/>\n  her talk to me in Russian only. I didn&#39;t speak at all, at first.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I would, for example, put my hand on top of my head, then put my hand on the<br/>\n  table, then put a book on top of my head. She had to say, in Russian,<br/>\n  something like, &quot;You&#39;re putting your hand on top of your head, now you put<br/>\n  your hand on the table, now you&#39;re putting that book on top of your head.&quot;<br/>\n  (Note that minor variations in phrasing crop up, like putting things in the<br/>\n  present or the past tense, adding &quot;now&quot; or not, etc. The important thing is<br/>\n  for the person to speak naturally.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I recorded all of this. Then, after a few minutes, I&#39;d play back the<br/>\n  recording, trying to do what I had just done again, in time to the<br/>\n  recording. If I got it wrong, she&#39;d gesture to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The entire process was under my control. Sometimes I relied on my memory for<br/>\n  what I&#39;d just done, and other times some word would seem to leap out at me<br/>\n  and I&#39;d experiment with whether it might mean &quot;hand&quot; or &quot;head&quot; or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The &quot;teacher&quot; had no way of judging how much or how fast I was learning,<br/>\n  which took all the pressure off me. Then, at my leisure and on my own time,<br/>\n  I&#39;d play back the recordings I&#39;d made - sometimes while doing something else<br/>\n  like washing the dishes (in which case I&#39;d just let the sounds of Russian<br/>\n  wash over me) and sometimes listening more intently and trying to figure out<br/>\n  specific things. At some point I played back some bits to her and had her<br/>\n  write them out so I could get a feel for how they looked.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We went very quickly from a kind of rigid &quot;you-narrate-what-I-do&quot; thing to a<br/>\n  kind of conversation, with little drawings back and forth when we didn&#39;t<br/>\n  understand each other. I can&#39;t tell you how many sessions we did together<br/>\n  before I began to spontaneously say a word here and there in Russian, but it<br/>\n  wasn&#39;t many.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I continued with this method for a few months (even though none of my<br/>\n  English students found it at all helpful) because I enjoyed it so much.<br/>\n  Later I bought a couple of Russian children&#39;s books, and one of those &quot;in 20<br/>\n  easy lessons&quot; paperbacks, but the main method continued to be her speaking<br/>\n  in Russian, and me gesturing and employing the few words and phrases I knew.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You really should try to get a native speaker.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It should also be someone who&#39;s willing to take on a fairly passive role. My<br/>\n  teacher did some odd things at first because she wasn&#39;t used to this. Within<br/>\n  the first few minutes of the first class, she launched into an explanation<br/>\n  of why she was using a certain preposition in the phrase, &quot;You walk over to<br/>\n  the wardrobe&quot; (I only realized this much later, when I was listening to that<br/>\n  first tape after having learned enough Russian to have an idea of what she<br/>\n  must be saying).<br/>\n<br/>\n  She also started off by saying, for example, &quot;I put the book on my head&quot;<br/>\n  instead of, &quot;You put the book on your head&quot;. (She must have been trying to<br/>\n  get INSIDE my head, in an effort to help me learn faster - again, I only<br/>\n  figured this out later on, and I was confused about &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot; for some<br/>\n  time after that.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  The English students I suggested this method to hated it. They wanted to be<br/>\n  passive. They felt I wasn&#39;t earning my pay if I didn&#39;t sit them down and<br/>\n  have them do exercises, and correct them. Or they felt too panicky when they<br/>\n  didn&#39;t immediately understand everything I said.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If anybody on this list tries this method, please email me privately about<br/>\n  how it goes.
