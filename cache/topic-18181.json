I guess this mom got a crash course in the last 7 weeks! She hates \nrepitition, likes to write but will write whenever she wants...doesn&#39;t care for \ncursive much...knows how to do it, but doesnt like being &#39;forced&#39; to do it every \nday on every single subject (that was one of her pet peeves in ps), loves music \nand is very musical, loves to dance to music, is very expressive physically. \nWill hug when she wants to and will sometimes give me one if I ask for \none...loves math, but not the repitition. She already knows how to use a cash \nregister, can figure in her mind how much change to give back (thanks to friends \nthat taught her how to do it in a coffee shop), doesn&#39;t like me trying to \nexplain things to her (her favorite phrase lately is I&#39;m not stupid!...which I \ndespair of her ever to stop saying), loves watching disney especially the \nmorning runs where they do the little kidlet shows with different learning stuff \nlike in the box and is developing rapidly...very conscious of her body changes, \nvery private and will not allow me anywhere near when getting dressed...but \nstill likes to have me sit with her in the bathroom when taking a bath and still \nWONT run her own bath water. She is a contradiction of child and pre-teen and it \nis scary at times and surprising at others. I guess with this one, since I \ndidn&#39;t grow up with her sister (summer visits only) I&#39;m learning what it means \nto be a child and pre-teen all at once.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Pooh\">Jessica</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vaughnde Lee<br>Missoula, Montana<br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stampinbookworm.eboard.com\">http://www.stampinbookworm.eboard.com</a><br></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;\">\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>-----Original Message-----</b><br><b>From: \n  </b><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marbleface@...\">marbleface@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marbleface@...\">marbleface@...</a>&gt;<br><b>To: </b><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> \n  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br><b>Date: \n  </b>Friday, April 06, 2001 5:22 PM<br><b>Subject: </b>Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] \n  math questions...<br><br></font></div><font face=\"arial,helvetica\"><font\n size=\"2\">In a message dated 04/06/2001 4:50:27 PM !!!First Boot!!!, <br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:livinglighthouse@...\">livinglighthouse@...</a> \n  writes: <br><br><br>\n  <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#0000ff 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;\"\n TYPE=\"CITE\"><b>......he gets frustrated not knowing the answers to questions \n    because he is <br>just guessing a lot of the time so he sees memorization as \n    a way to <br>eliminate that frustration.</b> <br><br><b>I appreciate your \n    show of interest in the underlying factors here, I look <br>forward to \n    getting more of your input. &nbsp;Thank you......</b> <br><b>Rachel</b> \n    <br><br><br><br></blockquote><br><br><br>Well, my interest is real. &nbsp;We \n  enjoy math around here (today&#39;s highlight was <br>a discussion that came from \n  my son&#39;s questions about how to run a retail <br>store -- a store that sells \n  TVs -- and all the costs you might have and what <br>your profit would be -- \n  this talk would not have been possible without math <br>-- it&#39;s a good tool!) \n  and it is interesting and frustrating to me to see a <br>bright boy like your \n  son getting stuck on not liking it. <br><br>I have been thinking about your \n  note and, please don&#39;t take offense, but I <br>don&#39;t think this is so much his \n  problem. <br><br>I am thinking that your son learns differently from you. \n  &nbsp;This makes it hard <br>for you to accept that he is actually learning \n  (enough) when doing things <br>like Legos or doing math in his head. \n  &nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#39;t see any &quot;proof&quot; -- or not <br>as much as you might be \n  expecting. <br><br>This is just my guess from your comments. &nbsp;And others \n  will probably pipe up <br>with descriptions of different types of learners -- \n  visual/spatial vs. the <br>other kind -- I can never keep it all straight. \n  <br><br>But it seems like that is part of it to me. <br><br>Background info: \n  &nbsp;I have two children -- a 7 1/2 yo boy and a 6 yo girl. &nbsp;The <br>boy \n  -- I get him -- I see how he thinks -- he hates to write things down -- <br>he \n  does as much as he can in his head -- he likes a clear, straight-forward, \n  <br>cut to the chase answer, he is meticulous, detailed, perfectionist -- he \n  is <br>impatient with slowness of any kind (but very kind on a personal level \n  so <br>that&#39;s sort of misleading) -- but he won&#39;t tolerate any sort of \n  repetition. &nbsp; <br>The girl -- oh my goodness -- where did this child come \n  from!

&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>Anyway, I get him. &nbsp;Most of the time, I have no idea where she is coming \n<br>from. &nbsp;I am really winging it with her!\n<br>\n<br>So, after all that . . . hmmm. &nbsp;Maybe your son needs to de-emphasize to \n<br>himself how important all this memorizing is. &nbsp;If he gets the concepts, and \n<br>he has a calculator, and he just does things for the next few years, these \n<br>facts will be repeated enough times to actually be a part of his memory \n<br>without having to sit down and repeat them a million times. &nbsp;Which isn&#39;t \n<br>going to work too well anyway, imo. &nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>Which reminds me -- what is it that he gets frustrated doing -- games or \n<br>worksheets or what?\n<br>\n<br>Also, one thing we did, if you take a big sheet of the mult tables, and mark \n<br>out the ones he already knows (the 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s, 5s, 10s) and then \n<br>eliminate all the repeats (the good old commutative property) he may be \n<br>suprised to see how much he already knows and how little there is left to \n<br>memorize. &nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>Then, some of the CDs, when set to the right level, will use the higher-end \n<br>problems, and that might be enough repetition to get thru.\n<br>\n<br>Not writing stuff down -- this is my son to a T. &nbsp;(Of course, daughter loves \n<br>to write -- was just this AM writing down a &quot;secret note&quot; about her brother \n<br>-- write crayon on black paper -- very spooky!! ooooooo). &nbsp;So, he doesn&#39;t \n<br>write a lot. &nbsp;And the world keeps turning. &nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>He recently had to do a short essay, for instance, for a Tae Kwon Do test. &nbsp;\n<br>He enjoyed the thinking part and came up with some good ideas but dictated \n<br>what to type to me. &nbsp;If I had insisted that he had to write it by hand, no \n<br>way. &nbsp;We told the TKD teacher this was what we were doing.\n<br>\n<br>Sorry to be so rambling . . \n<br>\n<br>Nance\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></span></blockquote></font></font></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"R Meyers","from":"&quot;R Meyers&quot; &lt;livinglighthouse@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"bWzP3gAc7F7OHPTAeOHQcYLW5yItLbWf4uT-lS2mzmw3BaunNa87V-FoypuCQtff8x52jHwlEZ5DWdqAvqq5av7DqhqRo2JmsbtQT16c","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] math questions...","postDate":"986575831","msgId":18187,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGUwMWMwYmViOSRiMjc0Y2M0MCRjYzM0ODZhY0Bjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDE0LjEyMjU5Zjk4LjI3ZmYzYzBjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":18182,"nextInTopic":18234,"prevInTime":18186,"nextInTime":18188,"topicId":18181,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Math Blaster CDs are a good series of CD-Rom games that offer a lot of drill/practice.
