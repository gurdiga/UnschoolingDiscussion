When I was growing up, <br/>\nmy mom was divorced, working two jobs to support us, and I <br/>\nwatched as much tv as I wanted.  I don&#39;t ever remember being told I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t watch a particular program or that I had been sitting in front <br/>\nof the tv too long.  My favorite programs were The Waltons, Eight is <br/>\nEnough, Marcus Welby M.D. (I&#39;m showing my age now), Love <br/>\nBoat, The Brady Bunch ( I know, I know), but I didn&#39;t have a father <br/>\nor any brothers and sisters, didn&#39;t have a clue what a &quot;normal&quot; <br/>\nfamily was supposed to be like, and was starving for love and <br/>\nattention.  TV filled the void for me, I got from it what I needed.  <br/>\nI also watched lots of gorry murder mysteries.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s the key.  If children are not emotionally needy, they <br/>\naren&#39;t going to cling to it.  Perhaps when they are little, they might <br/>\nwatch lots of it because they are just fascinated, but as they get <br/>\nolder, they find that it doesn&#39;t fill them, because they are already <br/>\nfilled.  And calm down, I&#39;m not saying that if your kids cling to the <br/>\nTV that you are a bad mom, and not meeting your kids emotional <br/>\nneeds.  Sometimes they have needs that aren&#39;t readily apparent, <br/>\nthat we don&#39;t know about.  Observing what they watch may show <br/>\nyou a pattern as to WHY they are watching, what they are trying to <br/>\nget from it.  It could be a useful diagnostic tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even though I watched television constantly as a child (my <br/>\ngrandfather insisted the television HAD to be on all the time, if we <br/>\nturned it off he threw a royal fit) I am very intelligent, went to <br/>\ncollege, got two degrees, and even though I still love tv, it is turned <br/>\noff a large percentage of the time in our home, and it has not <br/>\nstunted my intellectual or emotional growth.  I have a very inquiring <br/>\nmind, read books constantly, and did not become a serial killer <br/>\nbecause I watched violence on tv.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me put in my two cents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJudie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Collette Mattingly","from":"&quot;Collette Mattingly&quot; &lt;collettemattingly@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"BBOyRssTLiP4U40mTcul5gQeEl68yW9tWjFmqBD7_ghGjHYg2zQRz15UgI-xhwII7Y7q-aol79qm_DbkFdPpclnAr51E_KBAXygPowxluJUfChCC549LXA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: About tv limits WAS Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] another tv question","postDate":"985872523","msgId":17456,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOWUwMWMwYjg1NCQyZWIzNzM5MCQ1NDJjMTcxOEBhbnNodW1hbj4=","referencesHeader":"PEY2OUNqV0VGMEhHMGFubHptVVIwMDAwY2MxZUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":17453,"nextInTopic":17465,"prevInTime":17455,"nextInTime":17457,"topicId":17380,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think there is something to the idea that everyone reacts differently to TV.

All the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1938475686\">Hi, I don&#39;t post a whole lot, but I had to respond to this.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease keep in mind that this is my experience only, others may have other<br/>\nstories to tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the research I&#39;ve read all points to the same thing: tv-watching,<br/>\nespecially in the younger children, DOES affect the way their brain<br/>\ndevelops.  In short, it makes them receptors and passive in-takers of<br/>\ninformation, rather than active, analytical, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least that&#39;s my take on what I&#39;ve read lately and admittedly, it&#39;s a<br/>\nsimplistic view of a very complex issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, with my own almost-3yo daughter, when we started limiting her<br/>\ntv-watching to one hour per day or less, within 1 week (really, I&#39;m not<br/>\nexagerating here), we had a calmer child, one who wasn&#39;t bouncing off the<br/>\nwalls all of the time.  We also watched her imagination take flight, because<br/>\nif the tv wasn&#39;t on, she had to entertain herself, and all of a sudden, her<br/>\nanimals had lives and personalities, and she started doing all of the things<br/>\nthe early childhood development books say is normal childhood activities for<br/>\nalmost-3yolds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will also say that part of this, I believe, is not because we turned off<br/>\nthe tv, but because of where she is developmentally, but I think turning off<br/>\nthe tv, and putting a limit on it for Ripley was one of the best things we<br/>\ncould have done as a family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will also say that before we did this, I made sure my art supplies and<br/>\neverything else were all present and accounted for, so that when Ripley<br/>\nasked for the tv, I could present her with other activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the tv.  I like movies.  I like being able to watch stuff both for<br/>\nlearning and for non.  I do not like tv for noise, for companionship, for<br/>\nfiller.  There&#39;s so much to do with other activities and other people!<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I say this is all my own personal experience and opinions, so please<br/>\nkeep that in your mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer, in Fort Worth, it looks like the rain&#39;s stopped again!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17530,"nextTopicId":17626}}
