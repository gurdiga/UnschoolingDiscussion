I&#39;ve missed a few digests as we were away and <br/>\n decided I had too many e-mails to read so deleted a whole bunch... <br/>\n <br/>\n Dawn F<br/>\n Tucson, AZ &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Dawn!  Love and Logic is a type of approach to parenting.  Among us we <br/>\nhave a couple who teaches the concepts and has given some great advice and <br/>\ntips on effectively using the principles of Love and Logic.  The authors of <br/>\nthe Love and Logic approach are Foster Cline, M.D. & Jim Fay.  They have <br/>\nseveral titles that I know are available in the Library.  In a nutshell, this <br/>\napproach to parenting helps the child learn consequences through suitable <br/>\nchoices provided by the parent.   I would encourage you to read back through <br/>\nthe last couple of digest b/c there was some GREAT dialogue on the topic.  <br/>\nApparently, many of us have young children and the info. given was <br/>\ninvaluable.  Thanks  to Carron! <br/>\n<br/>\nCarron -- feel free to elaborate or correct anything I wrote!<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle in DE</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12198,"nextTopicId":12212}}
