It is in the middle of the night though (I have an autistic child which has involved a lot of staying up all night in the past - so we saw a lot of these in recent years). My 7 yr old is an excellent reader, reading things that most of her public schooled peers won&#39;t be reading for MANY years to come, and I really believe that a lot of it is due to her fascination with watching the Electric Company. I really get a kick out of how &#39;politically incorrect&#39; some of these older shows are - it really sticks out when seeing them in the same day as the newer shows.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, in case anyone is interested, you could always set the VCR to record these middle of the night oldies on NOGGIN if you are a &#39;normal&#39; family and not up in the middle of the night like us.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rochester@...\">rochester@...</a><br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\nClick here for the best diet and nutrition information you will ever find!<br/>\nwww.westonaprice.org<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n&quot;I dropped the idea that I was an expert, whose job it was to fill <br/>\nthe little heads with my expertise, and began to explore how I could <br/>\nremove those obstacles that prevented the inherent genius of children <br/>\nfrom gathering itself.&quot;<br/>\n ~~ John Taylor Gatto ~~<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Katedavislawfirm@...\">Katedavislawfirm@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, April 16, 2002 10:48 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Not an unschooler =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hey yoooooou  guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuys!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Does anyone know of anything available today even remotely comparable to <br/>\n  Electric Company?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kate Davis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36971,"nextTopicId":36987}}
