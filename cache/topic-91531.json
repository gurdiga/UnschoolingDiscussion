I have, however, emailed this show to let them know <br/>\njust how upset I was by these comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Hi everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to let the homeschooling public know about a comment I <br/>\nheard on Jay Leno Wednesday, Feb. 25, 2004. He started out speaking <br/>\nabout the teacher who was found nude in her car with her 14 year old <br/>\nstudent. Jay went on to say how &quot;sick&quot; this was. Then he said, &quot;in <br/>\nfact, I can&#39;t think of anything sicker than that except <br/>\nhomeschooling!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t know about you all but I was EXTREMELY offended by this <br/>\ncomment. How dare he compare us to a child molester! I have vowed <br/>\nNEVER to watch his show again unless he makes a public appology for <br/>\nhis demeaning and demoralizing comments. I also think it would be a <br/>\ngood thing for us homeschoolers to encourage Mr. Leno to investigate <br/>\nand learn more about homeschooling and then feature a positive <br/>\nsegment on his show about the benefits of homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like to email Mr. Leno you can do so at tonightshow @ <br/>\nnbc dot com.  I know I will be contacting him shortly.&gt;&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91527,"nextTopicId":91529}}
