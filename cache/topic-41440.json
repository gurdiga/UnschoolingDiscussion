Last year I was in the 10th grade in a <br/>\nMassachusetts pubic school. As some of you may know MA requires public school <br/>\nkids to take a state mandated test called the MCAS (Massachusetts <br/>\ncomprehensive assessment system) in grades 4 6 8 and 10 I believe. Recently a <br/>\nlaw was passed that 10th graders must past the test in order to graduate from <br/>\nhigh school. There are many things wrong with the test and a group of <br/>\nstudents at my school have found the need to actively protest it. This year <br/>\nalong with 10 of my classmates (and others across MA) I participated in <br/>\nboycotting the test. We did just what you mentioned above. On the day of the <br/>\ntest  (after a morning protest with the  students from other grades that <br/>\ndidn&#39;t believe in it, and the 10th graders that also supported the cause but <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t boycott) we went into our assigned  rooms (sporting T-shirts that <br/>\nsaid &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a MCASualty&quot;) and sat down we waited patiently while <br/>\nthe proctor explained the directions and filled our names in. then when the <br/>\nproctor said &quot;you may begin&quot; we got up from our seats put our tests down on  <br/>\nthe desk and said &quot;I&#39;m not taking this&quot; to which we received wicked applause <br/>\nfrom the others in the room. (The proctor knew in advance that we weren&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to take it.) we walked out into the hall and met up with the other <br/>\nboycotters from the other rooms  then we held hands and walked out the front <br/>\ndoor of our school ceremoniously snapping our number two pencils in half we <br/>\nwere greeted by the former boycotters, parents, press and other supporters. <br/>\nright now as it stands the 10 of us (plus the boycotters from the previous <br/>\nyear who are now seniors)  wont be graduating, ( which is why I&#39;m on the <br/>\nunschooling list) but I wouldn&#39;t change what I did for anything.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41603,"nextTopicId":41477}}
