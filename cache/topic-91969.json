She had her natural delivery <br/>\non the 9th,  but things didn&#39;t go well.   Baby wasn&#39;t breathing <br/>\nafter the delivery and Shyrley lost lots of blood.  :(<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were both rushed to the hospital.   Shyrley ended up with some <br/>\ninfections, but got to come home this afternoon.   Baby, Celyn, <br/>\nisn&#39;t doing as well.  She has brain damage.  :(   She is breathing <br/>\non her on now,  but they think she possibly has Cerebral Palsy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo,  keep Shyrley and her baby in your thoughts.  If anyone wants <br/>\nmore info,  you can e-mail me off list.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91963,"nextTopicId":91955}}
