I hope none of you are.  This is <br/>\ncommentary on that same list of coke-uses and abuses:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.snopes2.com/cokelore/acid.htm\">http://www.snopes2.com/cokelore/acid.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOrigins: Â  Many of the entries above are just simple household tips involving <br/>\nCoca-Cola. That you can cook and clean with Coke is relatively meaningless <br/>\nfrom a safety standpoint -- you can use a wide array of common household <br/>\nsubstances (including water) for the same purposes; that doesn&#39;t necessarily <br/>\nmake them dangerous. The fact is that all carbonated soft drinks contain <br/>\ncarbonic acid, which is moderately useful for tasks such as removing stains <br/>\nand dissolving rust deposits (although plain soda water is much better for <br/>\nsuch purposes than Coca-Cola or other soft drinks, as it doesn&#39;t leave a <br/>\nsticky sugar residue behind). Carbonic acid is relatively weak, however, and <br/>\npeople have been drinking carbonated water for many years with no detrimental <br/>\neffects. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the claims offered here are, in a word, stupid. Coca-Cola does <br/>\ncontain small amounts of citric acid (from the orange, lemon, and lime oils <br/>\nin its formula) and phosphoric acid. However, all the insinuations about the <br/>\ndangers these acids might pose to people who drink Coca-Cola ignore a simple <br/>\nconcept familiar to any first-year chemistry student: concentration. <br/>\nCoca-Cola contains less citric acid than orange juice does, and the <br/>\nconcentration of phosphoric acid in Coke is far too small (a mere 11 to 13 <br/>\ngrams per gallon of syrup, or about 0.20 to 0.30 per cent of the total <br/>\nformula) to harm anyone, no matter how much Coke he guzzles. The only people <br/>\nwho proffer the ridiculous statements that Coca-Cola will dissolve a steak, a <br/>\ntooth, or a nail in a matter of days are people who have never actually tried <br/>\nany of these things, because they just don&#39;t happen. (Anyone who conducts <br/>\nthese experiments will find himself at the end of two days with a whole <br/>\ntooth, a whole nail, and one very soggy t-bone.) <br/>\n<br/>\nThe next time you&#39;re stopped by a highway patrolman, try asking him if he&#39;s <br/>\never cleaned blood stains off a highway with Coca-Cola. If you&#39;re lucky, by <br/>\nthe time he stops laughing he&#39;ll have forgotten about the citation he was <br/>\ngoing to give you.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15884,"nextTopicId":15984}}
