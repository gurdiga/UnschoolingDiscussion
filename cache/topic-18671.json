One of my favorite things about the SCA has <br/>\nalways been that it&#39;s something singles or couples or families or one member <br/>\nof a family or teens can do.  Almost every other organization is designed FOR <br/>\nteens, or single adults, or couples, or whatever.  But in this one, it&#39;s the <br/>\nactivities and projects which are the focus, not the kind of people doing <br/>\nthem.  The only requirements (besides wearing costumes and behaving as ladies <br/>\nand gentlement) are the interest learning about history.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI knew a homeschooling family (met through e-mail homeschooling discussions <br/>\nyears ago) and their kids were the same ages as mine, and they took their <br/>\nkids to events, and we did too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference was the mother was a very structured homeschooler.  Structured <br/>\nabout everything in her kids&#39; lives--hair, dress, food, bedtime.  We got <br/>\ntogether three different times, and the differences in our homeschooling was <br/>\nstriking.  The mom became my apprentice within the SCA.  She learned FAST <br/>\n(not everything from me, for sure)--recorder, weaving, costuming, calligraphy <br/>\nand illumination.  She devoured this stuff, was good.   I suggested that her <br/>\nkids could learn the same say as people learn in the SCA, and she rejected <br/>\neven thinking about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe in part it was social.  Take what you will from this, but she lived <br/>\nin southern Illinois at the time, and went to a fundamentalist church.   <br/>\nThere are parts of the country (the south, sometimes the northeast) where <br/>\nthere seems to be much age-based prejudice.  I think it must be harder in <br/>\nsome social settings than others to let teens play SCA or to let kids decide <br/>\nwhat to eat.

I go to arts events <br/>\n(while he stays with kids) and he goes to wars and tournaments.  Sometimes we <br/>\nget someone to stay with kids so we can go to something together (especially <br/>\nwhen we&#39;re singing).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt camping events, we have often arranged to have something in our camp <br/>\n(music, philosophy discussion, some campfire-thing) so the kids can be asleep <br/>\nand we can hear them if they wake up.  This coming Grand Outlandish <br/>\nTournament (Memorial Day) we&#39;ll have the big bardic circle (storytelling, <br/>\nsinging) in our camp.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have also hired babysitters (after a fashion) at the events--arranged for <br/>\na young teen girl to hang out with the youngest child, make sure they have <br/>\nwater (our most important thing when camping in New Mexico and hereabout) and <br/>\nsunscreen and food and something to do for some block of time, in exchange <br/>\nfor money to spend at the merchants, or for some other thing the kid wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite thing about it all is the people my kids get to know through the <br/>\ngroup, and the things they get to see.  Holly&#39;s godfather is Sir Raymond the <br/>\nQuiet, an armorer, jewelrymaker, publisher.  Marty&#39;s is Duke Artan MacAilin, <br/>\na man of great honor and thoughtfulness.  Kirby&#39;s is now deceased, but he <br/>\nstudied Japanese swordsmanship (was a black belt in a couple of martial forms <br/>\noutside the SCA) and culture.  At events the kids get to interact as people, <br/>\nnot &quot;as kids,&quot; and they get to do real, useful work alongside adults they <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t otherwise meet.  So as your kids get older, I recommend taking them <br/>\n(or as soon and as often as you can stand to, if they enjoy it).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"UDcLT_6PzYqwYwJzVqsKGl-kmy6hos2Mb5FyEzzKfM9I3WfpHFSxoAUMVXtEQa_gpy0L_jgkB8QF","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] SCA questions","postDate":"987313635","msgId":18671,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYyLmRiNjRjMjAuMjgwYThmZTNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":18727,"prevInTime":18669,"nextInTime":18672,"topicId":18671,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/14/01 10:07:24 PM, crma@ix.netcom.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-780858954\">In a message dated 4/14/01 10:07:24 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I am assuming that you are talking about the SCA here.
