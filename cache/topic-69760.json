My daughter, OTOH, creates with abandon.<br/>\nOne thing that really helped here is when I became more conscious about my<br/>\nkids seeing *me* make mistakes. More specifically, once I started working on<br/>\nmy novel, my son asked to sit with me while I was reading it out loud and<br/>\nediting it. He was amazed at *how many* &quot;mistakes&quot; I had made that I needed<br/>\nto change. We had some long conversations about what it means to truly do<br/>\nsomething and how even famous people like writers, painters, and scientists<br/>\nrarely get something right the first time around. It takes repeated trials,<br/>\nerrors, and efforts. After that, something seemed to loosen inside him and<br/>\nhe became a prolific writer, even though his handwriting is all over the<br/>\nplace and his spelling is largely phonetic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  However, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;having a hard time seeing this in my child because (in retrospect) I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;learned that &quot;perfect&quot; is not really (IMO) attainable or desirable.  Is<br/>\n&gt;there any way to reassure him that just &quot;doing your best&quot; is all we can<br/>\n&gt;do in life?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe look for less ways to tell him that, and more ways to show him. I<br/>\nthink to kids it must look as if adults can just do everything perfectly the<br/>\nfirst time. Rarely do they get to see us struggle, make mistakes, get back<br/>\nup and try again. By the time they&#39;re born, we can usually already do most<br/>\nthings that we need to, and we tend to stick inside our comfort zones. So<br/>\nI&#39;d say, take a risk and do something with him or near him that you&#39;ve never<br/>\ndone before. Bake a souffle&#39;, write a haiku, take up an instrument you don&#39;t<br/>\nknow, rent some rollerblades or skis and let him see you fall on your butt<br/>\n(literally or figuratively)!<br/>\nI remember the day my kids watched me do a triathlon for the first time (the<br/>\nfirst time they watched, not the first one I did). They saw a volunteer hang<br/>\na &quot;finisher&#39;s medal&quot; around my neck (which all races seem to give out now,<br/>\nharrumph, but that&#39;s another rant about why adults can&#39;t just do something<br/>\nfor the sake of doing it and not a prize). Anyways, they started screaming<br/>\n&quot;You won mom! You won!&quot; and I had to explain to them that I didn&#39;t actually<br/>\nwin. That led to a rather lengthy discussion about why I would do the race<br/>\nif I wasn&#39;t going to win, what winning really meant, how I defined success,<br/>\netc.<br/>\nAnother example: one thing I like about the Suzuki method of violin, which<br/>\nthe kids are taking right now, is that they encourage parents to learn<br/>\nalongside their kids. Wow, talk about getting perspective on just how hard<br/>\nit is. When you&#39;re screeching and scratching your way through Twinkle,<br/>\nTwinkle Little Star, you get a lot of insight into how hard *everything* is<br/>\nfor kids. We adults should do more of that kind of thing--put ourselves in<br/>\nthe position to learn something totally new and remember just how danged<br/>\nhard it is! I have done a fair bit of teaching of various things to<br/>\nadults--computers, skydiving, swimming to adult non-swimmers, and the single<br/>\ngreatest thing to get past for all of them is the fear of making mistakes.<br/>\nAs adults, it has had years to be ingrained deeply. The further we can go<br/>\nnow toward making sure our kids know that making mistakes *is how we learn<br/>\nanything*, the better off they&#39;ll be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Also, how do you all handle &quot;schoolish&quot; lingo with the littler ones?<br/>\n&gt; What I mean is the &quot;age/grade level&quot; that workbooks, games and<br/>\n&gt;activities put on their products and things like that.  I&#39;m having<br/>\n&gt;difficulty explaining that it&#39;s all arbitrary, but DS is taking it<br/>\n&gt;literally and seems to be really focusing on these labels.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, first off I&#39;d examine how he heard about it in the first place. Ask<br/>\nhim where the context is coming from. Or if you provided that context in the<br/>\nfirst place, examine why/how you did that. Most 4 year olds wouldn&#39;t know<br/>\nabout age or grade levels unless someone told them. When my son has asked<br/>\n&quot;Why does this Lego box say &quot;8 and up&quot;, I just tell him the truth: for some<br/>\ncrazy reason, our society requires them to do that, but it&#39;s totally<br/>\nmeaningless. If you can, maybe just offer to make him some workbooks at<br/>\nhome. Avoid going down the aisle in the store that has the workbooks unless<br/>\nhe asks to. My son used to love it when I made up worksheets for him. I&#39;d<br/>\ndraw silly pictures and it would become an interactive activity. Disclaimer:<br/>\nHe totally asked for this, after seeing workbooks in a store. I have *never*<br/>\nrequired him to do workbooks on any subject. He does like them though.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s a few things that have really helped around here. I&#39;ve seen my<br/>\nson&#39;s perfectionism really back off in the last couple of years, and I think<br/>\nit was a combination of things that did it (including just getting older, of<br/>\ncourse). Your child is four, right? Four is probably a hard age for kids.<br/>\nThey&#39;re old enough to know the vast scope of things they might be able to<br/>\ndo, but young enough so that it might seem to them that they haven&#39;t<br/>\nmastered very many, and all of them are still very difficult.

It&#39;s <br/>\njust an overall personality trait. We can certainly make it worse, or <br/>\ntry to ease it a little, but I think it&#39;s one of those things that is <br/>\njust a part of who we are. Some of us get it way worse than others. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Now he&#39;s doing this sort of thing with writing.

I&#39;m struggling to find the words to reassure him <br/>\nthat -he&#39;ll learn- to read not by me &quot;teaching&quot; him but just because <br/>\nhe wants to learn and he&#39;ll pick it up.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell you can teach him what he wants to learn without setting up a <br/>\nfull-time reading curriculum for him. He&#39;s asking to learn. Go for <br/>\nit! Make it a game. Make labels for things for around the house and <br/>\nsee how many he can stick on the right object in 1 minute. Switch <br/>\nthem around and see how quickly he can get the labels back on the <br/>\nright item. Play word concentration. Play with word families. Write <br/>\nhim simple little notes. Do as much as he wants and stop when he&#39;s <br/>\nseems &quot;full.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;DS also *begs* for workbooks when we&#39;re at the bookstore and is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>very interested in knowing what &quot;grade level&quot; they are. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCasey used to love workbooks. She still does them a bit now and then. <br/>\nShe loved knowing the grade levels too. We&#39;d just make it a kind of <br/>\njoke though. She plays games that range from ages 3 to adult. She <br/>\ndoes workbooks and plays computer games that are all over the grade <br/>\nlevels. Just by experiencing how arbitrary those &quot;standards&quot; are, she <br/>\nhas seen for herself that they&#39;re meaningless in her world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Is there any way to reassure him that just &quot;doing your best&quot; is all <br/>\n </span></blockquote>we can do in life?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can and should reassure him lots. There&#39;s no way to *make* him <br/>\nbelieve it though. He needs more life experience. I believe we *get <br/>\nit* by living it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; How can I be there for him and help him to work through his <br/>\n </span></blockquote>frustrations without imposing my own wishes or solutions on him?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll have to live it too. See what works. Judge for yourself when <br/>\nyou think he&#39;s looking for help and when he needs you to back off. <br/>\nYou&#39;ll find your rhythm.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t want them to live in someone else&#39;s &quot;box&quot; but to be able to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>follow their own paths.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe grade level stuff is really not so all powerful when they&#39;re not <br/>\nin school. They hear it and maybe compare to an extent, but it desn&#39;t <br/>\ndefine them. They are already living outside the box and following <br/>\ntheir own path.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69983,"nextTopicId":70021}}
