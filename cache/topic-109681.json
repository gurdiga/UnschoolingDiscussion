The forest is made up of<br/>\nindividual, living, growing trees, not one kind of tree at one stage of<br/>\ngrowth.   Without the trees there is no forest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWithout the individual stories of how unschooling children learn there is<br/>\nno whole of unschooling.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would participate in good faith and ask honest questions you&#39;d<br/>\nfind the list members here very generous.

This is a list for unschoolers to discuss the<br/>\nphilosophy in order to apply it&#39;s principles more deeply in their lives. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be very ill mannered to go to a vegetarian list and tell the<br/>\nmembers they&#39;re sheltered because they don&#39;t know a whole world of tasty<br/>\ncritters exists out there.

They&#39;re unschoolers because they know all too well the other<br/>\nviews.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read at your e-mail list and it&#39;s very clear you know almost nothing<br/>\nabout unschooling.

Do you think we don&#39;t live<br/>\nin the world, and see kids going off to school<br/>\neveryday, and hear about how great school is and<br/>\nhow necessary formal education is to the<br/>\nwell-being of our children? Believe me, all of us<br/>\nare well aware of exactly what the alternatives<br/>\nto unschooling are. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe deliberately chose to read this list as one<br/>\namong many sources of information we have about<br/>\neducation, in order to receive more information<br/>\nand support for our decision to unschool our<br/>\nchildren.

We&#39;re not<br/>\nhere to read about how great formal education is<br/>\n-- we can read about that anywhere. It&#39;s just not<br/>\nin the scope of this list to talk about that, any<br/>\nmore than it&#39;s in the scope of Popular Science to<br/>\ndiscuss the value of creationism. It&#39;s an<br/>\neditorial decision for the listowners to exclude<br/>\nthose kinds of posts, not an attempt at<br/>\ncensorship.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!
