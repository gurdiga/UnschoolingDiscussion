I might even forget about the<br/>\n&gt;project, and in<br/>\n&gt;so doing, lose out on a great lesson.  Could the<br/>\n&gt;child have  a space (their room, a spot in the<br/>\n&gt;basement, a converted closet, etc.) where they are<br/>\n&gt;free to treat their *own* belongings in a way that is<br/>\n&gt;appropriate for them?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>These are not projects, I let my kids keep train sets,<br/>\nblock castles, blanket forts, and other things of that<br/>\nnature up for days on end.  My older son, Thomas, does<br/>\nnot get involved in elaborate, multi-stage projects<br/>\nthough.  The train sets and other constructions are<br/>\nusually his little brother&#39;s.  Thomas often spends<br/>\ntime involved talking to and with his toys in<br/>\nimaginary scenarios, but these are very portable.  He<br/>\nis hyperactive and lacks even the patience to do a<br/>\nsimple board puzzle.  It is something we are working<br/>\non.  Thomas is extremely intelligent and articulate,<br/>\nbut high strung, emotional and hyper.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I was referring to is that when he is looking for<br/>\nan item, in a toy chest or bin, he usually<br/>\ndumps/empties the entire contents onto the floor to<br/>\nfind the one or two items he is interested in, and<br/>\nthen walks away and leaves the pile.  Some days he<br/>\nwill do this with almost every container in his room,<br/>\ncreating a huge chaos of people and animal figures,<br/>\nvehicles, gadgets, blocks, beanies and bric-a-brac.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe leave it for while to see if he shows any interest<br/>\nin picking up, but these are not piles that he plays<br/>\nwith.  He retrieves what he wants and is done with<br/>\nthem.  We gently remind, we ask, we show, we offer to<br/>\nhelp.  Often we have to take his chin and reiterate<br/>\nseveral times while he is watching us speak, what it<br/>\nis that he is expected to do, in clear simple terms. <br/>\nWe line his bins up on the floor, one for people, one<br/>\nfor animals, etc, with pictures on the front to show<br/>\nwhat goes in each.  We ask him to &quot;Pick up all the<br/>\nanimals please&quot; and we assist some and help get him<br/>\nback on track when he strays from task (which is<br/>\noften).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever his response to this is occassionally to fall<br/>\nonto the floor and scream &quot;uh-uh!!  No!&quot;  When no<br/>\namount of coaxing or insisting will get him involved<br/>\n(we do not threaten or bribe) then we are forced to<br/>\ntake other actions to save the floor, our sanity,<br/>\nprevent injury and prevent destruction of all the<br/>\ntoys.  We warm him what will happen if we have to pick<br/>\nthem up ourselves, when he has made the mess.  Some<br/>\ndays he just does not care.  In those cases, we pick<br/>\nup for him, but the toys go into time out for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have elimated clutter by organizing his toys, taken<br/>\nout extra messy items to his non-hyper brother&#39;s room,<br/>\nand made his room as simple as possible in terms of<br/>\ncleaning/mess/stimulation.  He has six small bins (two<br/>\nsets of three pull out drawers), one small table top<br/>\nbin with coloring books and puzzles, one medium bin<br/>\nwith a lid for beanies, one small toy chest for<br/>\nmiscellaneous larger items, a toy castle and pirate<br/>\nship, a large magnadoodle, and a couple of other<br/>\nitems.  That is all that is in his room aside from his<br/>\nbed, and a play table with two chairs and a few things<br/>\non the upper closet shelf.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He used to have the kids&#39; book<br/>\n&gt;&gt;collection in his room, but whenever he got mad, he<br/>\n&gt;&gt;would sweep clear the shelves into a big pile and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;refuse to pick them up later<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I think if my &gt;child was showing this type of anger<br/>\n </span></blockquote>or sadness, I &gt;would offer a pillow to kick, an animal<br/>\nto throw, an &gt;old plate to smash safely, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your concern, but we have been to family<br/>\ntherapy, play therapy and parenting classes.  He has a<br/>\nnumber of options that are allowed for expressing his<br/>\nanger/frustration, and is encouraged to use his very<br/>\nextensive vocabulary to explain his feelings.  The<br/>\ndumping of the books was engineered to garner a<br/>\nsatifyingly (to him) reaction from mom and dad, who do<br/>\nnot like books mishandled, no matter how we try to<br/>\nremain calm about it.  Removing them to his brother&#39;s<br/>\nroom has solved that problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I don&#39;t want to dissuade him from using his creativity to<br/>\nbuild, etc, but I do want to keep peace in the family.  Any help<br/>\nappreciated, thanks<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette, in Indiana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have been<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hammering and sawing and I am always surprised with what they come up<br/>\n </span></blockquote>with.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Seems like there are always projects going on here.

Emily","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1007222426\">Yesterday was one of those days where I felt like we had a &quot;good&quot; unschooling day.  And it didn&#39;t require a special field trip or special materials...<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily had been running a fever for a couple of days, so we were going to take her to the doctor in the morning (we were suspecting a sinus infection).  But before we left, I remembered I had even forgotten to check her forehead... she felt cooler... took her temp and it was 98.,8.  She felt fine, so we canceled the appt. and decided we&#39;d go to piano lessons instead (we had had to cancel those for the dr. visit).  I wasn&#39;t able to reach her piano teacher before we left, so I left a message and forwarded calls to the cell phone in case she called back.  We hopped into the already warmed up car and made a stop at the post office on the way.  Usually, we drop Emily off for her hour-long lesson, while the other kids and I drive around or go shopping.  Since we were about 15-20 minutes late this time, we decided we&#39;d all stay.  Emily was very excited to show Miss Kate a new song she was composing (her teacher really encourages her composition).  Instead of a formal lesson, they spent the next 30 minutes or so transcribing Emily&#39;s music on staff paper.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter lessons, the kids were asking for French fries from McDonald&#39;s. I told Emily how much cash I had on me and she figured up whether I had enough to get some for everyone (not before asking if I could just use my credit card... LOL).  We came home and ate our fries, then she set to work cleaning her room and putting away her clean laundry.  At one point she came down and said, &quot;I&#39;ve been listening to &#39;NSYNC while I&#39;m working and do you know on one song they say the word &#39;love&#39; 37 times??&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe baby had been napping, but after he woke up and nursed, we went upstairs to finish helping Emily with her room.  We sorted out some clothes that were getting too small, and talked about a friend who was having a labor induction yesterday.  Talked about pitocin, oxytocin, contractions... Em was trying on a shirt to see if it was too small and remarked that she thought she would need a bra within a year...  I told her she might be right. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce her room was done, she came downstairs and watched some Animal Planet... waiting for her friend across the street (also homeschooled, but not unschooled) to finish school so she could come over.  I had some new software I got from UnbeatableDeals.com and called her in to see it.  We set up Mavis Beacon teaches typing and she did a few lessons, stopping after she had learned the home row and the letters &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot;.  Her avg. speed was 11WPM.  Then she gave Gizmos and Gadgets a try for a while, until her dad got home from work.  Her friend showed up just as we were getting ready to go out to dinner, so we invited her along.  Ate at Golden Corral buffet, where the kids got to make their own choices and all did a good job of choosing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize I haven&#39;t mentioned the 5yo and 2yo much...  they spent most of the day playing different things..  puzzles, a matching game, etc.  They watched some tv, we read books together.  The 5yo noticed some dry skin where he had gotten a sunburn last week during our warm spell.  So we talked about why his skin was peeling there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s about it... no earth-shattering observations, no special trips or deep mysteries of life solved... just a rather boringly normal day, but still a learning day.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\nMama to Emily (12/91), Noah (12/95), Halle (10/98), and Joel (9/00)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/heartland/2358\">http://www.geocities.com/heartland/2358</a><br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:careermom@...\">careermom@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19170,"nextTopicId":19172}}
