Fundamentalists aren&#39;t afraid of <br/>\nhomosexuality. They think it is sinful, immoral behavior. That <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean they are &quot;homophobic&quot; but that they have a <br/>\nreligious reason for opposing it.

In fact, the more fundamentalist, the more <br/>\nunschooling these families become but for entirely different <br/>\nreasons. It&#39;s odd actually. The biggest proponents of the <br/>\nunschooling lifestyle that I encountered before this group were <br/>\nhardcore fundamentalist Christians. The educational system is <br/>\nsuspect to them and they put high value on living a life of actual <br/>\nlearning rather than school so that each peson can become fully <br/>\nthe peson God intended rather than what the system intends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are lots of conservative Christians who don&#39;t <br/>\nunschool, don&#39;t agree with unschooling and don&#39;t understand <br/>\nunschooling.

Just like they will form their <br/>\ndescriptions of you and homosexuals based on their encounters <br/>\nand interpretations. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think we owe it to people to try to understand the ideas behind <br/>\nthese viewpoints and why they believe what they hold to be true <br/>\nmakes sense. Most people see themselves as good, consistent <br/>\nand loving (on all sides of each debate). Why do people think <br/>\nthat way about themselves when other groups see them as <br/>\nhostile, undermining and cruel?
