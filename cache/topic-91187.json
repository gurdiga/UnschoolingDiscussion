I didn&#39;t begin to recover until they brought my parents in the see me because I was still failing even though the surgery was considered a success. They didn&#39;t understand it, but chalked it up to my prematurity. My mom spoke to me, but my vitals stayed the same. When my dad spoke to me AND reached in through the isolette to stroke my forehead with his finger (they totally freaked because while he&#39;d scrubbed, he wasn&#39;t gloved!!) my vitals started to improve. Interestingly, I&#39;m much closer to my father than my mother so I&#39;m somewhat fascinated by the way that happened. I literally have my Dad&#39;s blood in me as they used him to give me a direct transfusion at one point because we are the same blood type (gosh medicine is facsinating!!!). <br/>\n <br/>\nI think though, that I would have been more &quot;whole&quot; if it hadn&#39;t been for growing up with an emotionally distant mother and not being able to see my father because of their divorce. Nor was I ever really allowed to discuss my twin nor how I felt living without her. It wasn&#39;t until I grew up that I realized how much that affected me...for example, I tend to collect things related to activities I&#39;m involved in and mementos and such in direct consequence of that denial of my twin. By denying her existence, they denied a part of me. I&#39;ve always been scared that if something happened to me, there would be nobody to mourn me, nobody to know who I was, etc. so I&#39;ve always wanted to be sure I leave things behind for my children and grandchildren if not further generations to be able to know me and that I existed. <br/>\n <br/>\nThose things, along with some childhood sexual abuse from a babysitter&#39;s son and an inability to trust that if I told my mother she&#39;d believe me and protect me, did more to developing the panic disorder than simply the surgery I think. Not that it didn&#39;t have a huge part, but I really think if the rest had been there, I may not have developed the panic attacks. It just happened that they manifested most in a remembrance of that surgery, a time of ultimate pain and alone-ness.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think no matter what a child may go through, if their parents are there with them and truly loving and supportive, protective and believing the child, they will be whole.<br/>\n <br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan Gallien &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:susan@...\">susan@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nThanks Elizabeth, <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was pregnant with my last baby and had a fear of premature birth due to a placenta previa I read a lot about premature babies and their treatment.

Seven years ago it went away, and all because I found out why I had them.  At age 9 months old I had crawled out into the garden with my 4 year old brother who was playing in the snow, he had dug a tunnel and I went into it, and it promptly collapsed.  The way he tells it he was digging franticly to get me out and then our mother who had been in the bathroom [nature even calls good mothers]  came looking for me.  They finally dug me out but apparently I was buried for over 10 minutes.  Mom never told me about it and I don&#39;t know why... maybe another of her anger things at my brother who provided me with one of my earliest memories... tumbling down cement stairs in my pram and putting my teeth through my lip.  Another thing my Mother didn&#39;t tell me about, I asked her about it when I was about 14, she was stunned that I remembered it since I was 13 months old at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have memories of being bounced up and down on a grey trousered leg, by my Daddy [he died three days after I turned 3], and of my brother and I  hiding behind Daddy&#39;s big chair and taking turns pulling the hair on his arms, he would in mock horror grab the little offender, of course leaving his other arm ready for the other villain to pull the hair on.  I can still see the way the skin would stand up as I pulled the individual hairs, and still see his face as he grabbed for me as I ran away.  Eventually he would chase one of us and we&#39;d all end up in a laughing pile on the floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember my Father&#39;s Mother babysitting me while we listened to my Mother sing on the radio, when I told my Mother that one she said that I was 2.5 when that happened.  That&#39;s close to the extent of my English memories.. that and a feeling of great sadness when we left.  I didn&#39;t know till years later that my Father&#39;s family had tried to kidnap my brother and I to get Mom to stay there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSue Gallien<br/>\nThe Winona Farm, Minnesota<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thewinonafarm.com\">http://thewinonafarm.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Elizabeth Roberts <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, February 20, 2004 8:48 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I agree.

In my experience <br/>\nstillness at least is VITAL for learning, though seldom memorable. Maybe even a <br/>\nbit of boredom is useful now and then (but it would be awful to use this as <br/>\njustification for lousy unschooling.)<br/>\n<br/>\n      I don&#39;t remember how I learned to read. There was no big event that <br/>\nprecipitated my learning to read, write, or speak (or think for that matter -- <br/>\nand it&#39;s all ongoing I suppose). <br/>\n<br/>\n       Don&#39;t remember a single reading teacher I ever had or any memorable <br/>\n&quot;aha&quot; moment whatsoever, although I do vividly remember one night figuring out <br/>\nhow to say the alphabet backwards, while lying in the dark during years of <br/>\ntoo-early bedtimes. From that night to this day, I can recite it perfectly and <br/>\nhave had much fun with it, because of boredom AND stillness. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n       Come to think of it, I have no memory of how either of our children <br/>\nlearned to read -- except that stillness was an important part of it. They don&#39;t <br/>\nremember it either. They also don&#39;t remember now-deceased grandparents who <br/>\nloved and nurtured them (in many long afternoons of stillness, possibly even <br/>\nboredom) Does that prove they learned nothing from those relationships and the <br/>\nquiet time they filled in their lives?<br/>\n<br/>\n       Eight-year-old DS doesn&#39;t even remember some very emotional moments <br/>\nlike his own near- drowning or our car accident, or the family dog we had until <br/>\nhe was four that we had to put down because he started snapping at DS. Also, <br/>\nsome of his best ideas spring from stillness, if not boredom. (Of course we <br/>\nstrew and converse and stimulate around here, but not to stave off stillness.)<br/>\n<br/>\n        In music, the rests are just as important as the notes played to the <br/>\nintegrity of the whole experience. Not ever noticed, or remembered or <br/>\ncommented on, but essential. Like contemplation and sleep are to learning, maybe? <br/>\n<br/>\n       And think of all we&#39;d miss if we noticed only punctuation marks!<br/>\n<br/>\n       What we subjectively recall as learning moments are only the barest <br/>\nsketch of what we learned and how we learned it.
