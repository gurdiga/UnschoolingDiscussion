If so, <br/>\nthen I know she will have a great safe adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be important to keep someone informed on her whereabouts <br/>\nonce she gets there.  So if something happens, NOT  THAT IT WILL AND IS VERY <br/>\nUNLIKELY, but it is better than having the whole country to look for her.  It <br/>\nis a great way to avoiding a iternary, but still have some safety, keeping <br/>\nyou informed on her trip, and give you peace of mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow exciting for her?
