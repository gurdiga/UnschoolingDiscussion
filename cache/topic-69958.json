Well, actually he&#39;s now <br/>\nat work but he made it back.  I am truly hopeless when it comes to reading a <br/>\nmap.  I&#39;m getting better though so maybe there&#39;s a ray of hope there <br/>\nsomewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good thing about him getting lost is he now knows EXACTLY where the <br/>\nconference and the hotel are! LOL  And I could probably navigate Columbia <br/>\nhaving never even been there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69827,"nextTopicId":69436}}
