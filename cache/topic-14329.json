I think elections are great training grounds for research skills and<br/>\nlearning about history.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last twelve years there has been lots of stuff out there about the<br/>\nvarious folks in political office.  Quayle gave reporters enough material to<br/>\nlast them for years.  The comic book about Bush and Quayle when they ran<br/>\nagainst Clinton was quite a hoot.  Clinton and all his picadillos have kept<br/>\nthe press busy.  BUT, never in the history of the U.S. has more negative<br/>\npublicity been generated by the presence of one person than has happened in<br/>\nthe less than four week since the election.  Third World countries are<br/>\nmaking jokes about Dubya, the media is having a heyday.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, following the house rule of &quot;get the facts, digest the facts, make a<br/>\ndecision,&quot; (one of the joys of unschooling!) the kidlets decided to do a web<br/>\nsearch and then did research at the library.  Then they did a math thingy<br/>\n(several graphes and pie charts, etc.) and then extended their charts to the<br/>\nyear 2004.  The projection is that by the time Dubya leaves the White House,<br/>\nif he&#39;s ever officially elected, he will have generated more negative<br/>\npublicity for the U.S. than Quayle, Clinton and all prior elections and<br/>\npoliticians combined.  Well, I questioned there numbers because we are<br/>\ntalking a phenominal number by the end of 2004 and it came back to bite me<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey finished their little &quot;study&quot; on Thursday and what should arrive in the<br/>\nmail on Friday but a Christmas card with a hohoho inside (thank you,<br/>\nyou-know-who &lt;g&gt;, hubby is hanging it at the top of our Christmas card tree<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;).  First thing eldest kidlet said was &quot;See!&quot;  Here&#39;s the &quot;gift&quot; from<br/>\ninside the card, a seed packet which reads:<br/>\n<br/>\nBUSHLEAGUE SEED CO.<br/>\n*TEXAS* HOMEGROWN DOPE<br/>\n<br/>\n[Goofy looking cartoon drawing of Dubya in a pot of weed]<br/>\n<br/>\nPlanting Instructions:  Usinga silver spoon, plant in shallow hole. Protect<br/>\nfrom draft.  Feed with loads of family and soft money.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe back reads:<br/>\n<br/>\nTEXAS HOMEGROWN (legalized) DOPE<br/>\nAn ornamental shrub developed to protect corporate boardrooms and gated<br/>\ncommunities.<br/>\n<br/>\nWHERE TO PLANT:  Grows easily in poor environment; oblivious to air or water<br/>\nquality, and unaffected by chemical or radioactive contamination.<br/>\n<br/>\nRECOMMENDED PLANTING DEPTH:  Extremely shallow.<br/>\n<br/>\nDAYS TO MATURITY:  When Mommy and Poppy say so.<br/>\n<br/>\nWHEN TO PLANT:  Whenever migrant labor is available.<br/>\n<br/>\nCARE:  Thrives with lack of illumination.  Protect from pests such as single<br/>\nworking mothers and investigative reporters.  Feed with special interest<br/>\nfundraisers until firmly rooted in the Public Treasury.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis Dope provides short term euphoria with big tax breaks for the rich.<br/>\nLong term side effects could include fiscal pain, swelling welfare rolls,<br/>\nand an increase in death by lethal injection.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\nIf Ignorance Is Bliss Why Aren&#39;t More People Happy?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14314,"nextTopicId":3201}}
