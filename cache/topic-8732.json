It&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; tangy like the Hain vegan mayonnaise. It&#39;s very mild=at least we think so.<br/>\n&gt; When we make our own, we use this recipe:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tofu Mayonnaise:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3/4 cup soft or medium tofu (the best kind to use for this is by Mori<br/>\n&gt; Nu-usually found in the Asian grocery section doesn&#39;t have to be chilled)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2 tbsp lemon juice OR vinegar<br/>\n&gt; 1/2 tsp salt<br/>\n&gt; dash of pepper (optional-I don&#39;t use it)<br/>\n&gt; 2 tbsp oil<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a blender or food processor (I use my food processor) blend together on<br/>\n&gt; high, the tofu, lemon juice, salt, pepper-if using, and oil until thick and<br/>\n&gt; creamy. Adjust any ingredients for desired taste. Store in the refrigerator<br/>\n&gt; in a clean, dry container with a tight fitting lid. Will keep for 7-10 days.<br/>\n&gt; Makes about 1 1/2 cups.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, let me know if there are any other things you are trying to use vegan<br/>\n&gt; replacements for. I have so many recipes that it would be impossible for me<br/>\n&gt; to send them all.
