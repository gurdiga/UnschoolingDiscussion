I am embarrassed that I <br/>\naccidentally brought Makana into this. She is such a sweetheart, and <br/>\nhas her hands full at the moment. I really will calm down <br/>\nnow because I finally see that there are those who think one thing, and <br/>\nthose who think something else, and that is very normal. The folks who <br/>\nquestioned my character on this public forum <br/>\nhave revealed theirs as well, and that&#39;s ok. We are all different. Good <br/>\nthing too. How boring it would be to have everyone agree with you all <br/>\nthe time, and not question anything. Or even <br/>\nworse to assume that they themselves are wrong about what they think <br/>\nbecause they &quot;don&#39;t get it yet&quot;.
