Shocked me, when he started <br/>\npointing out to me when I was being inflexible and unreasonable, but it was <br/>\npretty cool.     (Would&#39;ve been good for him to be here earlier when I asked <br/>\nKirby to try to treat me more like a person and less like furniture.    I wish I <br/>\nhadn&#39;t said that.   Maybe it will help and maybe it will hurt, but it was me <br/>\nbeing whiney/pissy and not me being my best most mature self.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So pointing this cultural<br/>\n&gt; difference out has been fruitful, up until the other day when dh sort<br/>\n&gt; of half-heartedly tried to justify hisÂ  behavior by saying it was<br/>\n&gt; culturally relative.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unrelated to your husband or mine, I&#39;m jumping off from this to something <br/>\nelse.   Twice over the years this list has had someone com on (I think it was <br/>\nthis list) and then back out because of the anti-spanking tone of it.    In both <br/>\ncases the mom was Black.   In both cases spanking was held up as a cultural <br/>\ntradition, and not negotiable but necessary.   Culturally necessary.   One mom <br/>\nwas from the Caribbean and one staying with her dad in New Orleans for a while. <br/>\n The first time lots of moms argued and the mom (in Trinidad, I think) got <br/>\nangry.   The second time, nobody touched it and I felt bad for the mom, but it&#39;s <br/>\na cheap copout to say &quot;I can&#39;t be nice to my child, it&#39;s not native to my <br/>\nculture.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of things are native to a lot of people&#39;s cultures, including mine.   <br/>\nWhipping kids, turning them out entirely in a case of pregnancy, taking their <br/>\nmoney away from them if they work, throwing them out at 18 (or sooner).    <br/>\nPushing them into military service.   I saw that one lately, and heard of another <br/>\ncase (first family did school; second is homeschoolers).   In the first, the <br/>\nmom told her son (who was very attached, and hugged her evertime he woke up and <br/>\neverytime he left or returned) that when he turned 18 he could either go to <br/>\ncollege and pay for it all himself, or he could join the military.    I guess <br/>\nit didn&#39;t occur to him to say &quot;When I&#39;m 18 you don&#39;t get to limit my choices <br/>\nanymore&quot; so he joined the service.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn another family there are three, like mine but younger by a few years (15, <br/>\n13, 11 I think) and the dad who has a very good job has not saved nor is he <br/>\nplanning to pay for college at all.   He told them (just learned) that if they <br/>\nwant to go to college they need to join ROTC.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThe oldest is a girl, and an artist, and not a ROTC type of person.   She <br/>\nwants to go to an art college out of state.   She could go now.   Her dad makes <br/>\nher do online classes to get a high school diploma.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the best thing he could be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107737,"nextTopicId":107729}}
