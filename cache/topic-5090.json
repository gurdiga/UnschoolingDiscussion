I believe that Homeschooling is one of the<br/>\nbest ways to help kids with multiple allergies and/or sensitivities.  In a<br/>\nvery real and important sense we can control their environment much more<br/>\nthan if they were in IS.  This is not to say that I am &quot;sheltering&quot; my<br/>\nchild or giving him some unreal advantage that he will not be able to copy.<br/>\n On the contrary, adults have a lot of choices about what and where and<br/>\nwhen they eat, spend time, etc.  People can choose to leave a job if the<br/>\nsituation is not a healthy one, for whatever reasons.  Children in IS have<br/>\nno such luxury and must be where, when and what the schools tell them to<br/>\nbe.  We all know how inflexible and unhealthy IS can be for our children,<br/>\nand how many decisions are made in ignorance of, or contrary to, a child&#39;s<br/>\nwell being or a parent&#39;s wishes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso many allergies are cumulative in nature and by minimizing our<br/>\nchildren&#39;s exposures early in life we can give them the advantage of a<br/>\nstronger defense later.  I do not believe that exposure to allergens builds<br/>\na tolerance.  It has just not been my experience that allergies work this<br/>\nway.  Think about people who develop allergies from overexposure to things<br/>\nlike, say, shellfish.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, simple snack-time at a preschool could kill my child if they<br/>\nshould serve him cookies or peanut butter, or at the least send him into<br/>\nswelling, mucus from every oroface and prjectile vomitting if they serve<br/>\nhim milk, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe has severe hives and asthma reaction to most dogs, but seems to do well<br/>\nwith cats, conversely.  However, the cats are not allowed in his bedroom at<br/>\nall, least of all on his bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had undiagnosed (due to neglect) asthma and some food allergies as a<br/>\nchild, and I was constantly suffering.  Going hungry if the school lunch<br/>\nwas not something I could eat (which is BAD as I am hypoglycemic) having<br/>\nAstma attacks in PE, etc.  I got to the point where I would sit out of PE<br/>\nand take constant F&#39;s and 0&#39;s and the daily blows to self esteem, etc,<br/>\nrather than compromise myself in an Asthma attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving my children at home also helps me to be more in tune with their<br/>\nnatural ups and downs in energy, mood swings, and other bodily reactions<br/>\nthat might be signals of food or other problems.  I believe it lets me stay<br/>\non top of the issue much better than if I only spent a few hours a day with<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said before, I have not had much problem with sleeping for my son who<br/>\nhas Asthma and allergies.  I guess I have been lucky.  However, if you have<br/>\nforced air heat, try a filter in your child&#39;s room vent, and change the<br/>\nmain furnace filter (which should be a high efficiency one) every month.<br/>\nAlso you might try a humidifier, or mister to keep the air from being too<br/>\ndry.  Hard wood floors, or linoleum and lighter materials that are not as<br/>\nprone to holding dust on draperies and upholstered furniture are also<br/>\nhelpful.  If you have indoor pets I would try to keep them out of the<br/>\nchild&#39;s room, and or keep them in another area of the home, if possible.<br/>\nUse an ostrich feather duster or the new magnetic dust cloths for dusting,<br/>\nto avoid stirring up dust.  Put anti-allergy coverings on matresses and<br/>\npillows and buy bedding with anti-allergy fillings.  Remove extra stuffed<br/>\nanimals from your child&#39;s room, or other items that can catch and hold<br/>\nallergens.  Vacume often, floors, draperies and furnishings.<br/>\nHmmmm....that&#39;s about all I can think of off the top of my head.  Of course<br/>\nyou may have already evaluated all of these areas, but I hope you can find<br/>\nsomething useful here.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bishop Family","from":"&quot;Bishop Family&quot; &lt;bishop6@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"XQ9rcPy01i3Fyl8aKLliOcT1wned6DSSr2-ejoG4z_nCQfzcSAO4n6LbVJLLE7AKTWnji7G0EUT2SWmr80GLgWWLkcL3RzrYqm7GIQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Late Nights and Allergic Children","postDate":"944172405","msgId":5091,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zMjYuNTA5MS45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5090,"nextInTopic":5092,"prevInTime":5090,"nextInTime":5092,"topicId":5090,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"WOW...I just join this list and walked in on a topic I have been trying to find help/info/support on for months!!!
