If the writer of that would be willing to share it here, I think it would be very helpful!********<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the unschoolingpartnerships list we were talking about avoidable regrets.  Mine relates to my husband&#39;s passion for football (soccer).<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce upon a time I greeted the Football World Cup with dread, scorn, and deep, dark wells of resentment.  I hated the way Craig had to watch every single game.  Every game! I hated that he lost sleep, that he had to take naps during the afternoon, that our lounge turned into his fanboy-den week after week.  I even hated the sound of the cheering coming from the TV.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHis attention was elsewhere, and I didn&#39;t like it one little bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been together for 23 years.  With a World Cup every four years, and each competition lasting just over a month, that&#39;s at least 6 months of my life spent stomping around full of bile and self-pity and jealousy.  Half a year of my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here is one unforeseen, and really, REALLY wonderful benefit of our past year and a half of unschooling  the World Cup came along again, and I realized that I wanted to share in this passion.  Not bustle my way in, not to take over and direct, but to support and enjoy Craig&#39;s love of the game.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCraig went to bed early each night so that he could get up to watch games in the middle of the night.  I made sure the sofa bed in the lounge was all made up for him each evening, and that the TV remote controls were right there, ready to go.  I cheerfully tidied up the lounge in the morning. I made sure that he had time in the weekends to catch up on sleep.  I bought him magazines about the Cup, and brought home library books about football.  We thoroughly enjoyed watching two documentaries about football (and look at those connections  from football to politics to music to 1970s sexism to  golly  everything!) <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of seeing the World Cup as something that would take Craig away from me, I saw it for what it was  a fabulous opportunity to get closer to my man.  I&#39;m still not one to sit down and watch a whole game of football, but I am a real fan of seeing Craig joyful and passionate and having fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually felt sad when the World Cup wall chart in our kitchen came down at the end of the tournament.  It&#39;s four loooong years to wait until the next one! (and that is absolutely at the top of my list of Things I Never Thought I&#39;d Say).<br/>\n <br/>\nThinking about it some more, being controlling is such a closed-off, rigid and often colourless place to be.  My original World Cup-free zone had placed me on a dreary little island, all by myself, righteous to the hilt.<br/>\n<br/>\nOpening myself up to something new and different ended up being not just good for Craig and I as a couple, but rewarding for me, too.  The world is bigger now, more zingy, with more connections, as well as noisier with those vuvuzelas ringing in my ears ; )  The kids got into it too, from following our New Zealand All Whites team (the only unbeaten team in the tournament!), to enjoying having snuggles on the sofabed.  Many times Harry and Charlotte said how happy they were to see their Dad excited about the World Cup.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo use Sandra&#39;s cocktail party idea, I&#39;d rather be on the side of the room talking football and all the drama, stories and colour that goes with it.  The other side of the room is where the wives are talking about how they can&#39;t wait for it to end and how stupid it all is.  And by definition, how stupid their husbands are for being interested in it.

Is TV family time only when it leads to thinking <br/>\nand sharing?  It would be hard for it not to lead to those things, but can TV <br/>\nwatching, and movie watching, be just that?  Can you watch TV or movies and sit <br/>\nback and just watch and then move onto something else when done, or does it need <br/>\nto be leading to something?  It&#39;s a trick question in a way because I&#39;m not sure <br/>\na person could do anything without thinking and sharing, but if the goal is <br/>\nthinking and sharing, that&#39;s different than if the goal is to do something <br/>\nenjoyable together in which thinking and sharing will likely happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat DOES family time look like in your family?  You&#39;ve mention 2 different <br/>\nthings about family time, one is that weekends are family time and that family <br/>\ntime isn&#39;t generally watching TV.  So, what DO you do?  I completely understand <br/>\nthe desire to spend time together as a family.  Some families do that in really <br/>\nsimple ways and some families insist on formal time spent together.  If it&#39;s the <br/>\nlatter, how do the kids feel about it and how would they do it different if they <br/>\ncould?<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":405463163,"authorName":"Susan Steynberg","from":"Susan Steynberg &lt;suzisword@...&gt;","profile":"suzisword","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] TV more powerful than the mom?","postDate":"1279890448","msgId":56344,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrQld2ZnU5cVVMVTVGcnl6NlNBbVZFa3dGdFlTZjRfUXhiVHRiaUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEU1QjFFNDE5LTk1NDUtNDdDMy1BOEE4LUU0MjMxNDYzQ0JENkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEU1QjFFNDE5LTk1NDUtNDdDMy1BOEE4LUU0MjMxNDYzQ0JENkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":56343,"nextInTopic":56348,"prevInTime":56343,"nextInTime":56345,"topicId":56343,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all -=-we are doing alot of movie watch to connect, but the guilt of TV during the day is something fierce..not to mention the schoolwork -=- What","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1358786967\">Hi all<br/>\n-=-we are doing alot of movie watch to connect, but the guilt of TV<br/>\nduring the day is something fierce..not to mention the &quot;schoolwork&#39; -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat schoolwork?<br/>\nI wanted to say and &quot;NO schoolwork&quot; during the day because we r making the<br/>\nshift to unschooling, so it came out wrong, (it&#39;s difficult to communicate<br/>\nthrough writing) And we are watching movies to laugh and cry and discuss and<br/>\nhave something in common.
