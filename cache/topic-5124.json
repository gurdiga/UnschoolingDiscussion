","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1097720590\">From: Susan Robinson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:garden-inside@...\">garden-inside@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Friend problems<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;SNIP&gt; My daughter does not want to give up on this girl but she is truly<br/>\nhurt.<br/>\nAny suggestions?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Susan,<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat is a tough situation for Naomi! It is always hard when a close<br/>\nfriend seems to so easily write you off completely just because you do<br/>\nsomething that is different than what they expect from you. Being<br/>\ninclined to do things my own way, this has happened to me a few times. It<br/>\nis always painful, but easier to handle each time.<br/>\n\tI would tell my dd that sometimes, people can&#39;t handle it when we do<br/>\nsomething that serves our true selves, rather than going along with the<br/>\ncrowd. They probably feel it is some kind of threat, and it is really<br/>\nabout *them* and their inability to be open to individual<br/>\nexpressions--not about us. <br/>\n\tNaomi is obviously not going to &quot;win&quot; back this girl&#39;s friendship. The<br/>\ngirl&#39;s poem makes that pretty clear, as do her nasty comments. So, IMHO,<br/>\nthe best thing you can do for your dd is help her express her hurt and<br/>\nloss in an appropriate manner. Perhaps she needs to punch pillows,<br/>\nscream, write a poem in response (and not send it), do an angry dance, or<br/>\nmake a memorial to the good things about the now-dead friendship. When I<br/>\nsuffer a loss, it really helps me to write about it, just to myself, and<br/>\nthen to create something--usually artwork. Often, I am amazed at what<br/>\ncomes out.<br/>\n\tIt is also very important that Naomi know that all of her feelings about<br/>\nthis, and toward the girl, are completely normal. She could be angry one<br/>\nmoment, and fearful the next. There might be grief, guilt or regret,<br/>\nquestioning herself and her worth, and many other emotions.<br/>\n\tI think it&#39;s instinctual for us to want to protect our children from<br/>\nsuch hurtful events, but we can&#39;t possibly do that--especially throughout<br/>\ntheir lives. The best we can do is help them understand human nature, and<br/>\nhelp them learn what they need to do when faced with these situations.<br/>\nThat will help them safely negotiate  a lifetime of ups and downs. <br/>\n\tBest of luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Shay<br/>\n<br/>\nFOLC eclectic homeschool support group <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/page/folcfolks\">http://expage.com/page/folcfolks</a><br/>\nVaEclecticHomeschool discussion list<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/VaEclecticHomeschool\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/VaEclecticHomeschool</a><br/>\nVirginia Home Education Association<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.people.virginia.edu/~pm6f/vhea.html\">http://www.people.virginia.edu/~pm6f/vhea.html</a><br/>\nNational Home Education Network <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhen.org\">http://www.nhen.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5093,"nextTopicId":5102}}
