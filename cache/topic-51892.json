My dd woke up with her period this <br/>\nmorning so she had a quiet morning curled up in bed after taking some <br/>\nMidol.  My 11 yo ds, after getting up bright and perky at 7:30 am!, <br/>\nspent all morning playing on the computer to his hearts content. <br/>\nUsusally, I have had to beg plead and bargain with him to get up and <br/>\nget ready for school. It was wonderful to see him get up happy this <br/>\nmorning.  My 7 yo, otoh, slept til almost 10. After he had a bowl of <br/>\noatmeal for breakfast, he said he was ready for school.. LOL  He was <br/>\ngrinning so  big and he brought me a  book called &quot;What your second <br/>\ngrader needs to know&quot;  He actually loves that book and he and I took <br/>\nturns reading whatever struck his fancy.  This morning he wanted to <br/>\nlook at maps and try to figure out which state is bigger and <br/>\nfartherest away from us. He loves maps and geography.  OH.. <br/>\n&lt;interjection&gt;  I saw this interactive globe from Leap Frog while I <br/>\nwas shopping this weekend.. I know he would love that thing.. Maybe <br/>\nSanta can come up with some inventive budgeting to cover it for a <br/>\nsurprise gift ( since ds doesnt even know the thing exists) OK back <br/>\nto our day...I gave the kids an early christmas present of some of <br/>\nthose velvet posters.  They spent a while coloring those in and <br/>\nproudly displaying thier talents.  We had bologna sandwiches for <br/>\nlunch and some chex mix and Sundrop.  The boys spent a lot of time <br/>\noutside as it was in the upper 60s here today.  We wrapped more <br/>\nChristmas presents, each child taking a turn to help wrap the others <br/>\ngifts.   Dd had an orthodontist appt at 3, she got green and red <br/>\nbands.  Dd asked for cinnamon toast when we got home, and everyone <br/>\ndecided they wanted some, so I made a pan of cinnamon toast.   Dd <br/>\nchecked her email and surfed around the net some while the boys spent <br/>\nsome more time outside jumping on the trampoline.  I had plenty of <br/>\ntime to sweep the floor, pick up clothes and toys, wash dishes and <br/>\nthrow in a load of laundry.  All in all, a very good first day of the <br/>\nrest of our unschooling lives.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDiane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

Completely jibed with <br/>\nunschooling as soon as I found it, and he taught me a lot.  He went back in <br/>\nthe second half of 10th and stayed through the first half of 11th.  (But <br/>\nbefore that he went to college.  &lt;g&gt;)  He went to school for the girls, he <br/>\nsays.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe spent a day like that yesterday, kinda.  I was actually spending it with <br/>\nthe 9 yo (don&#39;t take sensitive 9yo&#39;s to see 8 Crazy Nights, BTW), and we were <br/>\nat the mall where my son works.  So we spent time with him in his store, and <br/>\non his break and had fun.  He&#39;s not pierced or tattooed, but works in a place <br/>\nwith lots of people who are, and sells body jewelry at the store.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLong ago I told him he couldn&#39;t get pierced or tattooed until he was 18, <br/>\nbecause I didn&#39;t want to be the one he blamed if he didn&#39;t like it or <br/>\nregretted it someday.  He did get an earlobe pierced this summer, but let it <br/>\ngrow back because it hurt too much!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll this time since he left school (the first time), it seems to me that he <br/>\nhas been just marking time until he can be and do stuff on his own.  That&#39;s <br/>\nnot to say that he didn&#39;t learn and do things in these intervening years!  <br/>\nIt&#39;s just not all what he *wanted* to do.  Everything he&#39;s really *wanted* to <br/>\ndo has been blocked by driving laws, day time curfews and compulsory <br/>\nattendance, and at times he had to live furtively, watching his back.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow he&#39;s really doing it, though.  His goal is to be a &quot;rock star&quot; and we can <br/>\nlaugh at the cliche, but now he&#39;s in a band and doing auditions with record <br/>\ncompanies and benefit concerts and everything.   Doing what he wants to do, <br/>\nwith complete freedom (fettered by money, sometimes!)...and we get to claim <br/>\nhe&#39;s still in high school if it&#39;s convenient!  <br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132894636,"authorName":"crazymoma67 &lt;crazymoma67@yahoo.com&gt;","from":"&quot;crazymoma67 &lt;crazymoma67@...&gt;&quot; &lt;crazymoma67@...&gt;","profile":"crazymoma67","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: UNSCHOOLING!

He&#39;s a full-convert <br/>\nnow (he&#39;ll be 15 next month), and sees all his friends in high school SO <br/>\nmiserable. He talks with them about it all the time: they think he&#39;ll get no <br/>\neducation and won&#39;t be successful---they&#39;re brainwashed already!

I need advice!!  I got through the <br/>\nsituation, but I would still like to know how others would have <br/>\nhandled this.  I am sure that things like this will come up a lot as <br/>\nme and my family are all learning how to get along with this new <br/>\nconcept.  OK, here&#39;s the deal.  The kids wanted me to wrap some <br/>\nChristmas gifts last night.. I wrapped a few for each of them.  Well, <br/>\n7 yo ds wanted to open one this morning.  This Christmas is going to <br/>\nbe slim and they dont have many to open.  I struggled with what to <br/>\ndo.  I have let them open presents before Christmas before.. Then, on <br/>\nChristmas Eve, when we open packages, they are disappointed because <br/>\nthey have fewer to open than the other children.  Because of this,I <br/>\nhad vowed to not let them open any presents early.  Well, now that I <br/>\nam trying to T(My)CS, I didnt know what to do.   He got more and more <br/>\nupset wanting to open his presents.  Thats when I decided to wrap up <br/>\nthe velvet poster I had bought and let him open it.  My rationale was <br/>\nthat that particular gift was inexpensive and more disposable as a <br/>\nChristmas gift.  The other kids wanted to color thiers too, so I let <br/>\nthem all have thier posters.   They really enjoyed the posters today, <br/>\nand ds was satisfied at opening that one gift. But, now what?? What <br/>\nabout tomorrow ? What if he wants to open all of his gifts and then <br/>\nhe has none to open on Christmas Eve when the other children open <br/>\nthiers?

Here&#39;s how our first day went.  You think we <br/>\nare on the right track? <br/>\n<br/>\nI had to get up and take my oldest son to school. He loves school and <br/>\nhas no desire to stay home.  My dd woke up with her period this <br/>\nmorning so she had a quiet morning curled up in bed after taking some <br/>\nMidol.  My 11 yo ds, after getting up bright and perky at 7:30 am!, <br/>\nspent all morning playing on the computer to his hearts content. <br/>\nUsusally, I have had to beg plead and bargain with him to get up and <br/>\nget ready for school. It was wonderful to see him get up happy this <br/>\nmorning.  My 7 yo, otoh, slept til almost 10. After he had a bowl of <br/>\noatmeal for breakfast, he said he was ready for school.. LOL  He was <br/>\ngrinning so  big and he brought me a  book called &quot;What your second <br/>\ngrader needs to know&quot;  He actually loves that book and he and I took <br/>\nturns reading whatever struck his fancy.  This morning he wanted to <br/>\nlook at maps and try to figure out which state is bigger and <br/>\nfartherest away from us. He loves maps and geography.  OH.. <br/>\n&lt;interjection&gt;  I saw this interactive globe from Leap Frog while I <br/>\nwas shopping this weekend.. I know he would love that thing.. Maybe <br/>\nSanta can come up with some inventive budgeting to cover it for a <br/>\nsurprise gift ( since ds doesnt even know the thing exists) OK back <br/>\nto our day...I gave the kids an early christmas present of some of <br/>\nthose velvet posters.  They spent a while coloring those in and <br/>\nproudly displaying thier talents.  We had bologna sandwiches for <br/>\nlunch and some chex mix and Sundrop.  The boys spent a lot of time <br/>\noutside as it was in the upper 60s here today.  We wrapped more <br/>\nChristmas presents, each child taking a turn to help wrap the others <br/>\ngifts.   Dd had an orthodontist appt at 3, she got green and red <br/>\nbands.  Dd asked for cinnamon toast when we got home, and everyone <br/>\ndecided they wanted some, so I made a pan of cinnamon toast.   Dd <br/>\nchecked her email and surfed around the net some while the boys spent <br/>\nsome more time outside jumping on the trampoline.  I had plenty of <br/>\ntime to sweep the floor, pick up clothes and toys, wash dishes and <br/>\nthrow in a load of laundry.  All in all, a very good first day of the <br/>\nrest of our unschooling lives.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDiane</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59469462,"authorName":"Gerard Westenberg","from":"&quot;Gerard Westenberg&quot; &lt;westen@...&gt;","profile":"leonieann2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] UNSCHOOLING!

She&#39;s eleven, and will at some point have <br/>\ncramps regularly for a while, I suppose.  Hasn&#39;t started her period, but <br/>\nshowed me where it hurt, said it it didn&#39;t feel like any sore muscles from <br/>\nskating, nor any stomach or intestinal thing.  She took an Aleve, sat with <br/>\nhot corn bag on it for a while, felt better, and went bicycling with a <br/>\nneighbor who just got a new bike.  Before that she was listening to the Raffi <br/>\nChistmas stuff (which has been lost in a box in the garage for two years), <br/>\nand helping me make pancakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther kids her age are in school, pretty much marking time because it&#39;s the <br/>\nweek before a vacation and schools get airy and ghostly in those times, from <br/>\nsome people being gone and the rest being distracted.  Anyone trying to &quot;keep <br/>\nup with school&quot; in such seasons can totally relax.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby ate pancakes, was sweet to everyone (his vacation did him good), talked <br/>\nto his dad about various things, culminating in his coming and asking if we <br/>\nhad a copy of Disney&#39;s Jungle Book.  I didn&#39;t ask why.  Maybe because he saw <br/>\nTreasure Planet this weekend, and I know Keith likes The Jungle Book.  I had <br/>\none home-copy I bought at a fleamarket or somewhere.  He took it happily.  <br/>\nThen Keith took him to work, where he&#39;ll be from the 2:30 he got there to <br/>\n7:30 tonight, first doing general floor stuff, and later running anime gaming <br/>\nnight.  Lots of kids consider him a famous gaming celebrity in town.  He gets <br/>\nawestruck looks at the mall.   And he has over two years now of real work in <br/>\na retail business.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMarty is helping his dad cut wood to make a medieval rope bed, for camping. <br/>\nBefore that he was playing an online game a friend of his just finished after <br/>\ntwo years of planning, brainstorming and home experimentation.  It&#39;s <br/>\nfinished.  Oh... and he skated to the credit union to get me cash, and then <br/>\ntried to rent a DVD or video, but Hollywood Video was out of both (of the <br/>\nmovies he wanted). After the wood is cut, Marty and I are going to watch Good <br/>\nWill Hunting.  He doesn&#39;t believe it has &quot;the f word&quot; more than Jay and <br/>\nSilent Bob.  I said I was sure it did.  That made me remember that Holly has <br/>\nrequested a click counter (like people use for gate counts) as a gift and I <br/>\nhad forgotten.  I wish we had it today.   I&#39;ll use tic-marks on a notebook <br/>\nand later we&#39;ll have to count the other.  I told Marty I thought there were <br/>\nonline sites with counts already, but he wants us to count them ourselves.   <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen Good Will Hunting twice; he&#39;s never seen it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, although it&#39;s a light day (so far, at 2:53), I&#39;m fully confident <br/>\nthat my kids are having more experiences today which will spark their thought <br/>\nand imagination than kids in school, AND they&#39;re getting some exercise.  <br/>\nHolly&#39;s biking, Marty skated on errands, and Kirby will get that sort of <br/>\nexercise people get working with ten or twenty kids, moving between and <br/>\naround tables, then taking all that stuff up and vacuuming.    PE.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith just said &quot;Well thank you, Martin&quot; outside the window, and Marty said <br/>\n&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTime to watch a movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52047,"nextTopicId":52070}}
