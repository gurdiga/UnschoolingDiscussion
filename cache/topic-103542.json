One amusing example from a while ago, was when she came<br/>\nrunning in to tell us about a problem with her &quot;asshole&quot;, there turned out<br/>\nto be paint all over her &quot;asshole&quot; - aha! Her easel. We refrained from<br/>\ncorrecting her specifically, but used the word &quot;easel&quot; in *real*<br/>\nconversations and she started using the right word after while. (Sigh)<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt tells a story about the rise of &quot;the devil-teacher in him&quot; where<br/>\nhe was being very self-congratulatory about how he cleverly inserted a<br/>\ncorrect pronunciation of a mispronounced word into a conversation with a<br/>\nchild, with the motivation of subtly instructing her. He later came to<br/>\nbelieve that he was utterly in the wrong to do so, because his whole focus<br/>\nin the dialogue had been where and how he could do so, instead of listening<br/>\nto the subsequent speech properly and enjoying the moment with his young<br/>\nfriend. It&#39;s in either &quot;How Children Learn&quot; or &quot;How Children Fail&quot; - both of<br/>\nwhich I have in storage so I can&#39;t check. <br/>\n<br/>\nChoosing not to correct is sometimes tough to do. I have to do it actively -<br/>\nactively hold back the words - and remind myself to stay in the moment,<br/>\nespecially when Jayn&#39;s meaning is clear and the mistake is essentially<br/>\ncosmetic. When Jayn is in the mode of making a correction for herself, she<br/>\nwill sometimes struggle through several different repetitions of the problem<br/>\nword, each on closer to the correct one. The only time I give her the<br/>\ninformation is when she actually asks &quot;Is that right?&quot; Her father and I have<br/>\nthe same spirit in terms of her writing letters or numbers backwards,<br/>\nespecially since it is clear that she recognizes letters written the right<br/>\nway around. The most important priority is avoiding making her feel<br/>\n&quot;in-the-wrong&quot; or self-conscious.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
