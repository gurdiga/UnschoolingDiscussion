I was surfing the web looking for Homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; Publication and groups, and I came across your useful website! I would<br/>\n&gt; like to speak to someone about how to make  our resources more<br/>\n&gt; convenient for your Florida Homeschoolers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Under your regional field trip section, Kennedy Space Center is listed<br/>\n&gt; as expensive and crowded. Is there any way to change that description? I<br/>\n&gt; would like to highlight our educational value to both students and<br/>\n&gt; educators.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We do have a Salute to Homeschoolers Day in March. Please see below for<br/>\n&gt; details<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would appreciate some suggestions or advice on how to better reach<br/>\n&gt; your members.  We have wonderful programs for performance groups, Scout<br/>\n&gt; troops and student groups. Please check out our range of educational<br/>\n&gt; programs at:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/html/educators_zone.html\">http://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/html/educators_zone.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you for your time and council.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Most sincerely,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Susan Hubscher<br/>\n&gt; Delaware North Parks Services<br/>\n&gt; Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex<br/>\n&gt; Mail Code: DNPS<br/>\n&gt; Kennedy Space Center<br/>\n&gt; Florida, 32899<br/>\n&gt; 321-449-4348<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shubsche@...\">shubsche@...</a><br/>\n&gt;  **********************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In replying to her note to ask if she&#39;d like me to forward her inquiry<br/>\n&gt; to the list, I also asked her if KSC could spare a representative for<br/>\n&gt; LIFE Fest 2003. She replied that she would love to attend, so now we<br/>\n&gt; will have KSC representation at LIFE Fest. (I&#39;ve also asked if they<br/>\n&gt; would like to present a children&#39;s program.  I&#39;ll let you know what I<br/>\n&gt; hear back.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In my brief chat with Ms. Hubscher, I said that, as far as I was<br/>\n&gt; concerned, I enjoyed KSC, but was disappointed when they started<br/>\n&gt; charging admission fees just to enter the grounds (they used to only<br/>\n&gt; charge for the bus tours and films)and was unable to attend with the<br/>\n&gt; frequency I had before the fees were instituted (when I lived in<br/>\n&gt; Brevard).  I wondered if they would consider a periodic free or reduced<br/>\n&gt; admission day for educators and this is what she wrote back:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ***********************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What a helpful response! I would certainly like to volunteer to attend<br/>\n&gt; the LIFE fest. I will bring over our Education Information and answer<br/>\n&gt; any questions from the participants. This would be a great chance to<br/>\n&gt; listen to comments and receive a different perspective directly from the<br/>\n&gt; market. Thank you for the invitation!  What a coincidence in dates!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The charge for attendance is certainly a change from the open policy<br/>\n&gt; from prior years, and local teachers have had a bit of a harder time<br/>\n&gt; organizing and executing field trips. However, the increase in price was<br/>\n&gt; necessary to bring in the new amazing exhibits, activities and<br/>\n&gt; resources. See, KSCVC is not funded at all by  government money, and the<br/>\n&gt; admission prices have allowed incredible improvements to the educators<br/>\n&gt; experience! We are now, after these improvements, one of the top 5<br/>\n&gt; attractions in Central Florida, and less expensive than our competition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will definitely keep the discounted admission day in mind. The Salute<br/>\n&gt; to Homeschoolers Day does have a cost, but  lunch and specialized<br/>\n&gt; activities are included to the participants.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please do post the question on the web-site. We are very interested in<br/>\n&gt; becoming more involved with this dedicated group of educators, and any<br/>\n&gt; feedback would certainly be  helpful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I look forward to accepting comments and suggestions, and I am happy to<br/>\n&gt; be attending the LIFE Fest!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Talk to you soon,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Susan Hubscher<br/>\n&gt; 321-449-4349<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shubsche@...\">shubsche@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **********************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, if you have suggestions or comments for the Kennedy Space Center,<br/>\n&gt; send them along.  You can send them right to Ms. Hubscher, but send them<br/>\n&gt; to the list, too. Maybe we can compile them into a nice list of<br/>\n&gt; suggestions complements of LIFE of Florida.
