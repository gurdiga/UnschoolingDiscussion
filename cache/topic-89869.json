She still gets clothes from our room but doesn&#39;t create the same mess.

My daughter&#39;s (now my son&#39;s as well) is really too small for too much so that was creating horrible messes. I moved out most of the toys to a part of the living room, made sure they were well organized with their own containers (the key to messes for me is always make sure there&#39;s a spot for everything, a basic organization beneath the mess so even if the house is a disaster I&#39;ve got a starting point and it doesn&#39;t take that long to clean). Now my daughter has books, a spring horse, CD player and a change table with CD&#39;s and cassettes in the drawer and stuffed animals filling it up. And that&#39;s it besides the bunk beds (wonderful purchase, for $150C online at Ikea my daughter has a private play area that her brother can&#39;t get to...and I never have to notice the never made bed). They play in the living room. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Ok, I think I&#39;ll share my newly thought of philosophy of housework here. It started when my sister was over and chasing the kids around. I was straightening up the livingroom and had just finished piling up blocks (Big cardboard ones. We have, in all, 10 or eleven different kinds of wood, plastic and cardboard blocks. I feel so wealthy. :) ) when my son (2) ran into the room, saw the blocks and immediatly tore down the pile. I smiled and shook my head. My sister, who&#39;d arrived in time to see this, sternly said, &quot;Harry! Your mother just finished putting those away!&quot; When she said that I felt offended. Didn&#39;t she know I only pile those blocks so that Harry can knock them down? And there was the Aha! I looked around the room at the clean living room and realized that was why I did any cleaning. <br/>\n      We don&#39;t clean up messes to have a clean house. We clean up messes so there is room for more mess!<br/>\n      Now I think of cleaning up after my kids as replacing a canvas. I do it with the thought that by giving them room again and a bare floor and organized toys to pick from I&#39;m handing them the tools to write another mess onto our house. It&#39;s meant that at the end of a day, or sometimes a few days in a row, I just let the mess stay, because really, it&#39;s a work of art or a story. Maybe it isn&#39;t finished. Maybe it&#39;s too interesting to be gotten rid of so soon. It also clears up my feelings of resentment about doing the bulk of it. I like being the one to reset the house so that we all can live another, different mess the next day.<br/>\n      Anyway, thought I&#39;d share since it&#39;s really helped me bring more joy into the housework!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140408439,"authorName":"Erika Nunn","from":"&quot;Erika Nunn&quot; &lt;erikanunn@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Cleaning room question..","postDate":"1075091420","msgId":89869,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTctRjVta3FHQ3VZYUIwZEYwMDAxNDQ3NEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":89872,"prevInTime":89868,"nextInTime":89870,"topicId":89869,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"But before that question, I just wanted to add (regarding the praise question) that sometimes I only say, Those lines are interesting, because all that is on","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-516496153\">But before that question, I just wanted to add (regarding the praise <br/>\nquestion) that sometimes I only say, &quot;Those lines are interesting,&quot; because <br/>\nall that is on the paper IS lines.  And lots of them.  lol<br/>\n<br/>\nBut on to my cleaning room question.  Again, my children are ages 3 and 4.  <br/>\nI want to know what you guys do when it comes to keeping your children&#39;s <br/>\nroom clean (and the rest of the house of their toys).  It seems that my <br/>\nchildren can produce a mess (to them it is all exploration and play, of <br/>\ncourse) within about 10 minutes time.  For example, they love their closet.  <br/>\nSometimes if left alone in their room, they will completely dismantle the <br/>\nentire thing, taking all their clothes off the hangers so they have a monkey <br/>\nbar, taking apart boxes to make ladders, etc.  Honestly, I am (almost - ha) <br/>\nalways really happy to see them happy and having fun making their closet <br/>\ninto some great land of monkeys.  However, when the game is over, what is <br/>\nleft is this disastorous closet.  (I have explained that they can move their <br/>\nclothes over to make room for the monkey bar, and that they can ask me to <br/>\nhelp them make a ladder, etc).  What my question is, is that when kids DO <br/>\nmake a mess, do you guys feel it is important to &quot;make&quot; them help you clean <br/>\nit up with you?  Or do you just clean it up yourself in good nature?  I know <br/>\nall about making cleaning fun, etc., but what if they both say, &quot;no, we are <br/>\ngoing to go play,&quot; and the job is left to you?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, what about the overall standards of their bedrooms?  I know rotten <br/>\nfood is one thing that HAS to be dealt with, but other than that do you just <br/>\nlet them keep their rooms in the state they want to keep them in?  I would <br/>\nnot think about it if my children were older, because I would know they had <br/>\nthe ability to clean their room if they wanted to.  But I am not really sure <br/>\nat what point I should just stop cleaning their room and let them handle it? <br/>\n  Right now I usually clean their room everyday and don&#39;t expect them to <br/>\nhelp me.  Or should I?<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I am rambling here, but I am sure you get my point.  From reading the <br/>\npast threads, I have gotten the sense that most of you tend to just let your <br/>\nkids pitch in when they want to, and that tends to happen when they reach an <br/>\nolder age...?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll advice is greatly appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\nErika  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the coupons and bargains on MSN Offers! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://shopping.msn.com/softcontent/softcontent.aspx?scmId=1418\">http://shopping.msn.com/softcontent/softcontent.aspx?scmId=1418</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89960,"nextTopicId":89991}}
