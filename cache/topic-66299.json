I love to hear moms talk<br/>\nlike that. I remember an old friend who had children way before I did<br/>\ntalking about how much she enjoyed bf and I just couldn&#39;t understand what<br/>\nwould be so enjoyable for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first 3 children were only nursed for a few months each. They each went<br/>\nthrough a very cranky period and all I kept hearing was that it was my<br/>\nbreast milk. Even the pediatrician suggested I switch to formula. I really<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know anything else. No one in my family ever breastfed and no friends<br/>\ndid for more than a month and I had no support whatsoever telling me<br/>\notherwise. I stopped nursing as I didn&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my last, I was determined to bf the way I always had wanted to. My life<br/>\nwas in a whole different direction and I had major support. Of course the<br/>\nfamily was the first to say whenever the baby would cry the least little bit<br/>\nthat it was probably my breast milk. How nice huh??? I had developed a major<br/>\nnasty case of ezcema all around and on my nipples. They bled and I would<br/>\nalso get a breast infection every few months but I refused to stop. When my<br/>\nhusband saw what my breasts looked like, he even suggested I switch to a<br/>\nbottle, not formula, just a bottle. Well after our little chat &lt;bg&gt; he never<br/>\nmentioned that again!! I was all set to go at least 2 years nursing but<br/>\nAlyssa had other plans for me. She weaned herself down to 3-4 times a day at<br/>\nage one and when she was almost a year and a half, she stopped completely<br/>\nwithin 2 days time. I kept asking if she wanted to nurse and was heartbroken<br/>\nwhen the answer kept being no. I still long for those days. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll<br/>\nget another nursing chance again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"jmcseals SEALS","from":"&quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: : Breastfeeding WAS: Barbie","postDate":"1051554494","msgId":66340,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjQwckl6OFV0NjVCVkUwMDAwMjA1MkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":66338,"nextInTopic":66362,"prevInTime":66339,"nextInTime":66341,"topicId":66299,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Enjoy the days you have.
