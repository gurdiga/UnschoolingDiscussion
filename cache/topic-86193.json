Some of that had to do <br/>\nwith not yet being 18, and the local school district getting to put their <br/>\nfinger in the pie.  I remember thinking that I would find someone in Missouri (I <br/>\nknow people) who would let us use their address so my son could just walk in and <br/>\ntake the test.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t looked since then, but I wonder if it&#39;s harder or easier to just go <br/>\nin and take it.  I thought maybe I would try to take it just for the fun of <br/>\nit, so I could see what it was all about, but I remember there being some <br/>\nprohibition against high school graduates taking it.  I always wondered how they <br/>\nwould know about if a 40-something graduated from high school?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the years to come, I&#39;ll bet they&#39;ll know about EVERYONE&#39;s status, and that <br/>\nscares the bejeepers out of me.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":86214,"nextTopicId":85848}}
