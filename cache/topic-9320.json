Lots of history there.  A beautiful state house, a museum and<br/>\n&gt; old revolutionary war barracks all within one block.  We are close to<br/>\n&gt; Trenton where we live now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Griffith Morgan house in Pennsauken, NJ is one of the oldest houses in NJ.<br/>\n&gt; (may be the oldest house in NJ, kind of hard to find, unless you know where<br/>\n&gt; it is.  Of course, my husband does know where it is, so he could give you<br/>\n&gt; directions if you are interested)  Also, close to the aquarium and the<br/>\n&gt; aquarium in across the river from the Philadelphia Zoo.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Princeton, NJ is a really cool town.  (About 20 minutes from Trenton)Albert<br/>\n&gt; Einstein lived there.  They shot the film I.Q. there.  You can tour<br/>\n&gt; Princeton University campus.  Their library is famous and they have a great<br/>\n&gt; art museum which is open to the public.  It is also home to black squirrels<br/>\n&gt; which aren&#39;t found anywhere else in the U.S.  They were imported from<br/>\n&gt; England because the University was based on Cambridge U and they had black<br/>\n&gt; squirrels on campus (they are also very friendly as they are used to being<br/>\n&gt; around people).  Also, a lot of history in Princeton (an old grave yard,<br/>\n&gt; homes, etc.)  Also home to Princeton Theological Seminary school (right next<br/>\n&gt; to the University) The Annex is a must eat at place, it is in a basement,<br/>\n&gt; but has been around a very long time and they have pictures on the walls of<br/>\n&gt; all of the famous and historical people who have dined there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, I know that is a novel and we are still trying to think if there is<br/>\n&gt; anything else.  Of course, Philadelphia is filled with historical stops<br/>\n&gt; ((Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, Elfreth&#39;s Alley (old cobblestone street<br/>\n&gt; with original houses, can tour them))  I could probably go on forever, so I<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good luck and I wish we were going with you.  It sounds like great fun.  If<br/>\n&gt; you want to say &quot;Hi&quot; when you get to NJ, just let us know...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bonnie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aimeesouth@...\">aimeesouth@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Homeschooling across the United States!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 15 Jun 2000 01:34:52 -0000<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hello all! We&#39;re going to embark on a new stage of our homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; &gt;journey! On Feb 1, 2001 our family is going to travel the 48 states<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in a motor home! Our family includes myself, Aimee 28 yrs. old, my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;husband Mark, 33 and our 2 daughters, Alexandria (age 7) and Tabitha<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(1 1/2).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Our plan is to spend about a week in each state. The reason I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt;writing is we&#39;d love to hear from homeschoolers in other states about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what are some &quot;don&#39;t miss&quot; activities in your area/state, also we&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; &gt;love to hear about what&#39;s unique to your area.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Homeschoolers seem to often have great ideas that aren&#39;t listed in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;guide books&quot;!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;We&#39;re not looking for amusement parks, one thing we&#39;re doing for sure<br/>\n&gt; &gt;are staying with Omish friends in Indiana so that we can really<br/>\n&gt; &gt;experience their life.

If you should decided to head down through CA from the Oregon end,<br/>\n&gt; take 101.  A must stop is a wide spot in the road called Orick.  Roosevelt<br/>\n&gt; Elk have the right of way on the freeway (well, so it is a nice two lane<br/>\n&gt; highway, it is still called a freeway &lt;g&gt;) and they are always grazing by<br/>\n&gt; the side of the road.  A right towards the ocean brings you out at Fern<br/>\n&gt; Canyon where Lost World was filmed.  About 45 miles south you will come to<br/>\n&gt; Trinidad and Patrick&#39;s Point State Park (btw, you can buy a year&#39;s pass and<br/>\n&gt; stay in all the state parks free after the initial fee) where there is an<br/>\n&gt; authentic Native American village built by Native Americans (not teepees!)<br/>\n&gt; and Agate Beach.  Further down the coast you come to Eureka where you will<br/>\n&gt; find the Carson Mansion, the most photographed single family residence<br/>\n&gt; (castles don&#39;t get into this category) in the world.  The next side trip<br/>\n&gt; you want to take is to Ferndale, &quot;The Victorian Village, site of many<br/>\n&gt; movies including &quot;Outbreak&quot; and &quot;Salem&#39;s Lot.&quot;  Continue south to the<br/>\n&gt; turnoff at Pepperwood which is the old highway.  There are several camping<br/>\n&gt; spaces along this 100 mile stretch.  The tallest and oldest trees are found<br/>\n&gt; here--Coastal redwoods, many of them over 300&#39; tall.  You drive right<br/>\n&gt; between them on a road that was contructed to their needs so it is rather<br/>\n&gt; squiggly, as the kidlets put it but not too bad as it is a regular on the<br/>\n&gt; motorhome route.  You can see the Grandfather Tree which stands at almost<br/>\n&gt; 300&#39;.  It has survived a lightning strike, 64&#39; flood waters, human&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; attempting to cut it down and a fire.  In each and every one of the<br/>\n&gt; pull-offs and parks in this National Forest if you sit quietly jays and<br/>\n&gt; chipmunks will come right up to the kids and you can see river otters and<br/>\n&gt; deer within 10 to 20 feet of you.  You could also take a side trip to<br/>\n&gt; Shelter Cove, also known as the Lost Coast and home of the black sand<br/>\n&gt; beaches.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then onward in a southerly direction through Mendocino County.  You might<br/>\n&gt; want to take a side trip to Fort Ross where the Russians had a settlement.<br/>\n&gt;  And then into Sonoma County (wineries by the dozens if you like) and in<br/>\n&gt; Petaluma is Vallejo&#39;s fort and in the city of Sonoma (a left off of 101 to<br/>\n&gt; the east) is Vallejo&#39;s home.  Again, southward bound and in about an hour<br/>\n&gt; you are in San Francisco.  Now, you will have to decide just how many days<br/>\n&gt; you want to spend in the greater Bay Area with sites such as the usual with<br/>\n&gt; the Zoo, Exploratorium, Aquarium, Japanese Gardens, etc. and such sites as<br/>\n&gt; the Crookedest Road in the World, the Cliff House and a million and one<br/>\n&gt; other things to do in SF, not counting Tilden Park (NOT an amusement park!)<br/>\n&gt; in the Berkeley hills, Jack London Square in Oakland, the Oakland Zoo where<br/>\n&gt; you can take a sky tram over the different animal areas (feels like they<br/>\n&gt; can reach up and touch your feet) and then on to San Jose for the<br/>\n&gt; Winchester House.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure there are lots of folks in Central and Southern CA and folks from<br/>\n&gt; the Valley that can add even more goodies that aren&#39;t amusement park type<br/>\n&gt; things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lynda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aimeesouth@...\">aimeesouth@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Homeschooling across the United States!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Date: Wednesday, June 14, 2000 6:34 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello all!
