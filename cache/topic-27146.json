I can certainly understand that you may have limited (or<br/>\nno) interest in personal opinions posted but I think we can all learn<br/>\nfrom the sources referenced.  And as we learn more, we may even be able<br/>\nto answer our children&#39;s questions with better information which must<br/>\nhave something to do with unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen again, you could just pick and choose what to read here by subject<br/>\nline.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarolyn<br/>\n<br/>\nmddch wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I agree with you.
