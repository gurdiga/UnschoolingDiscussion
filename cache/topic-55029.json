A while back Joyce (I think)<br/>\nposted something about being the person trying to help your kids get what they want rather <br/>\nthen the person standing in their way. Of course when you have two kids who both want the<br/>\nsame thing, how do you choose? Well, believe it or not, I have found recently that *not <br/>\nchoosing* can often help!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have found is, instead of me being the judge and determining what is fair (and<br/>\nbasically taking one kids side over the other), what seems to work better is to try to help<br/>\nthem talk it through. For example, if Jason (6) wants to play a computer game but Kyle<br/>\nis already playing, I used to jump in and tell Jason that he had to wait his turn (sticking<br/>\nup for Kyle who is younger etc). Now what I do is this...if Jason tries to push Kyle off<br/>\nand take the computer, I stop Jason and ask him to *ask* Kyle not just take it. Jason asks<br/>\nKyle...to my surprise, Kyle often says OK and gets off LOL! If Kyle does not want to get<br/>\noff, I will talk with Kyle a bit, explaining that Jason really wants to play etc, <br/>\n(or he will be leaving soon and just wants to play until he goes or whatever) but<br/>\nI leave it up to Kyle. If Kyle still says no, I explain Kyle&#39;s point of view (he just <br/>\ngot on or is right in the middle of a game), sympathize with Jason and try to get<br/>\nhim involved in something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe interesting thing is that since I have done this, they have gotten better at sharing<br/>\nand working things out on their own. I think that it helps because I am leaving the <br/>\ndecisions up to them, not making the decisions for them. I do not have to take one<br/>\nside over the other...rather I model how to present their arguments to the other. <br/>\nThe rule here for the computer is that the person playing can play as long as they<br/>\nlike. If it seems like Kyle (or Jason) has been playing for a long time and the<br/>\nother still wants to play, I will help them make their argument, but still leave it<br/>\nup the person playing. Jason has been figuring out that Kyle is more likely to give<br/>\nhim a turn if Jason lets Kyle have a turn. I have heard them work things out more on<br/>\ntheir own (often using the same words that I have used). And sometimes they come up<br/>\nwith solutions that I never would have thought of. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt does not work perfectly, but for the most part it has helped improve how they <br/>\nhandle things. I am not sure how well I explained what we do, I hope that it made<br/>\nsense. In a nutshell, I do not take one kids side over the other and I help them see<br/>\nthe others point of view by talking it out with them and letting them make the decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":134954462,"authorName":"ed hodgins","from":"&quot;ed hodgins&quot; &lt;ed.hodgins@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] kids taking things from each other","postDate":"1042684373","msgId":55277,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTQwMWMyYmQwNyQ5MmVjMGZjMCQ5YTdiZTQ0MEB5b3VydXM2N3BpNmx1dj4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMmMwMWMyYmM3NCQwMWJkY2Y0MCRkYjk2MWI0MUB5b3VyNXJscDNhOTUxNj4="},"prevInTopic":55259,"nextInTopic":55295,"prevInTime":55276,"nextInTime":55278,"topicId":55029,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I have been just reading a few emails. I have been<br/>\nconsidering homeschooling or unschooling. My son is 18 mth and daughter is 2<br/>\nalmost 3. She seems a bit a head of her age though. She wants some of his<br/>\ntoys. So I give a more grown up toy or distract her by getting her to help<br/>\nme. I dont know maybe some kind of distraction or fun activity like a<br/>\ncomputer game or movie. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128307542,"authorName":"Earthmomma67@aol.com","from":"Earthmomma67@...","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] kids taking things from each other","postDate":"1042670789","msgId":55259,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyYy4yMDc3NDBmYi4yYjU3M2VjNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55248,"nextInTopic":55277,"prevInTime":55258,"nextInTime":55260,"topicId":55029,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/15/03 4:52:30 PM Eastern Standard Time, grlynbl@aol.com ...
