They really saved me at<br/>\none<br/>\ntime.  I found that while I was confident that my children would learn to<br/>\nread on<br/>\ntheir own when they were ready, that they were not so confident. It seemed<br/>\nalmost<br/>\nimpossible for them at times to ever believe that they could learn to read,<br/>\nit was<br/>\nmuch like what a foreign language might look like to an adult. I really<br/>\nstruggled<br/>\nwith protecting them and their self esteem as they get older and realise<br/>\nother children<br/>\ntheir age or younger are reading. I would explain how those children<br/>\npracticed reading<br/>\nevery day from 5 yrs old on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I can sort of understand where they were<br/>\ncoming from. I know that sometimes when there are things I &quot;think&quot; are<br/>\ntoo hard for me or doesn&#39;t come naturally or easily, I just don&#39;t want to do<br/>\nor<br/>\nlearn them.  Like learning how to run our business if anything every<br/>\nhappened to my<br/>\ndh. I have a friend who said of course I would and I was absolutely sure<br/>\nthat<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t do it!  Then I thought, maybe she is right, maybe I could. Now I<br/>\nam a<br/>\npretty confident person, but there are some real technical, mechanical and<br/>\nphysical aspects of the job that &quot;I think&quot; I would just not &quot;get&quot; (kinda<br/>\nlike how<br/>\nsome folks shut down with &quot;math&quot;). The very idea terrifies me, scares me so<br/>\nmuch<br/>\nI would almost rather give up (the business) than<br/>\ntake a chance and apply myself.  And sometimes I think thats where my<br/>\nchildren<br/>\nwere with reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce they got that everything they were doing, asking<br/>\nhow to write a word, what sound does this word make, what does this say<br/>\nwere all leading to reading.  My dd will be 10 in two weeks and has just in<br/>\nthe<br/>\npast couple of weeks started to read &quot;pretty well&quot;.  She is into Calvin and<br/>\nHobbes<br/>\n(purchased on the off chance she might find those more interesting than any<br/>\nother<br/>\nstory/chapter book we have, and they were).  But, she has been wanting to<br/>\nread<br/>\nsince she was 6!  It was not an easy process for her. It was not an<br/>\neffortless<br/>\nprocess for her.  My son, who is 8.5 is just now starting to want to read<br/>\n(since last fall maybe) and getting it much quicker than his sister was at<br/>\nthat<br/>\nage. My 6 yr old will probably be reading sooner than the first two, he<br/>\nseems<br/>\nto have the motivation without the fear or realisation that that is what<br/>\nother<br/>\nkids his age are doing.  So to make a long story longer, I don&#39;t know how<br/>\nwe protect our kids from the self-esteem issues of knowing other kids their<br/>\nage are reading and its ok for them not to be reading now.  Anyone have any<br/>\nsuggestions for that?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing I did tell my son when he was feeling<br/>\ndown about not reading I asked him some questions:  does J being able to<br/>\nread<br/>\nmake him a better cub scout than you? does he say the scouts pledge better<br/>\nthan you? has he earned more awards than you have?  does reading make<br/>\nhim a better motorcycle rider than you? etc. etc.  that seemed to help him<br/>\na lot also.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] feelings about reading","postDate":"1058923258","msgId":77365,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc0LjMwN2M5YjZkLjJjNGYzY2ZhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":77288,"nextInTopic":77677,"prevInTime":77364,"nextInTime":77366,"topicId":77249,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/22/03 5:49:10 AM, felesina@cwnet.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-731589134\">In a message dated 7/22/03 5:49:10 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:felesina@...\">felesina@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Anyway..

We did a few chapters (ignoring their weird notations, <br/>\njust reading the lists and samples), and they frustrated her, so she tried <br/>\nsometimes and said no sometimes, and I didn&#39;t press.  I kept her busy and <br/>\ndistracted and read to her when necessary and gradually (kind of suddenly, but <br/>\ngradually within that few months) it came together for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think the books helped except to show her that reading lesson books <br/>\naren&#39;t magic nor even very sensible things.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice is get that book if he seems interested, make lists of the words he <br/>\nDOES know (maybe put them on 3x5 cards) and as he sees how many he does know, <br/>\nhe might feel better.

But if, for example, you <br/>\nhave a dog named  Flipper (we used to) maybe you could put on the back of that <br/>\nother words (not ALL of them, but a  few) like sipper, skipper, zipper.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe read to him what Carol Rice wrote about her son Liam, which is here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/reading\">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] feelings about reading","postDate":"1058887270","msgId":77288,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMGQwMWMzNTA2NCRlNDM1Zjk0MCRlNDZlNmMxOEBndi5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwNTg4NjExMTIuMTkyMS45NDA1NS5tNEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDwwMDRhMDFjMzUwNDckOWUxZTZjYzAkOGM4MzUxNDJAZmVsZXNpbmE+"},"prevInTopic":77249,"nextInTopic":77365,"prevInTime":77287,"nextInTime":77289,"topicId":77249,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... feels ... just ... a ... or ... letters ...
