I had been planning to talk to him anyway, since even the way they got <br/>\ninto cars had an oddity.  So he told me what he was unhappy about, we talked <br/>\nat home and on the way taking him to work.  I played devil&#39;s advocate, taking <br/>\nthe other kids&#39; sides, and bringing up potential justifications for their <br/>\nattitudes and actions.  And I told him stories of himself to remind him that <br/>\nsometimes those things happen with NO malice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMonday morning, I asked him if he felt better about it.  He said not really.  <br/>\nSo I said he should find something fun and distraction to do that would make <br/>\nhim laugh, because if he stays sad and focussed on frustration too many days <br/>\nin a row it&#39;s harder to recover and get cheerful again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he seems sad again today, I&#39;ll probably get him to go do something with me <br/>\n(we have real reasons to need to go shopping or on other errands) and I&#39;ll <br/>\nconsciously keep the conversation OFF that other topic, bring up happier <br/>\nthings, maybe go rent a new comedy  he hasn&#39;t seen.  He wants to watch <br/>\nUnbreakable, but that&#39;s not cheery, so I won&#39;t suggest that one if he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nbring it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;ll feed him protein.  Some days he&#39;s wholly on his own.  Some days <br/>\nthere&#39;s one fixed-meal.  But today I won&#39;t let him get hungry, because he has <br/>\na specific need just as if he were sick with the flu.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis social awareness didn&#39;t benefit him this time.  Two of the other kids who <br/>\nare less concerned with nuances of interpersonal relations just said Kirby <br/>\nover-reacts and should get over it.  But I see it as Kirby having an ability <br/>\nwhich USUALLY is beneficial to the group, but this time worked against him.  <br/>\nHe wasn&#39;t able to &quot;just ignore&quot; what was so glaring to him, and neither was <br/>\nhe able to subtly turn the situation a better way as he often can do.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe hurt his shoulder and couldn&#39;t figure out how.  I asked if it was the <br/>\nmechanical bull.  He hadn&#39;t thought of that, but other kids told me he had <br/>\n&quot;dashboarded&quot; (hit his head on the bull), and that he was good natured about <br/>\nit and not too embarrassed.  But that could easily have been the shoulder <br/>\ninjury too.  So today he teaches karate at 4:15, has his own regular class at <br/>\n5:00, and ordinarily would stay two more hours for the adult kobudo (weapons) <br/>\nclass, but he said last night he wants to come home at 6:00 instead of 8:00 <br/>\nbecause of the shoulder.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m happy with his handling of these various difficulties, but I think given <br/>\nhis own biochemistry that he&#39;ll be better equipped to get happier sooner if <br/>\nhe has more than the usual amount of protein today.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9440128,"authorName":"ElissaJC@concentric.net","from":"&lt;ElissaJC@...&gt;","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: ask again, or remind us where in the discussion it was, please","postDate":"1031659980","msgId":43569,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwN2IwMWMyNThjMyQ2OTA2OTAyMCQwNDJhMDM0MEBFbGlzc2FKQz4="},"prevInTopic":43568,"nextInTopic":43584,"prevInTime":43568,"nextInTime":43570,"topicId":43435,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Someone said here recently something","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1827752991\">&lt;&lt;Maybe I should say, have I totally blown it in having communicated that<br/>\nbelief to my kids, since I already have? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone said here recently something similar to:<br/>\nI don&#39;t make the choice for them but I sure will give my opinion!<br/>\nI tell my kids my opinion about many things, and usually give the other side<br/>\ntoo.

Yet your problem involves hitting and not having self <br/>\ncontrol.  So I wondered what a good response would be like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had already described in great detail our methods about hitting.  The <br/>\nconversation had been for what seemed days about &quot;what if Kirby HITS Marty, <br/>\nand I had no more to say about it than I had already, in detail, said.  When <br/>\nthat was a problem I would say &quot;Did you talk about it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Did you ask for a grownup&#39;s help?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Then you shouldn&#39;t have hit him.  FIRST talk, then get a grownup.  If that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help, THEN you can hit him.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anything the girl can do to keep the situation from escalating?  <br/>\nThey won&#39;t be six and eight forever, not even for another year.  She will <br/>\ndevelop better communication skills.  He will develop better self control.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I just can&#39;t seem to get him to come to me or<br/>\nsay something to her first. His first reaction is to pop her one.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he really, truly, can&#39;t even talk to her first, I would tell him he can&#39;t <br/>\nplay with her,, and I would tell her not to get within arm&#39;s length of him <br/>\nunless a grownup was there.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I would make a joke of it, and make it sweet and as funny as possible, <br/>\nand say, &quot;Oh no... Kirby might get dangerous, so you sit over here and just <br/>\ntalk to him.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would talk to her about recognizing the danger signals when he was losing <br/>\nit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it possible that he&#39;s needing more protein in his diet?  Kirby and I both <br/>\nare quick to get headaches if we don&#39;t have protein and three meals a day are <br/>\nnot enough.  Between meal protein snacks are good preventative for the <br/>\nKirby-grumpies, and even now that he&#39;s older, I try to remember to slip him a <br/>\nsnack if there&#39;s a many-hours stretch from one meal to another.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you said you had tried all kinds of things but didn&#39;t say what they <br/>\nwere, I&#39;m hesitant to give the best few I can think of because you probably <br/>\nalready tried them..<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s why your post was very hard to respond to.
