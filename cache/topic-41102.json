And always jammed with interesting and<br/>\nthought-provoking dialogue.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the topic of insurance for an older unschooler - I have tackled this in<br/>\nmy own way. . . both for the insane realm of health insurance and the<br/>\ndifficult realm of child support. I enrolled my son in Clonlara. I know it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t fit into the supposed outline of unschooling, but we needed to do<br/>\nsomething in order to satisfy the bureaucracy as to the &quot;authenticity&quot; of<br/>\nhis schooling endeavors. This did it - he got a school ID card and a letter<br/>\nfrom Clonlara saying that he was enrolled. It  cost $500, but this was far<br/>\nless than the alternative of loosing insurance and/or child support. Now,<br/>\nmy son is continuing his own education in his own creative way . . . we are<br/>\ncurrently preparing a &quot;portfolio&quot; of his endeavors (which, by the way,<br/>\nlooks nothing short of stellar - another unschooling shining star!). He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know where his studies will take him, we remain unattached - but<br/>\nthe &#39;authorities&#39; are satisfied.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this is helpful - and by the way, would that unschooled 19 year old<br/>\nson be interested in dialoguing with another 19 year old unschooled young<br/>\nman? Contact off list, if so.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn aloha, Lee<br/>\nNorth Country Farms<br/>\nAn Organic Family Farm & Tropical B&B Cottages<br/>\n        . . . an eco-tourism destination . . . <br/>\nP.O.
