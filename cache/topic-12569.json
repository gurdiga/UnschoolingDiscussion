It is a very<br/>\ndifficult subject for everyone to discuss, but come on.  As far as someone who<br/>\nis a &quot;hick&quot; and someone can&#39;t believe they actually homeschool.  As far as I am<br/>\nconcerned, the Lord has directed me  to homeschool.  You have to be an<br/>\nintelligent, loving parent to want to stay home with your child and be in charge<br/>\nof their future as far as working at McDonald&#39;s or as an attorney.  To do such<br/>\nan important and amazing thing, you are by far, not a &quot;hick&quot;.  To even decide to<br/>\ndo this, you are in a way, above others who don&#39;t.  All of us on here care about<br/>\nour children.  I am not saying we are better than anyone else.  We just love our<br/>\nchildren.  Therefore, this list should be a loving helpful group of friends who<br/>\ntalk about how there day is going and an occasional debate is fine, but this<br/>\nname calling is for the public school system.  We should all be there for each<br/>\nother and help with the day to day problems of homeschooling.  How would you<br/>\nlook to your kids if they got on here and read the name calling?  Would you not<br/>\nset such a sorry example for them?  Just speaking my opinion.  Tired of the junk<br/>\nI am reading.

I was hysterical. I needed to hold<br/>\n&gt; still so she could stop the bleeding. I couldn&#39;t even hear her saying &quot;Stop!<br/>\n&gt; Hold still!&quot; over my own frightened screaming. (I cut myself trying to make<br/>\n&gt; lunch.) She gave me one simple stinging swat on the tush and it brought me<br/>\n&gt; back to earth. She didn&#39;t care about cleaning up the mess. She knew she<br/>\n&gt; needed to stop the bleeding. And she was certainly used to my strong<br/>\n&gt; emotions. If she had had a problem with that, I would have received a lot<br/>\n&gt; more than 3 spankings in my entire life. Not a control issue at all, unless<br/>\n&gt; you count first-aid as a control issue. The spanking was a simple attention<br/>\n&gt; getter. No ill effects and no therapy needed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----Valerie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"oB60VXxlsZMUc_ceGhb0iGxr1bm07cyzIfIoXJE-5Z-CGk7oxYYXsSPvHiepgkdSKY7BbEuM34PFYUZhBi-r4iX-iA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Spanking","postDate":"968085805","msgId":12607,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwOTA0MTcwNS5lODRINWZiMTY4ODNAc20wMTAxLnByb21lZGlhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":12580,"nextInTopic":12612,"prevInTime":12606,"nextInTime":12608,"topicId":12569,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Perhaps one was hysterical because one had never been held to make the bad go away.

Kidlet #4 has been an accident that doesn&#39;t wait to happen since<br/>\nbirth.  No hysteria when he slid down a slide and landed on glass that<br/>\nripped the sole of his foot open from toes to heel, he screamed for someone<br/>\nto get his mom cause he knew mommy would fix it.  Screaming or hysteria,<br/>\nwhat&#39;s the difference, you ask, well, the difference is that he had to<br/>\nscream to be heard over the noise in the park.  Eldest son tipped over<br/>\nusing his bed for a trampoline and split his head open and hit a<br/>\nspurter--blood all over the bed, walls, window.  No hysteria, just a get<br/>\nmom.  #2 son split his eyebrow open (17 stitches) and didn&#39;t get<br/>\nhysterical, just called for mommy to fix it.  Oh, did I mention they were<br/>\nall 4 and 5 years old.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I&#39;ve never had any problem stopping hysteria by simply holding a child<br/>\ntight and crooning to them, including those that weren&#39;t mine!
