A little bit at a time.  He swallows it easier. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever I just talked to the kids, Alyssa esp., it is bothering her the most.  I told her I let the list know what was being required of us, and also the things you suggested about doing while we did the worksheets, sit back and relax, that we are still unschoolers.  She thought we wouldn&#39;t be unschoolers anymore, and would not be allowed to any more conferences LOL.  Well I have a better perspective about it, and it seems he is happy if we only sit and do it once or twice a week.  Great suggestions.  I was just thinking drudgery drudgery just when I was starting to feel so free.

My husband (who is step-dad to my kids) has been supportive of <br/>\nour homeschooling lifestyle since we met 7 years ago and the children were 3 and <br/>\n7.  He happily went to the conference with us last year and although I had <br/>\ntalked about unschooling some I think he still expected a &quot;homeschool <br/>\nconference&quot;  where I have actually sprinted out of speeches where someone was talking <br/>\nabout how to train up their children.  It was the beginning of our unschooling <br/>\njourney and he came away from the conference as the children and I did.<br/>\nWe felt like we had found a home.....a place where we belonged.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThese past few months have been so exciting and freeing for all of us.  I <br/>\ncould never have explained it all to him if he had not been there.  It wasn&#39;t so <br/>\nmuch the speakers (although they were superb) but the little moments on the <br/>\nelevators with wide-eyed giggling children, teenagers with their skateboards who <br/>\ntook the time to talk to us and the acceptance that I felt in every <br/>\nconversation I had with total strangers who by the end of the weekend felt like <br/>\nfriends.  I know my husband is glad he went and we&#39;ll all be there again this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nGail<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":144628419,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"&quot;Kelli Traaseth&quot; &lt;tktraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Dads","postDate":"1073944563","msgId":88585,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmUwMWMzZDk1NiRlOGI0ZTU1MCRhMjMzMTlhY0B5b3VyZ2c4N3Zxem96cT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTEyLjEzMzg0Ni4xOTA0LjE0LmRkemltbGV3QGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":88575,"nextInTopic":88592,"prevInTime":88584,"nextInTime":88586,"topicId":58897,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So that he wouldn&#39;t take it personal or I wouldn&#39;t get emotional or something like that.   One big point that really struck home with my hubby was, &quot;would you speak that way to a friend of yours?&quot;  The whole respect thing was something that he never considered, yet it really made so much sense when I pointed it out.  (I think it was one of Joyce&#39;s posts that really hit home for him.  Thanks, Joyce!) <br/>\n<br/>\n  He read about not requiring chores, dealing with others questions, how great these unschooled kids were turning out,  all sorts of stories.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He is now a wonderful unschooling advocate!

Conferences are rarely for people new to things though they can be a great intro. Conferences and conventions seem to me to be mostly places where people who&#39;ve been involved in a certain thing for years go to get inspired and trade knowledge. If I was a brain surgeon I certainly wouldn&#39;t be staying home from brain surgery conferences. I&#39;d go to keep informed and in the loop. It&#39;s also a chance to socialize and party with a bunch of people who share a particular interest, just plain fun. <br/>\n<br/>\n  dawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion]  Dads","postDate":"1073860126","msgId":88460,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PGYuMjAzM2VlYzYuMmQzMzFlMjJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":88458,"nextInTopic":88471,"prevInTime":88459,"nextInTime":88461,"topicId":58897,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1701827677\">&lt;&lt;My DH has been great but he does not share my passion.

Sometimes even more so than I am; on some<br/>\nparticular issues, such as what could broadly be called &quot;Jayn&#39;s health&quot; he<br/>\nwants to be a bit more controlling and coercive (nb health issues in this<br/>\ncase does NOT include food which he is completely free about). However, it<br/>\nactually took the last conference for me to really understand and believe<br/>\nthat my darling sweetheart really does get it, and believe in unschooling<br/>\nand freedom with his whole soul. He is much better than me at dealing with<br/>\nother people who don&#39;t understand how we are living. Last summer Jayn had<br/>\nbeen doing a lot of screaming, which bugged our neighbor. Having her telling<br/>\nJayn not to scream, while playing, only made Jayn laugh and scream louder.<br/>\nShe later complained that Jayn shouldn&#39;t be allowed to scream ever, and<br/>\nJames just calmly told her that &quot;this is where she is right now&quot;. (I should<br/>\nadd that we discourage it when Jayn is outside since it does echo around the<br/>\nbuilding. The apartments are soundproofed so inside it doesn&#39;t carry from<br/>\ninside our place - plus she seems to have outgrown the need.) It&#39;s the old<br/>\npot calling the kettle black btw - you should hear her screaming for her<br/>\ndogs to come in! Doesn&#39;t bother me, except in the raised eyebrow of irony<br/>\nthat she complains about other people&#39;s noises.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Anyone who knew him <br/>\nthought the same. He was the best as a father. Never a harsh word to me of <br/>\nany kind. Very giving and kind. Honest, hard working and loved by literally <br/>\neveryone who knew him. My friends adored my dad. Our whole town did. When he <br/>\npassed, there was a line around the block of people who came to pay their <br/>\nrespects. It was quite a show of how much he meant to so many. Now that I <br/>\nlook at this, these words just don&#39;t do enough. His passing has changed my <br/>\nlife.
