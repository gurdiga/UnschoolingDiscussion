I thought the post was well done.<br/>\n  I also thought the discussion was going well. Lots of sharing how posters<br/>\n  felt about the subject.  I&#39;ve *always* been outside any cliques. Never in<br/>\n  the inner cicle, anytime, anywhere. Probably never will. I don&#39;t feel there<br/>\n  is one here. Frequent posters, sometime posters and lurkers. Info, advice,<br/>\n  sharing, family life stories and websites, comfort and celebrating. That&#39;s<br/>\n  what I see here. Now one more opinion to add to the mix. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Barb E<br/>\n  &quot;Ideas won&#39;t keep; something must be done about them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Alfred North Whitehead, Mathematician and philosopher<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  on 8/9/03 1:05 PM, Nancy Liedel at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:naliedel@...\">naliedel@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Kelly, <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; I get the point and I am unsubscribing.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
