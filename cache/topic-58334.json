Even the old joke, &quot;How do you get a <br/>\nguitar player to turn his amp down?&quot;  (put a lead sheet in front of him), <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really apply.  The jazz players I know (lots here in the NYC and <br/>\nsurrounding area) have heavy theory backgrounds and are great readers.  A <br/>\ngood friend of mine who played the tenor sax was from the old school (a <br/>\nplayer from the 50s).  He played well into his 90s.  He never went to <br/>\ncollege or anything like that, but he could read, too.  Although you can <br/>\nfind fake books for E-flat and B-flat instruments, most of the time you&#39;d <br/>\nalways see the sax player looking over the guitar player&#39;s or piano <br/>\nplayer&#39;s or bass player&#39;s shoulder at a fake book that was written for C <br/>\ninstruments, and you just know that guy is transposing not only the melody <br/>\nof the tune but then when it comes to soloing, he&#39;s transposing the cords <br/>\nand transposing the harmony and modes.  Yikes!  It&#39;s hard for me to imagine <br/>\ndoing, but these folks do it all the time and it&#39;s just second nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] music, again","postDate":"1044841979","msgId":58369,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExYi4xZGY5ZDZmNS4yYjc4NWZmYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58361,"nextInTopic":58374,"prevInTime":58368,"nextInTime":58370,"topicId":58334,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/9/03 12:03:37 PM, litlrooh@comcast.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-86644959\">In a message dated 2/9/03 12:03:37 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:litlrooh@...\">litlrooh@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I guess what I meant was, if a score is written with an orchestra in mind, <br/>\nand there is a player of a transposing instrument, the musical notation will <br/>\neither be adjusted for them, or they will just adjust it in their heads as <br/>\nthey go, since they are used to playing that particular instrument and are <br/>\naccustomed to the transposition problem. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t do the transposing.
