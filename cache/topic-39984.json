Hmm. That seems true of<br/>\nhomeschooling. He goes on: &quot;In this medium you must be willing to<br/>\nplay the role of both patient director and alert stagehand, while the<br/>\npigment and water are free to perform their magic. Try to push this<br/>\nmedium around, and it quickly loses its charm, its transparent<br/>\nradiance and its life.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm again. How often have we advised parents to act as facilitators<br/>\nrather than directors of their children&#39;s&#39; learning? I know I&#39;ve<br/>\noften written that learning happens best when the learner is<br/>\nencouraged rather than instructed. These were interesting parallels:<br/>\nthe comparisons between what MacKenzie was telling me about painting<br/>\nand what we&#39;ve been telling parents about homeschooling for 20 years.<br/>\nMacKenzie explains &quot;...Unlike a book of rules that tend to close our<br/>\nminds, this is a collection of principles, concepts, and general<br/>\ninformation designed to expand the creative process.&quot; He writes that<br/>\nmuch of his material is based on &quot;common sense, visual perception,<br/>\nand your own innate sense of design.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve often written that homeschooling is based on common sense,<br/>\nparental perception, and one&#39;s own innate sense of what one&#39;s<br/>\nchildren need. MacKenzie goes on: &quot;We all embrace an individual sense<br/>\nof what &#39;feels right&#39; that also seems to reflect an unconscious<br/>\nuniversal consensus.&quot; This made sense to me when I thought about how<br/>\nnew homeschooling parents almost instinctively know how to teach<br/>\ntheir kids to read, or how little advanced mathematics is really<br/>\nnecessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nMacKenzie advises, &quot;The hardest part about this is believing in your<br/>\nability to do it. The second hardest part is shutting off that little<br/>\nleft-brain voice that says &#39;This is stupid. It won&#39;t work.&#39; It takes<br/>\ncourage to step into the unknown and trust what you find...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many times have I written those very words to parents worried<br/>\nabout whether or not their children will ever learn to read? It takes<br/>\ncourage to step into the unknown. And yet just as MacKenzie advises<br/>\nme to let go and trust the process of water and paint and paper, so<br/>\nI&#39;ve often advised parents to let go and trust the process of<br/>\nchildren and exploring and learning. If letting go of a little paint<br/>\nand water takes courage, how much more courage must be involved when<br/>\none knows the letting go will affect their child&#39;s future?<br/>\n~~ Excerpt from Helen Hegener&#39;s Publisher&#39;s Note in the July/August<br/>\nissue of HEM ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can read the rest of this colorful column, as well as a couple of<br/>\narticles and columns from the July/August issue at the address above,<br/>\nbut you&#39;ll have to get the magazine--the one you hold in your<br/>\nhands--to read them all!

I just had a flashback! Before our unschooling days, my<br/>\n5-yr-old DS and I were in the lunchbox aisle in Wal-Mart and he was<br/>\npicking out his lunchbox for school. As he was standing there holding<br/>\nit, it suddenly dawned on me (with much force) that he and I would no<br/>\nlonger be eating lunch together. I broke down and cried, right on the<br/>\nspot. Later that evening when his dad got home, he said, &#39;Mama cried<br/>\nin Wal-Mart today.&#39; My husband looked duly concerned and asked me,<br/>\n&#39;Why? What happened?&#39; And my sweet little son replied, &#39;Because I get<br/>\nto go to school and she doesn&#39;t.&#39; Of course he was thinking that he<br/>\nwas going to a wonderful place. He had a very different opinion after<br/>\nthe very first day, and told me &#39;Mom, I think you were crying in<br/>\nWal-Mart that day for a different reason.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is now well into his teens and we did go shopping this week for<br/>\nsome new goodies. But it was SO NICE to just all go home together<br/>\nagain and BE together and use our new stuff! You should see my house.<br/>\nStuff strewn all over the place. You can&#39;t find the carpet. Or the<br/>\nwalls, either. Art &#39;masterpieces&#39; stuck all over the place.&quot; ~~ Ginny<br/>\non one of the unschooling.com message boards ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling.com offers a free monthly newsletter, message boards, an<br/>\nemail list and more just for unschoolers.

I<br/>\nsee those ads for back-to-school clothes and supplies, the ones where<br/>\nthe parents can&#39;t wait for the kids to go back and the kids aren&#39;t<br/>\nreally so happy about it, and I feel sad. When those busses start<br/>\nrunning, I&#39;m always thankful my kids aren&#39;t on them, looking like the<br/>\nkids who gaze out the windows with unhappy, glazed-over faces because<br/>\nthey don&#39;t want to be taken away on the big banana.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I know some kids like school. But for all of those kids who<br/>\njust want to escape and can&#39;t see any way out, I sure wish their<br/>\nparents would take advantage of what I think is the best educational<br/>\nchoice a family can make--living and learning together as a family.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis month, celebrate back-to-school-NOT.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>\n<br/>\nWe think parents and kids should be together!

Our award-winning website contains a wealth of<br/>\nfirst-hand information about homeschooling, written from a variety of<br/>\nviewpoints. In keeping with our mission statement, NHEN espouses no<br/>\none particular political agenda or homeschooling philosophy.<br/>\nInstead, we know that homeschooling parents can read all of the<br/>\nmaterial and determine for themselves what is best for their family.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn response to media requests, we help reporters find accurate,<br/>\nbalanced information about homeschooling and put them in touch with<br/>\nNHEN members who have previously indicated a willingness to be<br/>\ninterviewed. Information and interviews provided by NHEN contacts<br/>\nhave appeared in articles in Time, on National Public Radio, and<br/>\nother national, state, and local media.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll homeschoolers are invited to participate in our network. NHEN<br/>\nmembership is free. By joining NHEN you will add your voice to those<br/>\nof thousands of other homeschoolers who have approved our mission<br/>\nstatement. NHEN operates only through volunteer contributions. Once<br/>\nyou&#39;ve joined, be sure to read the NHENotes and find out how you<br/>\ncould help!  NHEN T-shirts, fanny packs, and tote bags are also<br/>\navailable for sale.

No, the FlyLady doesn&#39;t really<br/>\nhave anything to do with homeschooling or flying for that matter, but<br/>\na lot of homeschoolers swear by her program for keeping their houses<br/>\nmanageable. Let&#39;s face it. We live in our houses. Very few<br/>\nhomeschoolers go out to a job for 8-10 hours every day and come home<br/>\nto a clean house. We live in our homes all day, every day, except<br/>\nwhen we&#39;re running out the door leaving the peanut butter, jelly and<br/>\nbread open on the counter for the dog to drag down and eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nFlyLady can help you tame the dirty clutter monster. She sends a<br/>\ndaily motivational email, the backbone of the program, and offers a<br/>\ndetailed plan on her website for getting control and keeping control<br/>\nin an hour a day or less. Starting out as a &quot;FlyBaby,&quot; you are<br/>\ninstructed to &quot;get dressed to your shoes&quot; every morning, take a 15<br/>\nminute break every hour, laugh every day, clean one zone (out of 5<br/>\nrotating zones) every week, hit the Hot Spots, 5-minute room rescues<br/>\nand perform the entertaining 27 Fling Boogie. (I can vouch for the<br/>\ndressing to your shoes part. It&#39;s really easy as homeschoolers to<br/>\nstay in our PJs and never really feel ready to start on those<br/>\ndrudgery chores. Dressing to your shoes makes a bigger difference<br/>\nthan you would think.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNot everybody takes to the FlyLady. Some of us have our own routines<br/>\nand we&#39;re happy with how our houses look. But I know a number of<br/>\nhomeschoolers who feel she&#39;s saved their lives by giving them some<br/>\nstructure and a reason to get started in the morning. Me, I wish<br/>\nshe&#39;d just come and clean my house for me!
