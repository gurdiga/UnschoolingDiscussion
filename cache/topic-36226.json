It&#39;s<br/>\nactually quite simple.  All that&#39;s required is *explaining* the child&#39;s<br/>\nbehavior.  What is the child trying to accomplish?  Why does ey want to do<br/>\n[horrible thing X]?  This lends itself to many simple solutions.  How else<br/>\ncould child accomplish eir goal?  Let me use an example to illustrate.  Ben<br/>\nis 4 years old, and his mother, Olivia, has taken him to a toy store where<br/>\nhe is playing with toys.  Olivia wishes to leave a 4pm, with Ben, to go to<br/>\nthe airport to meet her spouse and drive him home.  So:  What if Ben doesn&#39;<br/>\nt want to leave at 4pm?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point most parents would assert that &quot;whiny children can&#39;t always<br/>\nhave their way,&quot; and carry Ben, kicking and screaming, to the car, where<br/>\nthey strap him in (reminiscent of mental institutes who tie up their<br/>\npatients) and drive off.  Coercing children is so common that kicking and<br/>\nscreaming do not seem to alarm parents.  These behaviors, last resorts to<br/>\nalert parent eir behavior is problematic, and even attempts to physically<br/>\nstop or hurt parent, amazingly, do not set off warning bells that something<br/>\nis going wrong.  Of course, something is very wrong.  So, let us apply my<br/>\ngeneral solution.  Explain why Ben wants to stay.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Olivia forgot to tell Ben in advance that they would be leaving.  He is<br/>\nplaying with a toy and suddenly is whisked off in an instant.  Ben simply<br/>\nneeded some advanced warning of when they would leave.  Alternately, Olivia<br/>\ntold Ben they would be leaving at 4pm, but didn&#39;t give any useful warnings,<br/>\nsuch as reminding Ben at 3:30, 3:45, 3:50, and 3:55.*<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, this is Olivia&#39;s fault.  How would she like it if she were involved<br/>\nin some great project and, without warning, she was forced to stop?  Not at<br/>\nall!  Projects are important for everyone, and disrupting projects is quite<br/>\nharmful to the learning process.  The solution is that Ben needs a warning<br/>\nbefore they go, so Olivia should simply tell him that they need to go as<br/>\nsoon as possible, and then wait for Ben to finish his current project.<br/>\nFather can wait.  If Ben is going to need a significant amount of time,<br/>\nOlivia can call father and explain the situation.  Then he can take a taxi<br/>\nhome if he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Olivia did not forget to give Ben warnings.  But Ben misjudged the time<br/>\nand is in the middle of a project at 4pm.  Olivia wants to go, and feels<br/>\nshe has done nothing wrong.  Now what?*<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, let Ben finish his project.  Did he choose to have a rigid<br/>\nappointment his calendar?  No.  Even if he &quot;agreed&quot; at the time, he didn&#39;t<br/>\nmean it, or understand what it would entail.  Olivia should not force rigid<br/>\nschedules on her son.  As before, she can call and tell father, and he can<br/>\ntake a cab if necessary (or wait, or call a friend to pick him up, or any<br/>\nnumber of other solutions).<br/>\n<br/>\n*Ben really likes a certain toy.*<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, buy the toy and take it with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Ben just wants his way.*<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is not a zero-sum game.  Families shouldn&#39;t be parents against<br/>\nchildren, mother against son.  If this explanation is actually true, and I<br/>\ndoubt it is, it must be because Ben has by systematically coerced for much<br/>\nof his life, denied his wants, and taught (by living it out) that life is a<br/>\nbattle for each person to try to force eir way.  The solution is to never,<br/>\never initiate force against one&#39;s child, and to explain that life is not a<br/>\nzero-sum game.  If Ben hates Olivia, finding a CP will be very hard.  This<br/>\nis all the more reason to use TCS in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Isn&#39;t this letting the child coerce the parent?  Don&#39;t parents have<br/>\nrights?  Why is Ben allowed to violate Olivia&#39;s rights?*<br/>\n<br/>\nThis objection has false premises.  Olivia is thinking &quot;I want to leave,<br/>\nbut I can&#39;t because of Ben, so he is coercing me to not leave.&quot;  But she is<br/>\nwrong.  She could leave.  And Ben could stay where he is.  Everyone has a<br/>\nright to determine where to be.  If she was with a friend, this is what<br/>\nwould happen.  Attentive readers are probably now screaming at me that<br/>\nOlivia can&#39;t leave Ben behind.  Well, they&#39;re right, but this is hardly Ben<br/>\n&#39;s doing.  What Olivia is actually resenting is her own parental<br/>\nobligations that she created of her own free will by having a child.  To<br/>\nblame Ben for her own obligations, taken on by choice, is unfair.  So no,<br/>\nBen is not coercing Olivia; she is simply resenting her past choices.  This<br/>\nis her own personal problem, and she is obligated to keep it from Ben as<br/>\nbest she can.  She should sort it out herself (and with any friend who<br/>\nwants to listen or help).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNew situation.  Ben is hitting another child, Sue, with a baseball bat.  (I<br/>\nknow this sounds crazy, but I was recently asked exactly this.)  Well, now<br/>\nwhat?  Explain it!<br/>\n<br/>\n*Coercion damage.*<br/>\n<br/>\nPractice TCS.  Figure out what entrenched theory is causing the hitting (in<br/>\nother words, get a more detailed explanation).  Now rationally criticize<br/>\nthis theory and offer some alternatives so that Ben can improve his<br/>\nworldview.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Ben likes hitting things with baseball bats.*<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, get him something else to hit, like a sandbag.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Ben likes hitting noisy things with baseball bats.*<br/>\n<br/>\nGet a sandbag and an audiocassette with appropriate sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Ben likes hitting noisy things that move with baseball bats.*<br/>\n<br/>\nFind or build an appropriate toy/structure.  Or maybe suggest that baseball<br/>\n(or t-ball) is much more fun, and let Ben try that.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Ben is mad at Sue.*<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is Ben mad at Sue?  A better explanation is necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Ben is mad at Sue because Sue took Ben&#39;s toy truck.*<br/>\n<br/>\nGet Ben&#39;s truck back.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Ben is mad at Sue because she has cooties.*<br/>\n<br/>\nExplain that cooties don&#39;t exist.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Ben is mad at Sue because she is ugly.*<br/>\n<br/>\nExplain that initiating force is wrong.  Offer Ben some pretty pictures to<br/>\nlook at.  Explain that Sue can&#39;t control her appearance.  Explain that<br/>\nhitting Sue with a baseball bat does not make her pretty.  Try to find<br/>\npretty friends for Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Ben is mad at Sue because she called him stupid.*<br/>\n<br/>\nExplain to Ben that Sue is mean and wrong.  Explain that hitting her with<br/>\nthe bat doesn&#39;t solve the problem.  Ask Sue not to insult Ben anymore.  If<br/>\nshe does, keep her away from Ben.  Compliment Ben so he feels better.<br/>\n<br/>\n*General form: Sue caused Ben distress.*<br/>\n<br/>\nSolve *that* problem, and Ben won&#39;t want to hit Sue anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMany what if questions, prima facie, seem impossible to solve without<br/>\ncoercion.  *Oh my God, Ben is hitting Sue, I better grab him and lock him<br/>\nin his room!*  might be a typical response.  And, if the only information<br/>\navailable is &quot;Ben is hitting Sue,&quot; then I think the problem may not be<br/>\nsoluble.  However, a little more information, in the form of an explanation<br/>\nof the [objectionable behavior X] will render the question near trivial.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Elliot</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36329,"nextTopicId":36376}}
