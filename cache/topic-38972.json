When<br/>\n&gt; Constantine declared Christianity the official religion they needed to<br/>\n&gt; define it.  So the Nicene creed appeared and at this time the Trinity was<br/>\n&gt; &quot;established&quot;, for lack of a better word.

But certainly there was a time when Jesus and the Holy Spirit were<br/>\nnot so closely linked with God as they have been in the Trinity.  The<br/>\nUnitarians can reasonably claim that earlier time as their roots, and that<br/>\nwould make sense.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that virtually all Christian churches<br/>\ntoday accept the Trinity, and consider those who do not (like the<br/>\nUnitarians) &quot;not Christian&quot;.  That isn&#39;t intended as a personal opinion, but<br/>\njust an observation of how it is.  Unitarians are not constrained to accept<br/>\nother churches&#39; opinions of them, of course.  The Mormons don&#39;t....they<br/>\ncontinue to consider themselves Christian, even though other churches don&#39;t<br/>\nthink they are.  That&#39;s their perogative.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in the end, if you decide the UU church is the right place for you, what<br/>\ndoes it matter what other churches think it is, anyhow!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38971,"nextTopicId":38902}}
