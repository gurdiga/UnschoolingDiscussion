My oldest is very busy now<br/>\nwith gym, piano and a part time job so is not at home that much. The two<br/>\nyounger ones get along very well, lots of creative time together, shared art<br/>\nprojects, play, etc.  It seems the oldest one usually starts a project and<br/>\nthen the younger joins in to the best of her ability. We read together<br/>\nallot. I read out-loud for an hour or two everyday to both of the girls.<br/>\nNot sure what you are wanting to know exactly.. feel free to ask again..
