There&#39;s also <br/>\ninfo there on getting the word out. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/mhfurgason/hug/starting.html\">http://www.geocities.com/mhfurgason/hug/starting.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI really enjoyed doing HUG.  It got to be too big (almost 200 <br/>\nfamilies) and diluted (everyone who wasn&#39;t a Christian homeschooler <br/>\nended up there by default) so it&#39;s basically inactive now.  There&#39;s <br/>\nonly the web site left.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow there are few of us radical unschoolers who call ourselves The <br/>\nHUG Underground just for fun.  They&#39;re all families I met while <br/>\ncoordinating HUG and we became friends.  Those families are the <br/>\ngreatest benefit of doing the group for so long.  Their friendship is <br/>\nworth all of the frustrations.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, kbcdlovejo@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 9/7/2003 3:10:45 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n&gt; felesina@c... writes:<br/>\n&gt; Sacramento Unschooling Network<br/>\n&gt; www.SUNetwork.com<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And was wondering if those who have experience with this sort of <br/>\nthing could<br/>\n&gt; offer some feedback.<br/>\n&gt; What I learned: You&#39;ll meet a lot more unschoolers if you host a <br/>\nconference! <br/>\n&gt; &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think just the sharing of unschooling is worth the expense and <br/>\npain of <br/>\n&gt; having a group.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You are welcome to hit our site (which is unfortunately down at the <br/>\n&gt; moment)----and I&#39;d be happy to answer any specific questions you <br/>\nmight have about our <br/>\n&gt; group and what we do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Kelly<br/>\n&gt; SchoolsOutSupport.org<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Unschooling support group","postDate":"1063210262","msgId":80177,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlNy5mYWM0NmIwLjJjOTBhNzE2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":80018,"nextInTopic":80195,"prevInTime":80176,"nextInTime":80178,"topicId":80018,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/7/2003 3:10:45 PM Eastern Daylight Time, felesina@cwnet.com writes: Sacramento Unschooling Network www.SUNetwork.com And was wondering if","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-822525200\">In a message dated 9/7/2003 3:10:45 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:felesina@...\">felesina@...</a> writes:<br/>\nSacramento Unschooling Network<br/>\nwww.SUNetwork.com<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd was wondering if those who have experience with this sort of thing could<br/>\noffer some feedback.<br/>\nWhat I learned: You&#39;ll meet a lot more unschoolers if you host a conference! <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think just the sharing of unschooling is worth the expense and pain of <br/>\nhaving a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are welcome to hit our site (which is unfortunately down at the <br/>\nmoment)----and I&#39;d be happy to answer any specific questions you might have about our <br/>\ngroup and what we do.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\nSchoolsOutSupport.org<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":53685616,"authorName":"Bronwen","from":"&quot;Bronwen&quot; &lt;felesina@...&gt;","profile":"bronwen67","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Unschooling support group","postDate":"1062960241","msgId":80018,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmUwMWMzNzU3MCQxM2M4ODA4MCQyYTg4NTE0MkBmZWxlc2luYT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwNjI3OTg4NzguNTA3LjgzNDUwLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":80177,"prevInTime":80017,"nextInTime":80019,"topicId":80018,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi!
