It  really <br/>\nsours a list so I stopped until someone else began recommending  tutors for 7 year <br/>\nolds....<br/>\n<br/>\nThe email was a FWD from a friend who is on their list mixed with  some <br/>\nevents this past week.

I did put an FYI out there to let  them know that <br/>\ncyberhopping is illegal but....I doubt they care.
