Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m overwhelmed by what Gatto<br/>\nwrites about, people as &quot;products&quot; of schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI subscribe to a book excerpt website and here&#39;s an excerpt from a<br/>\npoet and critic of the time, which I thought interesting for<br/>\nunschoolers who read Gatto.  The work that is Aristotle&#39;s life has<br/>\ndefinitely been used extensively by school systems, and according to<br/>\nGatto, not for purposes of making intelligence grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Delanceyplace.com:<br/>\n    In today&#39;s excerpt, T.S. Eliot comments on Aristotle.  Eliot, one<br/>\nof the towering poets and literary critics of the 20th century, is<br/>\ndiscussing the nature of Aristotle&#39;s genius in his article &#39;The<br/>\nPerfect Critic&#39;.  The importance of the statement here is his <br/>\nassertion that great analysis is not the outcome of some repeatable<br/>\nprocess or method, but instead comes from intelligence alone:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot;Aristotle is a person who has suffered from the adherence of<br/>\npersons who must be regarded less as his disciples than as his<br/>\nsectaries.  One must be firmly distrustful of accepting Aristotle in a<br/>\ncanonical spirit; this is to lose the whole living force of him.   He<br/>\nwas primarily a man of not only remarkable but universal intelligence...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    ...in his short and broken treatise he provides an eternal<br/>\nexample-- not of laws, or even of method, for there is no method<br/>\nexcept to be very intelligent, but of intelligence itself swiftly<br/>\noperating the analysis of sensation to the point of principle and<br/>\ndefinition.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nT.S.
