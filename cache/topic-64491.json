It runs hot and cold, but I&#39;d suggest that no one mention how &quot;slow&quot; <br/>\nthe list might be one day---that tends to send it into a whirlwind of <br/>\nactivity! In the &quot;be-careful-what-you-ask-for way! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nContentious? Umm...Yes and No.  &lt;g&gt; Certain things&#39;ll get it going more than <br/>\nothers! Spanking&#39;ll draw it out pretty fast! Chores. Christianity---almost <br/>\nalways! &lt;g&gt; Arguing for the sake of arguing---that&#39;ll do it! <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a wonderful place if you want to learn about unschooling and peaceful <br/>\nparenting---there&#39;s no better (the message boards are good too! and has a few <br/>\nother voices that don&#39;t show here!)!  Sometimes it&#39;s best to just sit back <br/>\nand read.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome! <br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64477,"nextTopicId":64492}}
