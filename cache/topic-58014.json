They can quote the episodes, they analyze the changes in characters <br/>\nover the years, they discuss what lines they think might have been out of <br/>\ncharacter or episodes they thought fell short of their potential.  So for <br/>\nthem, they way THEY watch it, it&#39;s a good source of lots of information about <br/>\ninterpersonals.  And it makes them all glad they&#39;re not in school!  Some of <br/>\nthem have been in, and they tell Holly which parts of the school aspects they <br/>\nthink are realistic.   They mine the heck out of Arthur.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a while here when the PBS kids&#39; schedule changed it was only going to be <br/>\non at 6:30 a.m. and none of them wanted to get up for it.  But someone at <br/>\nKNME figured out this plan was bad, and so it&#39;s repeated at 4:30 or 4:00 in <br/>\nthe afternoon and now they&#39;re all happy again.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57967,"nextTopicId":58036}}
