My boys are quite used to differing opinions when it comes to a lot of things, because my parents and I have very different opinions about almost everything. I&#39;m quite sure that they will be able to understand that some words (a lot of words, actually) are used differently by different people. Falls into the same catagory as people believe different things about God, about what homeschooling is, about what a promise means, etc. The dictionary definition of lazy is not negative in the least. They know that definition, and they will also learn that some people use the word in other ways.

It isn&#39;t a valid argument to say, &quot;This<br/>\nis my family and you just don&#39;t understand what goes on in our loving<br/>\natmosphere,&quot; because children have certain developmental abilities and<br/>\nstrengths at certain ages and every mother knows that it is a easy cop out to<br/>\nuse our children to justify our own actions. Using a five year old, or any<br/>\nyoung child for that matter, as a justification for an adult action isn&#39;t<br/>\ngoing to gain anyone any respect here because it is such a basic thing to<br/>\nunderstand just how powerful we are in our children&#39;s lives. Understanding<br/>\nwhere we let off and where the child begins is really the first step in acting<br/>\nresponsibly and maturely towards our own children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10294444,"authorName":"Myranda","from":"&quot;Myranda&quot; &lt;myrandab@...&gt;","profile":"randascloudream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: &quot;Words will never hurt me&quot; & unschooling","postDate":"1034349224","msgId":46149,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxZmMwMWMyNzEzOCRkNWQ0ZGU0MCQwMTNmZmVhOUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGI5LjI4NDM0YWU0LjJhZDgzMWE2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46153,"prevInTime":46148,"nextInTime":46150,"topicId":46149,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I knew I would homeschool my children without a structured curriculum by the time I was 15.

From the time my oldest was about 9 mths old, I started teaching him colors and shapes by using the words all the time (here&#39;s your red ball, num num&#39;s are circles today, etc). Same with counting by the time he was 18 mths (here&#39;s two cookies, you have three blocks, here&#39;s another one, now you have four blocks). We started park days when he was 6 mths old, trips to libraries, zoos, and other attractions by one year. I know I found out a lot more information about unschooling when I first ran across the term when he was 3 years old, but I don&#39;t think that I wasn&#39;t doing it before just because I didn&#39;t know the name for it. Even if I didn&#39;t &quot;start unschooling&quot; til then, we&#39;ve been doing it for over four years now, so I wouldn&#39;t exactly say I&#39;ve just been lately figuring it out either. Honestly, I don&#39;t like the term unschooling at all - it seems negative, like un-doing something, when that is not the case at all. I much prefer child-led learning, and THAT I have definitely been doing since birth. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand what you mean about listening to others who are more knowledgeable about medicine, musical instruments, etc. But those things to not have individual personalities. Children do. Some generalizations are fine, such as all children need to eat several times a day, all children need love, etc. But when you&#39;re talking about feelings and thoughts, those vary from child to child and no one can say &quot;all children feel ____ when ____ happens&quot; or &quot;all children think ____ is bad&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, there is a lack of clarity between &quot;we call him&quot; and &quot;he made it up&quot;, for the simple reason that I do not share personal details very often and do tend to keep them to myself out of habit. Both statements are true, but the second just goes deeper into the subject, saying where the nicknames started. I could send you a huge, long, e-mail explaining exactly when and where our nicknames started, all the nicknames my family uses, what each person likes about them, the ones each person decided they didn&#39;t like, etc, but there&#39;s no need to do that. Without the whole story, though, some things will seem &quot;not quite right&quot; because you can&#39;t see how they fit, not because they don&#39;t fit. Hmm, now I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m making sense. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  Everybody I know has things they would go back and change if they could.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Saying you&#39;ve been unschooling since they were born, though,  isn&#39;t true if <br/>\n  you&#39;re just lately figuring out what unschooling is and how it works.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t claim unschooling or homeschooling before the time Kirby would have <br/>\n  gone to school.  Some people do, for some reasons which are sometimes good.  <br/>\n  But retroactively saying you&#39;ve unschooled since you had children isn&#39;t as <br/>\n  honest as it could be.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s hard to really look at what we&#39;re doing unless we can SEE what we&#39;re <br/>\n  doing, and getting a story clear in our own heads is a good way to look at <br/>\n  it.  If someone tells people &quot;We call him this because...&quot; and the next day <br/>\n  it&#39;s &quot;He made up his own nickname&quot; then there is a lack of clarity which goes <br/>\n  deeper than any one conversation, or weeklong discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n  On the other hand, maybe long dicussions are the equivalent of people <br/>\n  berating me because I don&#39;t play soccer or swim.  No amount of discussion is <br/>\n  going to change that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Howard Gardner&#39;s description of intrapersonal intelligence (people can google <br/>\n  it if that&#39;s unfamiliary) in his set of multiple intelligences describes <br/>\n  something just as real as dancing or understanding math.  BUt not everyone is <br/>\n  equally interested or facile with it.  I&#39;m not a dancer.  I&#39;m no jock.  Some <br/>\n  parts of math confuse the heck out of me.  Interpersonal/intrapersonal and <br/>\n  verbal stuff, though, come easy to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Trying to get someone to understand or believe that some people can perceive <br/>\n  interpersonal situations better than others seems to be an insult in this <br/>\n  culture.  Sometimes we take &quot;all men are created equal&quot; to mean all have the <br/>\n  same abilities and talents.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  If someone here were advising me or my kids on sports medicine, I would <br/>\n  really listen, because I don&#39;t know.  If someone advised me about how to seal <br/>\n  up a shower or fix plumbing, I would really listen.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But when interpersonal or intrapersonal skills are the question, all emotion <br/>\n  breaks loose and those who have less of it deny &quot;more of it&quot; could exist.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not clearly expressing myself, and I do know it&#39;s awkward <br/>\n  subject matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can tell when a note doesn&#39;t match another note.  Some people can&#39;t.  So I <br/>\n  should tune the guitar, not the other person.  If I say &quot;I&#39;m no better at <br/>\n  tuning this guitar,&quot; or &quot;You know your own guitar best,&quot; that&#39;s not being <br/>\n  honest or helpful.  If I said &quot;I  have a guitar and it bothers me that the <br/>\n  chords don&#39;t sound right,&quot; I could advise on tuning it even by e-mail.   If <br/>\n  that person then said &quot;I tuned it that way on purpose&quot; or &quot;It sounds fine to <br/>\n  me,&quot; I would wonder what the original post had been about.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
