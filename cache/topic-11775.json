The problem I am facing is that I can only send email <br/>\nfrom the net and I receive my email through an email program on my <br/>\ncomp. So when I reply to a post it doesn&#39;t get sent. It just sits <br/>\nthere on my comp using up space. I have been looking for a service in <br/>\nwhich I can send email through my email program but can&#39;t seem to be <br/>\nable to find one that gives the stmp info. so that I can do this. <br/>\nDoes anyone have any suggestions as to where to turn for this type of <br/>\nfree email service?   Corallyn  P.S. This is why I have been so quiet <br/>\nlately.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11769,"nextTopicId":11784}}
