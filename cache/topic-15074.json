Will they always tell you? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can see in their eyes when something is really exciting, or see the <br/>\nexcited agitation in their posture and voice if they&#39;re at the museum or in <br/>\nthe library or online and they see something that really lights them up.  Or <br/>\nthe&#39;ll ask questions, like about the space station or whatever.    If you see <br/>\na class offered, you could mention it.  Maybe you could offer to take the <br/>\nclass with your child.  Or rent a video about that subject next time you&#39;re <br/>\nat the video store. If you make the suspected interest accessible, you can <br/>\nwatch and see whether they&#39;re still interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was helping raise a child long ago, my first husband&#39;s 10-13 year old <br/>\nbrother.  He had a huge fascination with all flight--planes, helicopters, <br/>\nspacecraft.  We used to get him books, and take him places.  Then after a <br/>\nwhile he was done, and went on to other things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be a huge Beatles fan, and I still know some trivia others find <br/>\nuseful, and I have my albums and listen to them sometimes (I was on a binge a <br/>\ncouple of weeks ago--Something New, Beatles 65, Yesterday and Today...).  But <br/>\nnow if a book comes out or a TV special or a new Beatles recording, I don&#39;t <br/>\nreally care.  I&#39;ve moved on to other things.  It&#39;s important to let our kids <br/>\ndo that too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNeither &quot;shower them with it and send them to special summer camps&quot; nor &quot;just <br/>\nignore them and if they want it they&#39;ll beg&quot; is the right answer.  The right <br/>\nanswers are always toward the balance point, in my experience.
