My oldest I really don&#39;t remember <br/>\nthat much because being an only then it was so much easier for me to manage. <br/>\nOne thing that really opened up my eyes as to how people are though. My <br/>\noldest was about 2 and in a stroller. My mom and I were in a mall shopping. <br/>\nI noticed a man in one of the stores we were in. I noticed him again in <br/>\nanother store. I watched and noticed he was following us. I told my mom to <br/>\nwatch her purse. I finally stared him down in one store and let him know I <br/>\nwas aware of him. He left. It wasn&#39;t until I got home and told my then <br/>\nhusband and he remarked that maybe it wasn&#39;t the purses he was after, it was <br/>\nour daughter. Scary.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the next two, being they were only 13 months apart, I can&#39;t say I went <br/>\nvery many places alone. I had a double stroller and made sure they stayed in <br/>\nit. I do remember though by the time they were 4 them understanding. My son <br/>\nduring one of his T ball games lost us. We were all marching to the field <br/>\nand he got distracted. He stopped and by the time he came around, we were <br/>\ngone. My husband and I were coach and team mom so we had a bunch of little <br/>\naqua shirts to watch. My oldest realized Joseph was gone. I ran back <br/>\nretracing our steps and found him right by the fence. He was a little scared <br/>\nbut not crying or anything. He had stayed right where he was left like I <br/>\ntold him. He told me some people tried to talk to him and he said he was <br/>\ntold to stay right where he was. He didn&#39;t leave with anyone and just <br/>\nwaited. He was 4 then.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a 6 and 7 year old now plus the 2 year old, I make sure they all get <br/>\nit. My 2 year old now, at 2 months past 2 years understands enough so she <br/>\nwill not leave my sight. If she wants to go to another aisle, she clls me <br/>\nand waits. She knows we all go down the aisles together unless I have my <br/>\nmom, oldest or husband with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 3 months FREE*. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail&xAPID=42&PS=47575&PI=7324&DI=7474&SU=\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail&xAPID=42&PS=47575&PI=7324&DI=7474&SU=</a> <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/getmsg&HL=1216hotmailtaglines_advancedjmf_3mf\">http://www.hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/getmsg&HL=1216hotmailtaglines_advancedjmf_3mf</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"3 yo running away in crowds","postDate":"1040571724","msgId":52702,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVhLjMzMDIxYjY2LjJiMzczNzRjQGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":52712,"prevInTime":52701,"nextInTime":52703,"topicId":52702,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/22/02 6:30:02 AM Central Standard Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes:  Some of this is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-317578636\">In a message dated 12/22/02 6:30:02 AM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  At what age do <br/>\n kids get it? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of this is personality. Jared still worries me at 9, even though I know <br/>\nhe can shop on his own and won&#39;t leave with anyone, he still doesn&#39;t really <br/>\npay attention to where you are. At least now he tries to say something if <br/>\nhe&#39;s going somewhere else.....at younger ages he would see something cool and <br/>\njust be gone in a split second. <br/>\nHe&#39;s very easily distracted and has a hard time remembering to communicate <br/>\nwhere he&#39;s going. Definitely would have been labeled in school due to lack of <br/>\nfocus.<br/>\nHe&#39;s a dreamer, an artist, the quiet, sweet personality that lives in a dream <br/>\nworld. It&#39;s really neat except when you&#39;re trying to go somwhere with him!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI shop with my 23 mo. old out of the cart. He pretty much stays with us, <br/>\nstopping to touch and look at things here and there, we try to go in his <br/>\ndirection and at his pace which makes shopping fun. Once in a while I have to <br/>\ngo pick him up and bring him back, but mostly he wanders around and through <br/>\nus as we go about our shopping.<br/>\nSo part of it is age, and part of it is personality I think. So who knows <br/>\nwhen yours will be more capable of this.....I think trying to see the things <br/>\nthey want to and going at their pace helps a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;Knowledge will not always take the place of simple observation.&quot;<br/>\n                                                        ~Arnold Lobel<br/>\nUnschooling support at pensacolaunschoolers.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52246,"nextTopicId":52727}}
