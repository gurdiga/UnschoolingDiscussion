The boys, also, started asking me what things were really early, be a year-15 mths, and I&#39;d always answer them. Some days, I feel like that&#39;s all we did, was to walk around identifying things!! Since they went to work with me often, and I worked in various stores as a merchandiser, there was a LOT of things for them to ask about! LOL<br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not so sure I see it the same way. Babies don&#39;t necessarily learn by <br/>\n  example. Or I should say not always and we&#39;re talking little babies here. If <br/>\n  a baby was in a house where no one could walk and they all used wheelchairs, <br/>\n  the baby would still try to walk. I&#39;m not so sure that babies really learn a <br/>\n  lot of things. Babies learn what they need as far as comforting and and so <br/>\n  on but learning colors and shapes? I never made it a point to say all colors <br/>\n  and shapes to my babies when I was playing with them. Sometimes when I read <br/>\n  a book but not literally teaching them. When they were old enough, they <br/>\n  would ask &quot;that?&quot; and then I would tell them. That&#39;s child led. I don&#39;t see <br/>\n  teaching babies gives them any kind of upper hand later on in life and I <br/>\n  don&#39;t see it as necessarily a part of play and life at such a young age.
