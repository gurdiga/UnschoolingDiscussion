My dad just really has this thing about how school <br/>\ntaught him discipline. He is a very disciplined guy (retired air force reserves)<br/>\nand was a perpetual student...worked his way through his electrical engineering  <br/>\ndegree, went back and got his industrial engineering masters, almost got his PhD<br/>\n(finished the class work, but not the dissertation). Later got his CPA. He has told<br/>\nme that he can see how smart Jason is and has no doubt that he will learn things<br/>\neasily that interest him. But he is concerned because he sees that there are certain<br/>\nthings (like writing and math drills) that are not &quot;fun&quot; but are necessary. I tried <br/>\nto explain that if they are necessary then Jason will see a need to learn them when<br/>\nhe needs them. He just does not see it and it bothers him that I do not &quot;make&quot; Jason<br/>\ndo things (not just school work...he thinks that I let him &quot;get away&quot; with a lot of things).<br/>\n<br/>\nI just realized the other day that part of the problem is that my dad has no idea what I am<br/>\ndoing as far as &quot;school&quot;. He asked Jason what he was studying, places he had gone etc <br/>\nand Jason did not understand what he wanted to know (since we do not &quot;do&quot; school). I have<br/>\ndecided to send a monthly (or so) email to both my parents and my ILs (who are very accepting of<br/>\nwhat we are doing so far) detailing all the great things that Jason has been learning and<br/>\ndoing (books we are reading, his current interests, some of the experiments he loves to do etc). <br/>\nI figure that it should not be too hard as it is just *so* cool all the neat stuff he is into.<br/>\nAnd it will probably put my dad&#39;s fears to rest. He asks me what we are doing when we talk, but<br/>\noften I can&#39;t think of any specific thing off the top of my head (mainly because we are just<br/>\nliving life, not doing school!).<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112038769,"authorName":"Shyrley","from":"Shyrley &lt;shyrley.williams@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] riding bikes","postDate":"1046793003","msgId":60012,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFNjRDQjJCLkY2MjlDREVFQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDEwMWMyZTI2MiQ3ZDdiZTg2MCQ2OTAwYThjMEBsZWlnaD4="},"prevInTopic":60011,"nextInTopic":60106,"prevInTime":60011,"nextInTime":60013,"topicId":59911,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I have realized lately that his <br/>\nlearning style is watching others. When he gets a new computer game, he wants me<br/>\nto play it first (or at least do the hard parts). He tends to wait until he is<br/>\ngood and ready to do something, then does it overnight. I have to keep reminding <br/>\nmyself of this sometimes. He hasn&#39;t let me down yet!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is one of the reasons that I told my dad that I would not make him &quot;practice&quot;<br/>\nwriting (my dad thinks that he should practice writing everyday). Jason hates writing.<br/>\nHe has no reason or desire to write at this point and I know that when he does he <br/>\nwill be able to. The funny thing is that my dad was equating writing with communicating<br/>\nand kept saying that Jason needed to be able to communicate well. Jason has no problem in<br/>\ncommunicating (he speaks very well and has a great vocabulary, an amazing memory and  a<br/>\ncanny way of using the appropriate word). I brought up how most folks (especially in the <br/>\nbusiness world) use the computer and then reminded my dad that he has the world&#39;s worst<br/>\nhandwriting and that it has never held him back LOL! My dad&#39;s biggest point was that he<br/>\nneeded to be taught the discipline of working at something and improving at it. I tried<br/>\nto counter that he is learning this already naturally (mostly through his computer games)<br/>\nand that it was not something that I needed to teach.

He swears that he learns by watching and thinking, even <br/>\n&gt; physical <br/>\n&gt; things. I believe him!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow! This sounds so much like Jason, my 6 yo. I have realized lately that his <br/>\nlearning style is watching others. When he gets a new computer game, he wants me<br/>\nto play it first (or at least do the hard parts). He tends to wait until he is<br/>\ngood and ready to do something, then does it overnight. I have to keep reminding <br/>\nmyself of this sometimes. He hasn&#39;t let me down yet!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is one of the reasons that I told my dad that I would not make him &quot;practice&quot;<br/>\nwriting (my dad thinks that he should practice writing everyday). Jason hates writing.<br/>\nHe has no reason or desire to write at this point and I know that when he does he <br/>\nwill be able to. The funny thing is that my dad was equating writing with communicating<br/>\nand kept saying that Jason needed to be able to communicate well. Jason has no problem in<br/>\ncommunicating (he speaks very well and has a great vocabulary, an amazing memory and  a<br/>\ncanny way of using the appropriate word). I brought up how most folks (especially in the <br/>\nbusiness world) use the computer and then reminded my dad that he has the world&#39;s worst<br/>\nhandwriting and that it has never held him back LOL! My dad&#39;s biggest point was that he<br/>\nneeded to be taught the discipline of working at something and improving at it. I tried<br/>\nto counter that he is learning this already naturally (mostly through his computer games)<br/>\nand that it was not something that I needed to teach. Not sure he got the point though. ;o)<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Teach your baby to read","postDate":"1046722573","msgId":59989,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxOGYwMWMyZTFjMSRlZWIwZDgyMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDNFNjBDOTI4LjFFNzMxNkREQGNhcGl0YWwubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":59988,"nextInTopic":59992,"prevInTime":59988,"nextInTime":59990,"topicId":59911,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If this were true snip the idea of there being this window in which kids can really learn reading very early with out much teaching (just showing them","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-357140458\">If this were true<br/>\nsnip&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;the idea of there being this window in which kids can<br/>\nreally learn reading very early with out much &quot;teaching&quot; (just showing<br/>\nthem the words and saying what it is&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nthen the majority of young children in America would be reading on their<br/>\nown.

What might be okay for one baby might be damaging <br/>\n(neurologically) to another. It is thought that the massive increase in <br/>\nreading disabilities among American schoolchildren might be a direct <br/>\nresult of pushing down the reading curriculum into early grades, <br/>\nkindergarten, and preschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are clearly some advantages to later reading - after years of <br/>\nclose observation it is very obvious to me that kids who began reading <br/>\nfor themselves a bit later than other kids have superior listening <br/>\nskills and a better sense of the many other ways to take in information.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that for some people the baby early-reading stuff gives them a <br/>\nway to interact with their babies  (flashcards, etc.) - and that they <br/>\njust kind of feel the need for something structured for some reason. <br/>\nBut tying that to reading instruction is a bad idea, imo, because one <br/>\nthing we do know is that we adults can REALLY mess up a child&#39;s natural <br/>\ndesire and ability to read.

The kid tried to learn, the <br/>\nparents tried to teach, then there was a period of velcro, and without the <br/>\nparents knowing, the child learned to tie her next pair of laced shoes.

I followed some of the early<br/>\nreading posts and it sounds like this is more or less how some of the<br/>\nvery early readers did it (the grandfather with the 2nd grade education<br/>\nwriting the words in his stories for the child to see).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the earlier posts in relation to my latest anxiety about my<br/>\n10yo still not reading.
