Should be<br/>\n&quot;reasonable&quot; force.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, on to the balance.  You have made a statement as fact which is your<br/>\nopinion.  The facts are that &quot;justice&quot; in the U.S. is, indeed, all luck of<br/>\nthe draw as it is all dependent on who gets killed, who does the killing,<br/>\nwho has the money, who doesn&#39;t have the money, who know who and the<br/>\npersonalities of the respective law enforcement officers.  Anyone who claims<br/>\notherwise is not familiar with the realities of the law and what is<br/>\nhappening on a daily basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, a group of FBI agents framed an individual who did 35 years for<br/>\nthis crime that he didn&#39;t commit.  The agents were given a warning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example, a cop in LA framed more than a dozen men for crimes ranging<br/>\nfrom burglary to homicide.  One of those he framed got the death penalty.<br/>\nWhen his &quot;game&quot; was discovered, he was tried and got 5 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf &quot;you are right&quot; has nothing to do with it, the courts do not always have<br/>\nanything to do with it as most cases never get to the courts.  Also, an<br/>\ninvestigation can consist of nothing more than an interview after which the<br/>\ncop involved writes a report recommending no further action.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several crime computers, one of which is local, one of which is<br/>\nstatewide and one of which is nationwide.  Any stats on murders go to the<br/>\nFBI and go into the national crime computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, February 11, 2001 8:49 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re.
