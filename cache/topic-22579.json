(seriously I thought I might have to get the puter checked) As a <br/>\nlover of books, book stores and libraries, I am so jealous of those of you <br/>\nthat have a choice of libraries in your towns! We just have the one <br/>\ncity/county library and some outreach half buses, half RVs that carry books <br/>\ntoo local small towns and communities called Bookmobiles.  I went over to <br/>\nHobby Lobby and picked up some fairly large canvas bags (unbleached about <br/>\n20&quot;x30&quot; i guess) and brought them home, painted them all up with fabric <br/>\npaints. I put my kids library cards in them and their books. We take them to <br/>\nthe library with us, and the books are supposedly to go back in the bags as <br/>\nsoon as the child is done reading. This works as long as i am the one to find <br/>\nand pick up the books! For me, I carry a nice sized hemp basket but am <br/>\nlooking for something a bit more oblong... (another excuse for me to visit <br/>\nHobby Lobby! Oh and while I am here I think I will just pick up some more <br/>\nscrapbooking supplies, and look at these brushes, I do so need some new paint <br/>\nbrushes, OHOHOH!!! and lookie! fabric is on sale!....) ~Nancy who has lost <br/>\nher mind at the thought of going to the local craft store! :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22539,"nextTopicId":22517}}
