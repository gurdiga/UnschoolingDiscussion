He needs some routine and structure, but not the sit at<br/>\nhis desk and do worksheets all day. I do want some though. I would<br/>\nlike to work moree in areas he enjoys to keep his interest. If any<br/>\none has any favorite sites you would like to share I would sure<br/>\nappreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I have been told by a friend, (cps worker) that I should count<br/>\non being turned in since he is special needs. She said she would<br/>\nbe the one sent and just keep good records. My question is has any<br/>\none been turned into CPS for homeschooling? and what kind of records<br/>\nshould I keep. There are no specifics here that I have been told<br/>\nor read, just have to have 180 days of school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Lynda&quot; Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> To: Subject: Re: <br/>\n&gt;[Unschooling-dotcom]Update, 6 Kids in Idaho Date: Tue, 5 Jun 2001 08:00:26 <br/>\n&gt;-0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Here&#39;s the latest from mom. Many times on this list I have seen folks <br/>\n&gt;absolutely livid over CPS coming into homeschooling homes and trying to <br/>\n&gt;remove children. I have seen folks on this list make almost identical <br/>\n&gt;statements to those made by this mom.

Dennis&quot; &gt; &gt; bandaid, from walking in <br/>\n&gt;a &gt; &gt; public place minding our own business, I&#39;d consider it fairly severe. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, there has been no indication that this reported injury <br/>\n&gt;occurred on &gt; public property. The only reference to location is that of a <br/>\n&gt;person &quot;walking &gt; near the house&quot;. A house located on 40 acres and with <br/>\n&gt;signs warning folks to &gt; stay away. For all we know, dogs chased and bit <br/>\n&gt;someone who was either &gt; accidentally trespassing while on a nature walk or <br/>\n&gt;was intent on checking out &gt; this prime property. Or perhaps refused to <br/>\n&gt;continue on their way down a &gt; public road when dogs displayed protective <br/>\n&gt;behavior while on private adjacent &gt; property. &gt; &gt; Are y ou saying that if <br/>\n&gt;while bicycling a paved road, you or your child hit a &gt; pebble and take a <br/>\n&gt;tumble, you would be upset because you would consider the &gt; ensuing broken <br/>\n&gt;arm or cut on knee requiring either a butterfly bandage or 3 &gt; stitches to <br/>\n&gt;be &quot;severe&quot;? &gt; &gt; My use of &quot;carried away&quot; refers to defining and usage of <br/>\n&gt;the word &quot;severe&quot; , &gt; not to the emotional action one might feel for ANY <br/>\n&gt;&quot;boo-boo&quot; suffered by &gt; one&#39;s babies---whether occurring on public or <br/>\n&gt;private property. &gt; &gt; Vicki &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a <br/>\n&gt;free newsletter and more! &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives: &gt; <br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a> &gt; &gt; Another great list <br/>\n&gt;sponsored by Home Education Magazine! &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a> &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
