None of the medical people <br/>\nthat I know were home tonight when I sent the post and hadn&#39;t been <br/>\nhome for a while. It has been really bugging me since DH insists that <br/>\nI got this from the fan being on at night. Which, by the way, we <br/>\nsleep with year round being in such a hot, humid climate here in <br/>\nHouston. Seems to me that if it were caused by the fan then we would <br/>\nboth be sick year round as well. The other thing about it is that <br/>\nonly 1yos DH and me have this. 3.5yod and 5.5yos do not and I snuggle <br/>\nwith them every night. I did finally get a hold of my sister and my <br/>\nmil they both said the same thing, that you can&#39;t get sick from <br/>\nsleeping with the fan on or solely from getting cold (Sorry, <br/>\nearthmoon. Neither of these theories make sense to me. Maybe it is my <br/>\nmedical upbringing, mom&#39;s an R.N., dad&#39;s a Chiropractor, and bil is <br/>\nM.D. I would be interested in hearing your theory behind it though.) <br/>\nI can see how the cold would make you more suseptable to a cold, but <br/>\nthe virus or the bacteria have to be presant in order to actually get <br/>\nsick from being cold.

An allergy is an irritation that can do anything<br/>\nfrom effect something topically to irritate the immune system.  You canNOT<br/>\ncatch an allergy!  However, someone who has never be allergic before can<br/>\ndevelop allergies later in life from a variety of reasons and causes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere you sleep or how you sleep can effect whether or not you become prone<br/>\nto colds.  IE.  You use the fan, your throat and sinus cavities become<br/>\nirritated and are thus more suseptible to invading cold viruses.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you can&#39;t get a cold from being cold but again you are more suseptible<br/>\nand therefore are more likely to get a cold.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally speaking mild symptoms of colds and allergies are basically the<br/>\nsame which is why it usually takes a professional to determine which is<br/>\nwhich at first.  However, colds go away after running a routine coarse. <br/>\nAllergies, depending on the type, don&#39;t go away until the cause goes<br/>\naway--pollen born allergies are usually only seen from spring through the<br/>\nend of autumn.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther allergies go away from you remove the things you are allergic to such<br/>\nas wheat or dairy products.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a bunch of sites on the net along with descriptions of colds from<br/>\nthe simplistic to the detailed medical.
