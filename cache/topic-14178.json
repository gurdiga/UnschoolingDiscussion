These are excellent livelihoods for people who aren&#39;t natural<br/>\nteam players, and who revel in seeing the results of their labor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish more young people would seriously consider learning such a trade<br/>\nrather than following the crowd to the university.  This particularly<br/>\napplies to those (some of whom may be at the top of their class<br/>\nacademically) who aren&#39;t troubled by real or imagined blue collar stigmas,<br/>\nlove to work with their hands, and aren&#39;t afraid to admit they prefer<br/>\nlearning by doing rather than by listening to lectures, reading textbooks,<br/>\ncramming, and taking multiple choice tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile in most cases, you can learn these trades on the job, some people find<br/>\na certificate course at a local low-cost community college a good jumping<br/>\noff point.  Ideally, all those wanting to become self-employed should not<br/>\nonly learn their chosen trade, but also acquire a working knowledge of<br/>\ncomputers, and basic accounting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy top 10 (in no specific order):<br/>\n<br/>\n1.   Plumber:<br/>\nThe need for this will never disappear.  Few tradespeople are more<br/>\nappreciated than an honest plumber who fixes a broken pipe or clogged line.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.   Professional Cleaner:<br/>\nAs long as there are people, there will be dirt.  This is a fact, not a<br/>\ncriticism.  Believe it or not, there are many specialized cleaning services<br/>\nwhich allow contractors to earn $50 or more per hour.  Some of these include<br/>\ncarpet, chimney, sewer, and duct cleaning.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.   House Painter:<br/>\nA good, conscientious house painter is always in demand.   Do excellent work<br/>\nand your customers will do all of your advertising for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.   Arborist:<br/>\nTrees don&#39;t stop growing until they die; dead trees need to be removed,<br/>\ngrowing trees need pruning.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.   Appliance Repair:<br/>\nThis one ranks up there with plumbing.  Be a hero on a daily basis.  Talk<br/>\nabout job satisfaction!<br/>\n<br/>\n6.   HVAC Contractor:<br/>\nThis is a sure bet.  People need to stay warm in the winter and cool in the<br/>\nsummer.<br/>\n<br/>\n7.  Landscape Gardener:<br/>\nLawns always grow.  So do weeds.  A lot of people don&#39;t have the time to<br/>\ntend their gardens.  That&#39;s where you come in.<br/>\n<br/>\n8.   Locksmith:<br/>\nPeople in a hurry tend to lose their keys or lock them in the car more<br/>\noften.  Our society is overflowing with frantically busy people.  Also, with<br/>\nso many people changing their residence each year, there is an ongoing need<br/>\nfor re-keying locks.<br/>\n<br/>\n9.   Barber:<br/>\nHair just keeps on growing.  No advertising necessary if you have enough<br/>\nloyal customers.  Also, it&#39;s a great way to meet and learn from a wide<br/>\nvariety of people.  Over the years, I&#39;ve quite possibly learned more while<br/>\ntalking to people in barbershops than I ever did in a college classroom.<br/>\n<br/>\n10.  Ditch Digger:<br/>\nYou&#39;d be surprised at how many ditches need to be dug.  General contractors<br/>\nsend ditch diggers lots of work.  Government agencies, property owners,<br/>\nsmall businesses--all require ditches from time to time.  A skilled digger<br/>\nwill have more than enough business<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Andersen<br/>\nUncoventional Ideas:  A Collection of Short Essays Which Question Mainstream<br/>\nValues<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unconventionalideas.com\">http://www.unconventionalideas.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14177,"nextTopicId":14179}}
