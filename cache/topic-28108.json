On the fibromyalgia newsgroup, flame wars start all the time <br/>\nbecause someone wants to talk about the possible psychological factors of <br/>\nour illness, and someone else assumes that they mean it&#39;s all in your head.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that there is a psychological factor to all illnesses.  It can be <br/>\nuseful to look at the part that our mind is playing in our illness, even <br/>\nwhen we know that there is a physical cause.  I still remember the morning <br/>\nafter I had learned that my father had died of cancer.  I got the worst <br/>\ncase of the flu I ever had, before or since.  Now I&#39;m quite sure that the <br/>\nflu was caused by a virus.  I&#39;m equally sure that my state of mind had <br/>\nsomething to do with my immune system letting it in.  Recognizing that fact <br/>\nhelped me to relax and accept the nuturing I was needing just then, so I <br/>\ncould get better really fast and deal with what needed to be dealt with.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nTia Leschke   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island<br/>\n**************************************************************************<br/>\nIt is the answers which separate us, the questions which unite us. - Janice <br/>\nLevy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"lite2yu@aol.com","from":"lite2yu@...","profile":"lite2yu2000","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ZoCew-FtTupimbpdylK600lEt5N7xRttj_ASQEvbs3KAv2G-I0dwV2Hi7lIlC5tKmnTTUV1w","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Psychological/Physical","postDate":"1006288718","msgId":28139,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDl0ZWYwZSsxODh2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDl0ZWRtdCszamdmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28135,"nextInTopic":28175,"prevInTime":28138,"nextInTime":28140,"topicId":28108,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"But recognizing that there are some ... that ...
