The organic candies are probably my best option for at home.  At least that will minimize all the junk (preservatives and dyes) she gets when we&#39;re elsewhere.  I need to get DH to eat more at home too.  He likes junk food (processed and pesticide-laden) and eats it a lot.  Though it obviously is his choice to eat that way, he is aware of the yuckiness of his choices.  Dd on the other hand is not quite old enough to understand nutrition and pesticides/preservatives.  I will start meal planning again at night that way dh is less inclined to want to eat out.  This way dh is not so enticed by fast food and a &#39;quick&#39; meal.  It&#39;s hard because I&#39;m vegetarian and DD and Dh are meat eaters, though at home I feed them free-range/organic meats.  I just want to show dd that there are options with healthier foods than the over-processed yucky foods that are so abundant in our society.  I think that the best course of action is to make the organic<br/>\n candy and other foods very available in our home.  Thanks, Jenny for reminding me about the organic candy.  It&#39;s just too bad that it is so expensive;-(  Oh well, in this case I get what I pay for.<br/>\n-Karri<br/>\n<br/>\nJenny Altenbach &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:salten@...\">salten@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Karri,<br/>\nThis has been a hard one for me also.  Not just candy but processed <br/>\nfoods of all kinds.  I very strongly believe that pesticide-laden, <br/>\nadditive-filled foods are not good for our bodies.  The way we deal with <br/>\nit is twofold:  First, we rarely go into stores that have &quot;mainstream&quot; <br/>\ncandy in them--drug stores, regular supermarkets, etc.  This is not to <br/>\navoid candy, it&#39;s just that we rarely go there!  The only things I need <br/>\nto buy at Target or Walgreen&#39;s are toilet paper and socks or underwear.  <br/>\nI get almost all our clothes at thrift stores.  I get our household <br/>\ncleaners at our local co-op or natural foods store.  I buy the kids <br/>\nwhatever candy they want from the co-op, which is all natural without <br/>\ndyes, hydrogenated oils, etc.  At the whole foods place (which we go to <br/>\nless often because I try to support the co-op) I buy all natural <br/>\nchocolates, jelly beans, gummi bears, etc.  Also, there are some great <br/>\nechinacea and vitamin C lollipops there which I give them freely. So, on <br/>\nthe rare occasion when we are in a Walgreen&#39;s I am more comfortable with <br/>\nthem getting candy there because they don&#39;t get the kind with dye and <br/>\ncorn syrup in it that often.  But I don&#39;t buy the giant bags of candy to <br/>\ntake home.  I WILL offer to stop at the co-op for candy to take home if <br/>\nthey really want it.  If we are at a party or at someone else&#39;s home who <br/>\nhas candy or processed foods I don&#39;t restrict them from eating it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe second thing we have just started doing is giving my older child an <br/>\nallowance (he&#39;s 4.5).  He is free to spend it on anything he wishes.  <br/>\nSo, when I am shopping for the family, I buy things according to my <br/>\nvalues and explain that I am happy to buy him all the Sun Drops (all <br/>\nnatural version of M&M&#39;s) he wants but if he wants a giant bag of M&M&#39;s <br/>\n(which I don&#39;t buy for many reasons, not just the dye and additives one) <br/>\nhe can use his allowance.  I try to explain to him why I object to <br/>\nspending my money on certain things, but he is free to make his own <br/>\ndecisions about his money.   I also never judge his decisions and try <br/>\nnot to appear that I am disappointed in them (I&#39;m usually not--after <br/>\nall, what does he know about sweatshops or child slavery?)  Anyway, so <br/>\nfar he&#39;s been fine with the Sun Drops.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I don&#39;t worry about it when they eat the junky stuff <br/>\noccasionally.  Honestly, what has worried me lately is blueberries!  My <br/>\nkids will eat a 3 pound bag of frozen organic blueberries between the <br/>\ntwo of them (4.5 and 18 mo) in 2 days!
