(We&#39;re not together, <br/>\nhaving NOTHING to do with his parenting.) Perry was wonderful with Julian when <br/>\nhe was little. Perry worked as a teacher in a hippy-dippy co-op day care <br/>\ncenter before and after Julian was born. He&#39;s always been great with little ones, <br/>\nand my only criticism of him with little kids is that Perry has very high <br/>\nenergy and tends to overstimulate the crap out of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have a blast.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Julian got older, though, Perry started to get authoritarian and worried <br/>\nand weird. Not all the time, but he&#39;d periodically wory that Julian couldn&#39;t do <br/>\nstructure, or that the homeschooling wasn&#39;t covering enough, or just not <br/>\nlisten to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll need to ask him what made him mellow out. He doesn&#39;t yell very often at <br/>\nhim anymore, and he really seems to be listening to him, and he&#39;s REALLY <br/>\nlightened up on the unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74157,"nextTopicId":74169}}
