Our <br/>\nsummer has been crazy with moving and the kids have spent much more <br/>\ntime than I would have liked watching TV, but than again I was not <br/>\noffering anything better during our days at this time (i.e going to <br/>\nthe park, movies, musuem, etc.).  I had that little worry in the <br/>\nback of my head about them sitting there forever, but lately my son <br/>\nturns the option of TV down when it comes up.  NOt all the time, but <br/>\nhe is does not jump at the chance tro watch which is how he used to <br/>\nact when I offered it.  I guess it took time but he knows he can put <br/>\nit on when he wants and it does get boring after a while.  Right now <br/>\nhis main limitation is he really does not know all the channels so <br/>\nit pretty much stays where it is set (PBS kids or Disney, <br/>\nwhatever).  He likes cartoons and kids shows at 5 and is content <br/>\nwith that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe can also definitly moniter his own fear of shows.  He requests <br/>\nany &quot;scary movies&quot; on DVD (he has already requested Pirates of the <br/>\nCarribean) and he can use the controller to flip past any part that <br/>\nunnverves him.  I was worried about Spiderman because it has some <br/>\npretty graphic things, but he watched all the great stuff with no <br/>\ninterest in the scary parts.  He has an imagination that can go <br/>\ncrazy like both me and dh so that control has been great for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are lucky with the move, we have a play room downstairs and the <br/>\ntv is on in there so it does not drive me crazy.  I like a little <br/>\npeace occasionaly so in the old house I would be inclined to turn it <br/>\noff for sanity&#39;s sake!<br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, ejcrewe@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 9/9/2003 10:03:58 AM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n&gt; holte@s... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just curious, how many of you don&#39;t limit quantity TV watching, <br/>\nbut put <br/>\n&gt; &gt; limits on types of programming?
