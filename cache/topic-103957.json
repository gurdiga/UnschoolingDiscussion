I never turned them on  for kids&#39; <br/>\nbenefit, but for mine.  And with foreign accents or mumbling  actors, subtitles <br/>\nare great!!  <br/>\n <br/>\n(Frustratingly for me, there were no English subtitles on &quot;Flawless&quot; in  <br/>\nwhich Robert deNiro, playing a stroke victim, talks without moving one side of  <br/>\nhis mouth.)<br/>\n <br/>\nSing-along videos--we had lots of them.  Disney, Animaniacs.
