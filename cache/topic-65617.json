The belly button is not the most dangerous place(that would be the tounge) but it is up there. It can take a very long time to heal, and can become infected very easily. It also has a tendancy to push out - the body regects the piercing and will push the jewlery out of the body. One of my best friends is a body piercer and hates belly button peircings, try to talk women out of them all the time. But, if your daughter really wants it and is prepared, yes it will hurt, it will be sore for a long time. She HAS to follow the care instructions to the letter, that area is naturally dirty, it sweats alot, and seems to collect dirt. I say go ahead, I plan on getting mine done, as well as a few others, as soon as I&#39;m done nurcing. I would try to find a place that has licenced piercers. And has been doing body piercers for a long time. A place that has a seperate room for the piercings, ask for pictures of their work. Most places will not pierce people under 18, they may with a parents permision and you may need to sign a release form. One other thing, your daughter with the toung peircing, how soon after she had it done did she remove it? And did she have it done surgically or did she just take it out? If you have any other questions feel free to contact me.

It is really her body and she should be able to decide.<br/>\n2. She&#39;d done her research, even so far as to find the places that do <br/>\n&#39;good, clean work&#39;.<br/>\n3.

When she was<br/>\n16, she still wanted it done. She started to work on her dad and I did too<br/>\nfor her. We got him to reluctantly agree. It&#39;s been over a year and she<br/>\nstill wears various rings. It&#39;s cute and the jewelry she picks is cute also.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to ask as many people as you can where they got piercings done from.<br/>\nThat&#39;s the best way to go, word of mouth.

I was with her and held her hand,<br/>\nwhen the needle went it, she turned as white as a ghost. I thought she would<br/>\nfaint. (she was laying down) But that fast she was fine.

She soaked in<br/>\nepson salts I think once a week, didn&#39;t keep playing with it like some do.<br/>\n(a big no no) and used no alcohol. Way too drying and not necessary. All<br/>\naccording to the guy that did it. She only used antibacterial soap and also<br/>\ntook vitamin E by mouth and used it topically on the piercing every now and<br/>\nthen. Stay out of the sun for awhile and no beach. Hers healed before he<br/>\nsaid it would and she was able to change the piercing after I think 2-3<br/>\nmonths.
