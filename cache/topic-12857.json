But I decided <br/>\nthe problem with that was that some of the work I could get <br/>\nwould be crop-spraying, and that doesn&#39;t go down well with my <br/>\norganic-gardening and farming sensibilities, so I wondered if it <br/>\nwould be feasible to do crop-spraying with organic fertilisers.  <br/>\nYes, I have a strange mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sherry Hagen","from":"Sherry Hagen &lt;oilmagic@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"NN8d_1eHZFtRmFuGSF2t6gvbvZlTeBg6XFZLob2dKqU0khoX7f9MGA3zIRfFIff9XVOpfJr0nctNKFGyD6H5umI9G4zO","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Airplanes","postDate":"968206628","msgId":12857,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5QjVBOTIxLjM1REZBMEMwQHVwLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12932,"prevInTime":12856,"nextInTime":12858,"topicId":12857,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi folks, Today unschooling consisted of going to the airport, seeing a helicopter.
