It started because they wanted to take music, computer, drama,<br/>\nand <br/>\nart courses at the local community college. They can do that without a<br/>\nhigh <br/>\nschool diploma (they&#39;re doing it now) - but it requires a bit of running<br/>\n<br/>\naround getting signatures for permission. They can avoid unit limits and<br/>\n<br/>\nother hassles by having a high school diploma. One easy way to get that,<br/>\nin <br/>\nCalifornia, is to pass the California High School Proficiency Exam<br/>\n(CHSPE). <br/>\nSo - that&#39;s what they&#39;ve decided to do. It also gives them the ability<br/>\nto <br/>\nwork without having to get a work permit - which can ALSO be a hassle<br/>\nsince <br/>\nthey are only given out by schools. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - wanting to take the CHSPE led to them wanting some tutoring in<br/>\nmath. <br/>\nNeither had ever done a single minute of any formal math program - we<br/>\nstarted <br/>\nfrom ground zero with simple arithmetic and moved very quickly through <br/>\nadding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing of whole numbers and then <br/>\nthrough fractions and decimals and percentages and exponents and roots.<br/>\nAlso <br/>\nthrew in some basic geometry and some consumer math - like figuring out <br/>\ncompound interest. Then they were ready for algebra. They could probably<br/>\npass <br/>\nthe test without algebra - they don&#39;t have to score all that high on the<br/>\ntest <br/>\nto pass it - but they wanted to be really prepared so we looked around<br/>\nat <br/>\ndifferent algebra materials and picked one out. They have had no trouble<br/>\n<br/>\nlearning it- at a very very fast pace - probably 10 times faster than in<br/>\na <br/>\ncollege classroom situation. We&#39;ve taken a hiatus for the past couple of<br/>\n<br/>\nmonths because their college classes were taking a lot of their time (my<br/>\n<br/>\ndaughter is taking Beginning Voice, JavaScript programming, and History<br/>\nof <br/>\nOpera). But they did enjoy doing the algebra and plan to get back to it<br/>\nsoon. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that interests me is that they pick up the techniques VERY<br/>\nquickly <br/>\n- they have no math anxiety at all - zero. If they don&#39;t understand <br/>\nsomething, it doesn&#39;t bother them, they just ask questions and try to<br/>\nsee it <br/>\nanother way, etc. Very calm, very natural, very happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey read the material in the book on their own and work some problems.<br/>\nI sit <br/>\nwith them once or twice a week and mostly chat with them about what<br/>\nthey&#39;re <br/>\nworking on - they ask me if there is something they don&#39;t understand.<br/>\nOften <br/>\nwhat they want to talk about is some idea of theirs that goes beyond the<br/>\n<br/>\ntextbook - some idea about how the stuff might be used or something<br/>\nfunny <br/>\nthey noticed, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel SO validated that not doing any formal math was a good idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nBUT - remember - we did a LOT of math in our everyday natural lives. I<br/>\nnotice <br/>\nmath and like it. We play a LOT of games and we do a lot of &quot;math-talk&quot;<br/>\nin <br/>\nour regular lives. For example, I remember eating M&Ms in the front seat<br/>\nof <br/>\nthe car one day, with one kid sitting with me, waiting for something. I<br/>\ncasua<br/>\nlly, just out of curiosity, wondered aloud, &quot;Wonder what the probability<br/>\nis <br/>\nof randomly picking a red M&M out of the bag.&quot; My daughter dumped the<br/>\nbag in <br/>\nher lap and started sorting and counting. We went on from there -- after<br/>\n<br/>\nfiguring out the probability of picking one red M&M, I asked her,<br/>\njokingly, <br/>\n&quot;What&#39;s the probability of picking either a red or green or brown or ...<br/>\n&quot;-- <br/>\nlisting all the colors. It is a probability of 1 or 100 percent which<br/>\nled to <br/>\na little discussion about what 100 percent of something means. And so<br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that if you&#39;re going to unschool math, you owe it to the kids to<br/>\nbe <br/>\nwilling to have some mathy types of conversations and to make yourself<br/>\nlearn <br/>\nto enjoy them and get over your own math anxiety IF you have any.

I explain, offer, remark upon, show. I<br/>\nknow that it just is s difference of wording but that&#39;s important to me.<br/>\nOnce I moved away from school like words it was easier for me to grasp the<br/>\ncore of unschooling. As to Algebra, (or history or health or the other ) I<br/>\nfind that it comes along with life. You saw and your daughter saw algebra in<br/>\nuse with the PayPal questions. What a wonderful time to point out a neat way<br/>\nthat numbers work. I wouldn&#39;t have found it helpful to teach her algebra<br/>\nahead of time because I have found that when I tried &quot;teaching&quot; my children<br/>\nwere no longer interested. My kids would have said &quot;That&#39;s nnice mom&quot;, and<br/>\nwalked away. The long, boring repetitive &quot;schoolwork&quot; would have caused the<br/>\nlove of numbers and puzzles to disappear.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Anyway, she was so<br/>\nhappy when she solved the PayPal problem and was able to find that they<br/>\ntook 6.5% Now she has a skill to use.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think she may have been able to learn the same skill at the time the<br/>\nPayPal problem came up. That is how I have found unschooling to work.<br/>\nLearning the skill as the opportunity arises, rather than &quot;in school because<br/>\nshe may one day need it&quot; (institutional school or home school)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Rather than me just waiting to ask the magic question, &quot;Mom, may I learn<br/>\nsuch and such?&quot; Can she possibly know what she really wants? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I &quot;got&quot; unschooling, I thought that I would leave my kids alone, they<br/>\nwould de-school and when they were done, they would come to me and say, &quot;I<br/>\nwan&#39;t to learn about X&quot;<br/>\nI doesn&#39;t work like that! Unschooling children are not typically doing<br/>\nbookreports, or spontaneously making up science fair projects, or solving<br/>\nmath problems for fun. Some may, but most will be learning about different<br/>\nthings in more subtle ways. Watching TV, movies, reading books and<br/>\nmagazines, playing with dirt and rocks, talking with others, shopping,<br/>\nonlince surfing, PLAYING. Learning will cease to look like what it does in<br/>\nschool and begin to look more like how adults learn something new.<br/>\n<br/>\ns<br/>\n&lt;&lt;not considered USing if I introduce things for them to do, like math,<br/>\nand maybe nudge them to see if they are ready. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTO ME, it is not unschooling to wait for them to learn &quot;Math&quot; It is<br/>\nunschooling to see them learn about how numbers work together, how to manage<br/>\nan allowance, how to make the most economical purchase, to see them open<br/>\ntheir own bank account, to triple a recipe or to halve one, and to put<br/>\ntogether a huge lego structure that is perfectly proportioned (not like<br/>\nmine)<br/>\n.<br/>\n&lt;&lt;My middle daughter loves to use her Saxon math book.<br/>\nShe enjoys it so much, (she&#39;s an sequential type), it would break her<br/>\nheart if I took it away and hurt her feelings that I don&#39;t consider it<br/>\nvaluable anymore. Does that make sense?&gt;&gt;<br/>\nOf course, this is how your DD has learned up until now. It takes time for<br/>\nthem to understand and move away from the beliefs that school and school<br/>\nmethods is how one learns.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; My worst thought is that they would<br/>\nbe stuck into a job they hated and would live a stoic existence.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSlightly off the thread comment on this. Life today has changed from getting<br/>\nyour first job and staying until retirement. Jobs change,  careers change,<br/>\npeople change. They never have to be &quot;stuck in a job they hate&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I get the idea what it is, sometimes it seems like &quot;more work&quot; for those<br/>\nthat aren&#39;t ultra creative.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMost unschoolers are not ultra creative and finding new ways to get our<br/>\nchildren to learn what we feel is important as they go through thier &quot;School<br/>\nyears&quot;.<br/>\nWe are trusting that our children are able to learn things that *they* need<br/>\nto know, when *they* need to know it. Many of us believe that there is no<br/>\n&quot;body of knowledge&quot; that must be imparted to our children, they will learn,<br/>\njust as we do. I strive to show my children that whatever they want to know<br/>\nabout is out there for them to grab onto, when they need it. My goal is not<br/>\nto give them knowledge, it&#39;s to show them how to find that knowledge for<br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n.<br/>\n&lt;&lt;But when it comes to math and grammar. I don&#39;t know, I think that it&#39;s<br/>\nimportant to be direct about those things. I don&#39;t mean &quot;stuffing it&quot;<br/>\nbut just exposing them to it. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow could anyone NOT be exposed to math or grammar? It&#39;s all around us, not<br/>\njust found in Saxon Algebra 1/2 or Little-Brown&#39;s grammar text. It&#39;s on the<br/>\nPayPal site, or Goosebumps books or War& Peace or Stephen King&#39;s On Writing<br/>\nor balancing a checkbook.

It&#39;s fun<br/>\nand it&#39;s like a game. Even my Teen enjoys it!<br/>\nBut some here may not think that this is USing?&gt;&gt;<br/>\nThere may be many who feel that way. But just because someone says &quot;IMO,<br/>\nthat is not really unschooling&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you are wrong.<br/>\nI did some things in school that were fun and like a game. but what other<br/>\nchoice did I have? and it wasn&#39;t a game.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Elissa Cleaveland<br/>\n&quot;It is nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction<br/>\nhave<br/>\nnot yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry.&quot; A.

Algebra is just finding<br/>\nout what you don&#39;t know from what you do. When kids are exposed to math by<br/>\nusing it in the real world they develop an understanding of how numbers work<br/>\nthat most kids who learn math formally usually don&#39;t get.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the difference between learning Spanish formally in a classroom and<br/>\nlearning it by going to Spain and having to use it to get what you need.<br/>\nSomeone in a classroom may appear to know more because they are learning<br/>\nwhat they&#39;ll be tested on. Someone learning through immersion is learning<br/>\nhow to *use* the language, they&#39;re using great big huge concepts without<br/>\ntotally understanding them and getting feedback on how well they&#39;re using<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I taught her this with Saxon,<br/>\n&gt; meaning, she didn&#39;t come up with wanting to learn this herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When we teach them something that we are certain they will need to know and<br/>\nthey&#39;re happy we did it, it does reinforce the fear that they would never<br/>\nhave learned that on their own and what other things aren&#39;t they learning<br/>\nthat we should be teaching?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps a great deal to become conscious of what they are learning<br/>\n*without* being taught. That&#39;s the huge part of the puzzle that&#39;s missing.<br/>\nWe really only see what we&#39;ve taught them and we don&#39;t see the far greater<br/>\nnumber of things they&#39;ve learned on their own. And we tend not to value<br/>\nthose things too, because if they learned them without being taught then it<br/>\nseems they weren&#39;t all that difficult to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I talked<br/>\n&gt; her into doing it by calling the math &quot;puzzles to solve.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*Eeverything* in life can be approached as a puzzle to solve.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn an unschooling way the PayPal problem might have been presented as a<br/>\nproblem that you wanted a sounding board for. You could have explained the<br/>\nproblem and walked through it. She might have asked questions to help<br/>\nyou/her understand what was going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe might not have the same understanding after watching you but she would<br/>\nhave a foundation of understanding to build on so the next time percentages<br/>\ncame up she&#39;d have something to relate them to, another part to add to the<br/>\npiece of the puzzle that was already in place.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she had opportunities like the PayPal with her own money, she might have<br/>\nbrought the problem to you and you could have puzzled it out together.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe things we learn on our own because we need the information or skill is<br/>\nwhere the profound learning happens. Unfortunately it&#39;s quiet so we parents<br/>\ndon&#39;t get as much feedback from it as we do when we teach.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Rather than me just waiting to ask the magic question, &quot;Mom, may I learn<br/>\n&gt; such and such?&quot; Can she possibly know what she really wants? What I mean<br/>\n&gt; is do USer&#39;s just strike the match for the child and see if it burns and<br/>\n&gt; if not, then stop or do you wait for your child to ask for the match?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One of the hard parts of unschooling, I think, is in turning our thinking<br/>\naround from thinking in terms of subjects to thinking in terms of exploring<br/>\ninterests. The &quot;subjects&quot; should be the *tools* we reach for to make sense<br/>\nof what we do, not the goal themselves. History is meaningless unless we<br/>\nhave the questions we want answered that history can provide. (Like being<br/>\ninterested in the Little House series and being curious about why Laura&#39;s<br/>\nlife was as it was.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point in life is the bird house, not the hammer. As a side-effect of<br/>\nbuilding a bird house we learn how to use a hammer. The hammer is<br/>\nmeaningless without the uses it gets put to. And learning how to use a<br/>\nhammer is even more useless if it&#39;s learned for the sake of learning how to<br/>\nhammer &quot;just in case&quot;. Learning that way in fact limits someone&#39;s concept of<br/>\na hammer because it then becomes a tool for pounding nails. It won&#39;t be a<br/>\ntool for cracking nuts or a paperweight or to whack a wrench to loosen a<br/>\nbolt or a prop to test center of balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s inadequate but, like a problem in percentages you&#39;ve walked through<br/>\nfor your daughter out loud, it is a foundation, a beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is<br/>\n&gt; not considered USing if I introduce things for them to do, like math,<br/>\n&gt; and maybe nudge them to see if they are ready.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling is providing what the child needs today in order to achieve what<br/>\nhe&#39;s trying to do. He needs to have what he might need in reach and<br/>\naccessible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen your kids were learning to speak, did you speak to them as an adult,<br/>\nconcerned that they had to learn words like corporate takeover, radio<br/>\nastronomy, medulla oblongata, cartesian coordinates or they&#39;d never make it<br/>\nin the world? Or did you talk about the things they were interested in,<br/>\nnaturally immersing those words and subjects in the proper context of<br/>\nlanguage even if they didn&#39;t totally grasp every word you were saying and<br/>\nyet naturally at a level that wouldn&#39;t confound them totally?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo an unschooler doesn&#39;t think in terms of *leading* a child to what he<br/>\nneeds to know so much as making the opportunities to need those things<br/>\navailable. That can sound like an impossible task! How can we possibly<br/>\nsurround them with everything that&#39;s in a 9th grade science book? Well you<br/>\ncan and you can&#39;t ;-) That science book is just a distillation, just a tiny<br/>\nportion of what is in your child&#39;s life right now. The chapter on astronomy<br/>\nmay go in and trickle out unless the child has looked up with a wondering<br/>\nparent and looked for constellations or given the time to notice stars come<br/>\nin different colors or asked about the first &quot;star&quot; that appears at sunset<br/>\nor tried to find the various faces in the moon that other cultures have<br/>\nfound. It really doesn&#39;t need to go further than that (though, of course,<br/>\nsome kids may). It will create a sense of wonder and curiosity and good<br/>\nfeelings about the night sky that will be a foundation for learning more. A<br/>\ntextbook chapter the child has no interest in initially might spark an<br/>\ninterest that would have been sparked by the night sky but it&#39;s as likely to<br/>\nleave another child with no desire to learn more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you supply them with isn&#39;t the information, but the sense of wonder --<br/>\nyou&#39;ll need to recapture this too :-) -- and the resources to explore<br/>\nwherever their interests lead them. It doesn&#39;t mean you need every<br/>\neducational product on the market. It can be just a mom who can say &quot;Let&#39;s<br/>\ngo look it up with Google.&quot; :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My middle daughter loves to use her Saxon math book.<br/>\n&gt; She enjoys it so much, (she&#39;s an sequential type), it would break her<br/>\n&gt; heart if I took it away and hurt her feelings that I don&#39;t consider it<br/>\n&gt; valuable anymore. Does that make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s nothing valueless in anything a child is interested in. (Though<br/>\nsometimes it helps to come ask for some perspective when they&#39;ve been<br/>\nplaying a computer game for 3 weeks straight ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing wrong with textbooks if that&#39;s what the child likes. I think<br/>\nit can be comforting for adults if kids like textbooks and workbooks and we<br/>\ncan feel satisified they&#39;re &quot;doing math&quot; but that comfort can make us stop<br/>\nthere. We will be less likely to feel the need to supply the real world<br/>\ncontexts we would for a non-textbook child that will make math meaningful:<br/>\nallowance, games, Nintendo, cooking, counting and sorting, and so on and so<br/>\nforth.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in a way, yes, you should see it as less valuable because Saxon shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe the center of math but just one small aspect of math. (Saxon seems to<br/>\nwork best at teaching kids how to take math tests.) But you should also see<br/>\nit as valuable because it is valuable to your daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe really tricky part is to learn to see things that same way when they<br/>\nvalue learning all 251+ Pokemon names! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would like for them to have &quot;original thought.&quot; I want them to be<br/>\n&gt; creative and individuals who are not afraid to go against the grain if<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s what it takes to do right. I want them to find what they would<br/>\n&gt; love to do for a living and do it.

Creativity implies that you need to make the world entertaining<br/>\nso the kids want to know what you&#39;re sure they need to. No, all that&#39;s<br/>\nnecessary is being curious about life yourself. Share how happy you are over<br/>\nsomething you&#39;ve found or done. (Imagine how pleased you are when your child<br/>\ndoes this around you.) Stop and smell the roses. And wonder how the grapes<br/>\ngot all the way from Chili and what other movie did that actor play in and<br/>\nwhat happens when you type two random words into Google and are there any<br/>\nclues in the personal ads that tell you what kind of people they are and so<br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m a reader by heart and I listen to a lot of music.

(That&#39;s<br/>\nnot one of my skills so it&#39;t just an idea for those who might find it<br/>\nnatural.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you talk about why you like certain songs? Do you listen to music beyond<br/>\nyour &quot;comfort zone&quot; or explore some world music?<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you planted things in the garden that kids might enjoy? (Their<br/>\nappreciation isn&#39;t a necessary part of the deal. Wanting to create an<br/>\nenvironment that provides them with things to stumble across is though.)<br/>\nHave you asked them if they&#39;d like you to plant something for them? Or given<br/>\nthem a section of the yard that belongs to them to do with as they please?<br/>\n(Plant flowers, vegetables, turn it into a mud pit ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDo they collect things at the beach? Do you look them up and observe them?<br/>\nBe curious yourself :-) It&#39;s not necessary for the kids to pursue it if they<br/>\naren&#39;t interested, but it is important that they see you being curious.<br/>\n(Don&#39;t force yourself. Just find natural opportunities to be curious. You<br/>\nmight need to give yourself a little shove if you haven&#39;t learned something<br/>\njust for the sake of curiosity in a while! But it can be infectious :-) To<br/>\nyou and the kids.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But when it comes to math and grammar.

But you need to<br/>\nmake sure the opportunities are there and available.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We are making a homophone chart. I just handed them a Scholastic book<br/>\n&gt; (similar to a short dictionary) and I asked them to look up three words,<br/>\n&gt; even it they didn&#39;t know what they meant, but liked the way that they<br/>\n&gt; sounded. We made up fun sentences verbally with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That sounds like it could be fun. :-) And this isn&#39;t meant to discourage you<br/>\nif they are having fun at it. *Anything* they enjoy they will learn<br/>\nsomething from. Just ask yourself why you feel they need to know homophones.<br/>\nWhat use are they? They are like surprises hidden in English and there&#39;s a<br/>\ngreat deal of learning that can happen around stumbling on such things --<br/>\nlike *why* do two totally differently spelled words sound alike and *why* do<br/>\ntwo words spelled alike have different pronounciations -- or bringing them<br/>\nup like a puzzle to ponder over. But the only &quot;need&quot; of them in kids<br/>\nlearning is when teachers are teaching reading and spelling and making sure<br/>\nthe kids don&#39;t mix up the spellings of two, to and too so the teacher can<br/>\ncheck off that they &quot;learned&quot; those to provide feedback to parents,<br/>\nadministrators and the state.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids *can* learn to read and spell without ever dealing with homophones<br/>\nformally. They&#39;ll just absorb them. Just as they accept without even<br/>\nthinking about it that spoken English is a great deal different in formality<br/>\nof structure than written English. But it&#39;s fun to point them out and talk<br/>\nabout them when they or you stumble on them :-) Or even if you think, &quot;Gee,<br/>\nthey might be interested in this because it&#39;s interesting so I&#39;ll get this<br/>\nbook and run it by whoever is interested.&quot; (Which is a rather poor excuse<br/>\nfor a sentence in a discussion of grammar learned through writing ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am particular<br/>\n&gt; about handwriting. I think that children should have good handwriting<br/>\n&gt; skills, (when they are completely ready).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why? I don&#39;t mean that question in an attacking way. I mean, stop and ask<br/>\nyourself why. Usually when we ask ourselves why and we get irritated that<br/>\nsomeone&#39;s asking it&#39;s because the answer is &quot;just because it&#39;s important&quot;<br/>\nbut we can&#39;t really pinpoint why.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s another one of the hard parts about unschooling. It&#39;s digging<br/>\ndeep and figuring out why it is we think such and such is important. And<br/>\nthere are often so *many* things that are important &quot;just because&quot;! In a way<br/>\nit&#39;s easier just to do the things we think are important even if the doing<br/>\nmight be rough (in terms of kid resistance) or need creativity (to make it<br/>\nfun so the kids don&#39;t resist so much). It&#39;s tough to let go of that little<br/>\npiece of the world we thought we had control over. (But there *are* rewards<br/>\nin terms of kids learning and being and becoming who they are.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDoctors have horrible handwriting.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalligraphers need very nice writing. But do calligraphers come from having<br/>\nbeen made to practice until their handwriting was nice or is the nice<br/>\nhandwriting an indication that someone might enjoy a book on calligraphy?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are the consequences of having bad handwriting? How about not being<br/>\nable to fill out a job application so someone else can read it? But if it&#39;s<br/>\na job the person wants, isn&#39;t that a huge motivator to learn? Do we really<br/>\nthink that our kids would not self-improve for something they want? Haven&#39;t<br/>\nthey *always* done that? The only difference is we have a mental block about<br/>\nself-improving over something &quot;academic&quot;. And probably the reason is because<br/>\nacademics gets force fed through dull lectures and hours of dull practice so<br/>\nthe various subjects -- and often learning itself --- becomes a huge<br/>\nmountain to climb.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut an unschooled child doesn&#39;t have the weight of those years of dull<br/>\npractice tied to his concept of learning. Improving handwriting is like<br/>\nimproving skateboarding -- except easier on the knees and elbows ;-) All it<br/>\ntakes is some greater attentiveness, perhaps asking some questions on letter<br/>\nformation, perhaps going through a book. Anything learned for personally<br/>\nmeaningful reasons is learned almost effortlessly, because the effort has<br/>\nmeaning and can often be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, all of this digging deep and asking ourselves to reexamine what we<br/>\nthink is important and why we think it&#39;s important takes a lot of time and<br/>\nwork! :-) But to those who are trying to achieve the goals that unschooling<br/>\nis best suited for it&#39;s more than worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My children all have beautiful<br/>\n&gt; handwriting because of a program I&#39;ve taught them. They love to make<br/>\n&gt; beautiful letters. So they do that with the homophone chart. It&#39;s fun<br/>\n&gt; and it&#39;s like a game. Even my Teen enjoys it!<br/>\n&gt; But some here may not think that this is USing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If they love to make beautiful letters great :-) If it&#39;s fun and a game<br/>\ngreat :-) Scatter some calligraphy books around the house. Point out<br/>\ninteresting handwriting. Read about the development of writing. (*If* they<br/>\nwant to.) Try out some Chinese brushes and some Chinese calligraphy. Look at<br/>\nthe Book of Kells and other illuminated manuscripts. (If they want to. Or do<br/>\nit for yourself.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut your pride in their having accomplished what you hoped they would will<br/>\nget in the way of &quot;getting&quot; unschooling. Unschooling won&#39;t be about you and<br/>\nwhat you can do but about them and what they can and want to do for<br/>\nthemselves. Again, that&#39;s not meant as a criticism. Only as an indicator of<br/>\nwhere you are from where an unschooler is. And it only needs to concern you<br/>\nas important if you want to get from where you are to where the unschooler<br/>\nis. If you&#39;re happy where you are and your kids are leading joyfilled lives<br/>\nthen forcing yourself to do something different may be more trouble than<br/>\nit&#39;s worth. But if there are parts that aren&#39;t working, then it&#39;s worth<br/>\nsitting back and wondering why and how it could be different.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling could end up looking almost exactly like what you&#39;re doing,<br/>\noffering fun activities. The only difference is in the expectation that they<br/>\nmust learn such and such. If they can say &quot;No, thanks, I&#39;d rather go play<br/>\nNintendo,&quot; and you can carry on with the kids who are interested or just on<br/>\nyour own then it&#39;s probably unschooling. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] EMAIL SUGGESTION: ATTN MODERATOR","postDate":"1019634763","msgId":35793,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyNS5mOGRhNGY2LjI5ZjdiZTRiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35786,"nextInTopic":35796,"prevInTime":35792,"nextInTime":35794,"topicId":35753,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/23/2002 5:48:52 PM Pacific Daylight Time, ...

She learned some of the formulas for<br/>\nalgebra. She figured out how much the percentage was by rewording the<br/>\nproblem and finding the right formula. I taught her this with Saxon,<br/>\nmeaning, she didn&#39;t come up with wanting to learn this herself. She<br/>\nreally didn&#39;t want to know much about math at all. But I insisted that<br/>\nshe at least &quot;try&quot; and to not allow the math to intimidate her. I talked<br/>\nher into doing it by calling the math &quot;puzzles to solve.&quot; It lightened<br/>\nthe mood considerably. She wasn&#39;t gun-ho, but she did it. I think to<br/>\nplease me. (This is BEFORE I looked into USing.) Anyway, she was so<br/>\nhappy when she solved the PayPal problem and was able to find that they<br/>\ntook 6.5% Now she has a skill to use. Same with learning parameters, she<br/>\ncan figure on her own how much carpet in her bedroom she wants right<br/>\naway. I think that she learned that maybe I do have some educational<br/>\nthings to impart to her because I know she is ready for them and she<br/>\nwill be alert as when to use the new techniques as situations arise.<br/>\nRather than me just waiting to ask the magic question, &quot;Mom, may I learn<br/>\nsuch and such?&quot; Can she possibly know what she really wants? What I mean<br/>\nis do USer&#39;s just strike the match for the child and see if it burns and<br/>\nif not, then stop or do you wait for your child to ask for the match? Is<br/>\nnot considered USing if I introduce things for them to do, like math,<br/>\nand maybe nudge them to see if they are ready. That&#39;s what I do anyway.<br/>\nMy middle daughter loves to use her Saxon math book. <br/>\nShe enjoys it so much, (she&#39;s an sequential type), it would break her<br/>\nheart if I took it away and hurt her feelings that I don&#39;t consider it<br/>\nvaluable anymore. Does that make sense?<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are your goals for your kids?<br/>\nI would like for them to have &quot;original thought.&quot; I want them to be<br/>\ncreative and individuals who are not afraid to go against the grain if<br/>\nthat&#39;s what it takes to do right. I want them to find what they would<br/>\nlove to do for a living and do it. My worst thought is that they would<br/>\nbe stuck into a job they hated and would live a stoic existence.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you fear most as far as homeschooling your kids is concerned?<br/>\nThat one day the government with produce laws forbidding homeschooling.<br/>\nI have no fear of homeschooling otherwise. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you want unschooling in a nutshell?

You won&#39;t &quot;get&quot; unschooling<br/>\nfrom<br/>\nthem but it might be enough to give you a better idea.<br/>\nI get the idea what it is, sometimes it seems like &quot;more work&quot; for those<br/>\nthat aren&#39;t ultra creative.<br/>\nI&#39;m a reader by heart and I listen to a lot of music. I&#39;m about to do<br/>\nsome gardening. I&#39;m not super artsy though I encourage my kids to do<br/>\nart. My son has a volcano lab that we are going to get into tomorrow. <br/>\nI talk to my children about current events etc. We spend a lot of time<br/>\non the beach too. <br/>\nBut when it comes to math and grammar.

Most will come from the questions that<br/>\nother people ask, from serendipitous posts, from having read something that<br/>\ndidn&#39;t seem relevant that later pops up in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting unschooling, like understanding life, involves having the whole<br/>\nworld thrown at you and learning what to pay attention to at anyone time<br/>\nwhile still letting the rest wash over you. If you had just concentrated on<br/>\nthe words your child wanted to know (milk, up, juice, for instance) without<br/>\nimmersing him in a sea of the English language, he wouldn&#39;t realize there<br/>\nwas more to English than what he could immediately grasp. He couldn&#39;t<br/>\nrealize that he needed to ask about sentences if he didn&#39;t know they<br/>\nexisted.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe picture trying to learn how to sail, one factoid at a time. Which<br/>\nfactoids would you choose to learn? In order to learn to sail, you need to<br/>\nimmerse yourself in it so you can experience the whole big picture.

This list is an<br/>\nongoing messy dialog about changing thinking. It isn&#39;t easy for most people<br/>\nto understand how learning can happen without teaching, especially because<br/>\nunschooling needs to look different for every family because it is centered<br/>\naround each unique child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am concerned about the bickering.

Those who care to have<br/>\nheated &quot;discussions&quot; can do so without involving the entire list?<br/>\nI have been out of town and I&#39;m new to the list. I&#39;m trying to filter<br/>\nthough to find the good stuff to help me with my unschooling decision,<br/>\nbut I&#39;ve discovered that over half of the emails are replies back and<br/>\nforth on several different agreements! It&#39;s wearing me out. <br/>\nI joined this list over a week ago and found that I had to clear away<br/>\nquite a bit each day.<br/>\nWith 690 people on here, it might be a good idea to do &quot;replies go to<br/>\nthe author.&quot;<br/>\nI am a busy mom and I&#39;m trying to figure out if this list is really<br/>\ngoing to be overly time consuming or if it&#39;s going to weigh my heart<br/>\ndown with bickering back and forth? I&#39;m thinking of leaving.<br/>\nI don&#39;t find the exposure to arguing, nit picking and intolerance of<br/>\neach other enlightening at all,<br/>\nSome are forgetting to change the subject lines to what the topic has<br/>\nmorphed into. I can safely say almost 1/3 haven&#39;t been faithful in this<br/>\narea so far. It&#39;s exhausting!<br/>\nI feel sorry for those that do &quot;digest&quot; what a mess it would be.<br/>\nI&#39;m on a list that does &quot;replies go to the author of the message&quot; and<br/>\nthere are virtually NO REPEATS.<br/>\nYou may change the To on your email to address the group when it is<br/>\nneeded, and if you feel that the group will benefit by something you say<br/>\nin reply to someone&#39;s post, then that&#39;s great too, but at least this<br/>\nairing out will be kept to a minimum. Most people will not post to the<br/>\nlist something they know should have gone to a specific person, most<br/>\npeople are reluctant to post to someone&#39;s box something that is<br/>\noffensive or rude in any way. <br/>\nI don&#39;t sit at my PC all day, so I can&#39;t keep up with this. <br/>\nI wish members would  keep the subject line as detailed as possible.<br/>\nModerator: Can you email me privately as to why the list can&#39;t be set at<br/>\n&quot;replies go to author?&quot;<br/>\nI have met a lady in my hsing group that was on this list and couldn&#39;t<br/>\nkeep up either. It looks like it will happen to me if things continue as<br/>\nthey are.<br/>\nSome of folks have been on here a long time and obviously feel this is<br/>\ntheir territory. It doesn&#39;t seem that there is a lot of friendliness to<br/>\nnew comers. (Though I have seen some nice people here too! Please don&#39;t<br/>\nmisunderstand me.)<br/>\nAs I can see, USing is just now getting a lot of recognition, many<br/>\nfamilies will be checking into it, it&#39;d be nice to have a non-hostile<br/>\nenvironment to converse in. I would like to refer people here, but I<br/>\nfeel I&#39;d be complicating their lives if do it now.<br/>\nI&#39;m saying this is love<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\n <br/>\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br/>\n.· ´¨¨))  -:¦:-<br/>\n           ¸.·´ .·´¨¨))<br/>\n        ((¸¸.·´   .·´   -:¦:-Valerie Cifuentes<br/>\n      -:¦:-    ((¸¸.·´*<br/>\nI CAN NO LONGER ACCEPT FORWARDS, CHAIN LETTERS AND PETITIONS.
