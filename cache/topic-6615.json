Clueless, I asked why he was buying so many.  When he replied he was <br/>\ngoing to feed them to his snake, I screamed, &quot;I&#39;ll take one!&quot;  I am a devout <br/>\nvegetarian with a tender heart, and I wanted to save even just one of these <br/>\ncreatures from the jaws of death.  I bought a tank, bedding, food and some <br/>\ntoys, named the new family member Walt and set up his cage in my kitchen so <br/>\nwe could all watch him.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I don&#39;t know if Walt just had a personal hygiene problem or if this is <br/>\ntrue for all mice, but Walt had a very undesirable odor.  I had to move him <br/>\nto a spare bedroom, and no matter how often I cleaned his cage, he reeked.  <br/>\nIt got to the point where no one but me went in that bedroom, and I only went <br/>\nin to clean the cage and make a hasty retreat.  By that point, I was so <br/>\ndisgusted by poor Walt that I could have fed him to a snake myself!  I ended <br/>\nup giving him back to the pet store, and I feel guilty about this even three <br/>\nyears later.<br/>\n<br/>\n   So I guess this is my question: Walt was a white mouse with red eyes.

They make great pets, but <br/>\nusually not the wild ones.  :-(  Sorry.  I would let him go, and replace him <br/>\nwith a store bought mouse.  They usually cost under $2.  You can put them in <br/>\na little mouse house (acquarium is fine).  I usually use some kind of store <br/>\nbought bedding plus some cotton, hair from haircuts, and paper towels for <br/>\nthem to dig and burrow in.  You can feed them store bought mouse food, plus <br/>\nthey love fresh veggies (tiny bits), sunflower seeds, bread pieces soaked in <br/>\nmilk, and peanut butter.  You can train them to walk all over you (if you <br/>\ndon&#39;t mind their droppings).  We don&#39;t have any right now, but when we did, <br/>\nthey were great fun to watch.  Females can live together nicely.  Stick a <br/>\nwheel in the cage, some toilet paper tubes, and watch the fun.  I think they <br/>\nare much more interesting than hamsters or gerbils.  Our last two were a <br/>\nbeautiful sleek black male named Eeeka, and a long-haired mail named Huck who <br/>\nused to &quot;talk&quot; to the kids.
