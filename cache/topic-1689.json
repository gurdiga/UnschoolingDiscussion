Having read your post just now, it just emphasizes the need for people <br/>\nto know what they are talking about before they sound off on ANY subject.   <br/>\nSuperiority is a killer to any caring and loving group, no matter what the  <br/>\nsubject.  I am so sorry that your child has to go through this, that any <br/>\nchild does for that matter.  In all fairness to others, I think that the <br/>\nreason so many people get so upset about these meds, is because so many <br/>\nDoctors and school systems have mis handled these terms and meds, to make it <br/>\na convenience.  We all know someone who has a perfectly normal child that <br/>\ntheir parents really don&#39;t want to bother with, and they push for the meds.  <br/>\nThis is most likely what everyone has been talking about, but, again, we <br/>\nshould never make blanket statements about anyone or any group. Everybody <br/>\nlaughs and groans and jokes about preteens, how they have smart attitudes, <br/>\nmouhts and mood swings.

I agree that this happens far too often for the<br/>\nconvenience of the schools.  i have a busy kid and i&#39;ve already had a<br/>\ntaste of this recently.  We were at the park and a gal who had been<br/>\noff in the distance watching my 3 yo son play with her 5 yo son came<br/>\nover and struck up a conversation with me.  they were having fun and<br/>\ngetting along but she had been closely watching his behavior - or<br/>\nshould i say &quot;energy level&quot;.  turns out she works at the &quot;Head Start&quot;<br/>\nschool and was suggesting that i should look into getting Sterling<br/>\nenrolled.  we were on the subject of how advanced he is and she<br/>\nproceeded to tell me about how they have &quot;free testing&quot; 3 times a year so<br/>\nyou can find out where your child is at even if you don&#39;t plan on<br/>\nenrolling them into the school.  i took it as being more of<br/>\na skills and academic test combined with developmental skills so that<br/>\nthey know how to place them with other kids of the same level.  well,<br/>\njust for kicks, i decided to look into it further for the testing<br/>\neven though i had no plans to enroll him.  funny...  they test in<br/>\nNovember?  h-m-m-m.  so what is covered in this testing i ask!  and i<br/>\nquote &quot;Oh, we are looking for any deficits or learning disorders the<br/>\nchild might have!&quot;  URGH!!!!  so this &quot;teacher&quot; who is not qualified<br/>\nto make this sort of diagnosis had concluded in 15 minutes of<br/>\nwatching Sterling on the playground that he needed to be tested for a<br/>\nlearning disorder??  she obviously concluded ADD just because of his<br/>\nspontanity and energy level!  NO THANK YOU!<br/>\n<br/>\ni hope this helps with the other side of the picture and why some of<br/>\nus go bonkers over the idea of &quot;busy kids&quot; being diagnosed as ADD and<br/>\nbeing drugged into submission for the convenience of the schools.<br/>\nand yes i do agree that some kids truly are ADD and can benefit<br/>\ngreatly from the proper treatment whether it be Ritalin or some other<br/>\nalternative method that works and that is appropriate for the degree of<br/>\nthe ADD.<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;d love to respond to more of your message but it is LATE and i need<br/>\nsome sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMichele Moss<br/>\nMom of Sterling Tyler age 3 yrs old<br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Resource Web site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.icstech.net/~michele\">http://www.icstech.net/~michele</a><br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Discussion Group:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/list/psk\">http://www.egroups.com/list/psk</a><br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nATTN ONELIST USERS: stay current on the latest activities,<br/>\nprograms, & features at ONElist by joining our member newsletter at<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce</a> &quot;&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nCheck it out!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"mrstar","from":"&quot;mrstar&quot; &lt;mrstar@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"wA1GtkBcezCW2n9qBwJeMW8M7AjI50Y8xdWpn2SzpvHlepoAOT6n3X4XofRanIx_CxGQWC3sBMZQUEki0GtC_S3dqLY","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: Fw: ADD/Custody Issue","postDate":"933949099","msgId":1752,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xMzkuMTc1Mi45NTkyNjk3NDBAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":1751,"nextInTopic":1760,"prevInTime":1751,"nextInTime":1753,"topicId":1689,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Okay, here is a really long really well researched and very provaocative article on the issue at hand.

With the numbers of afflicted children escalating at<br/>\nepidemic proportions each year, just like the pre-Salc era there is<br/>\nreason to believe that parents must fear for their children contracting<br/>\nthis disease. The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health predicts that<br/>\nby the year 2000 ten million children will be consuming psychiatric<br/>\ndrugs for the treatment of this disorder (Nun 1998). Identified by the<br/>\nmain characteristics of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity, it<br/>\nruins the lives of many, tearing families and schools apart. But<br/>\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is not a real disease.<br/>\nThere is no scientific evidence to identify its existence, nor are there<br/>\nscientific means available for its identification, detection and<br/>\ntreatment. Rather ADHD is an invention designed solely for the financial<br/>\nbenefit of psychiatrists, drug manufacturers and schools who capitalize<br/>\non the misfortune of others. Worst of all, treatment of this fake<br/>\ndisorder usually involves the prescription of powerful, addictive<br/>\nstimulants such as amphetamines to young children, adolescents and<br/>\nadults. The adverse effects from these drugs can be unbearable,<br/>\ndebilitating and even potentially fatal. Using propaganda and coercion,<br/>\npsychiatrists and psychologists have duped well-meaning parents,<br/>\nteachers and politicians who are unaware of the truth of the ADHD scam.<br/>\nPsychiatry is creating a dangerous situation that will affect the<br/>\ntotality of society.<br/>\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a set of behaviors<br/>\nwhich have been classified as a disease by the American Psychiatric<br/>\nAssociation. The official standard for ADHD requires any combination of<br/>\neight out of fourteen symptoms, the first five being the most useful or<br/>\ndiscriminating (Breggin 1994, Wiseman 1995). They include:<br/>\n1. often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat. In adolescents<br/>\nthis may be limited to subjected feelings of restlessness.<br/>\n2. Has difficulty remaining seated when required to do so.<br/>\n3. Is easily distracted by extraneous stimuli.<br/>\n4. Has difficulty awaiting turn in games or group situations.<br/>\n5. Often blurts out answers to questions before they have been<br/>\ncompleted.<br/>\n6. Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly.<br/>\n7. Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities.<br/>\n8. Often loses things necessary to tasks or activities.<br/>\n9. Is often forgetful in daily activities.<br/>\n10. Is often on the go or often acts as if driven by a motor.<br/>\n11. Often talks excessively.<br/>\n12. Often has difficulty following instructions.<br/>\n13. Often has difficulty playing quietly.<br/>\n14. Often interrupts others.<br/>\nWhile many may be amused by the above catalog of common childhood<br/>\nbehaviors, these have been defined by the American Psychiatric<br/>\nAssociation in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental<br/>\nDisorders as legitimate symptoms of a physical disease. This disease is<br/>\ndiagnosed by observing the behavior of children and adolescents and<br/>\nchoosing any combination of eight of the above symptoms which are being<br/>\nmanifested. ADHD is commonly diagnosed by elementary school teachers who<br/>\nuse a behavior check list to identify a biologic defect in the brain<br/>\n(Baughman 1996). It is also measured by giving a child a series of tests<br/>\nthat are completed on a piece of paper, or by testing the child&#39;s<br/>\nability to perform tasks and follow directions. Dr. Fred Baughman is a<br/>\n35-year pediatric neurologist and a fellow of the American Academy of<br/>\nNeurology. In response to these various methods of diagnosis of ADHD he<br/>\nstates: &quot;For all their talk of chemical imbalance in the brain,<br/>\npsychiatrists order no blood, urine or spinal fluid tests and do no<br/>\nbrain scans of the sort that their researchers claim validate disorders<br/>\nor diseases.&quot;<br/>\nContrary to Baughman&#39;s opinion, many<br/>\npsychiatrists and psychologists will assert that ADHD has biochemical or<br/>\nneurologic etiologies. These doctors will claim that scientific studies<br/>\nexist that give reason to believe that some abnormal defect may exist.<br/>\nTo these experts Dr. T. P. Nun, M.D., Th.D. responds &quot;To this day there<br/>\nis not one study done by anyone that proves that hyperactivity is caused<br/>\nby brain damage or a chemical imbalance.&quot; Dr. Theodore J. La Vaque,<br/>\nPh.D. concurs by asserting that &quot;to date, there is no substantive<br/>\nmedical evidence supporting the &#39;brain disorder&#39; hypothesis.&quot; Even the<br/>\nAmerican Psychiatric Association admitted in its Diagnostic and<br/>\nStatistical manual of Mental Disorders that there are &quot;no laboratory<br/>\nfindings that have been established as diagnostic&quot; for Attention Deficit<br/>\nHyperactivity Disorder. Dr. Baughman commented: &quot;Confronted with<br/>\nchildren whom psychologists, psychiatrists and teachers claimed had<br/>\nADHD, I have not been able to find any physical abnormality, no disease<br/>\nwhatsoever.&quot; According to Paul Leber, M.D. of the U.S. Food and Drug<br/>\nAdministration, &quot;As of yet no distinctive pathophysiology for the<br/>\ndisorder has been delineated.&quot; &quot;We are also unaware,&quot; notes Gene Haislip<br/>\nof the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, &quot;that ADHD has been validated as a<br/>\nbiologic organic syndrome or disease.&quot; Dr. Lawrence Diller, M.D. was a<br/>\nconferee at the 1996 DEA conference on stimulant use in the treatment of<br/>\nADHD. In a letter to Dr. Baughman, he wrote: &quot;The reason why you have<br/>\nbeen unable to obtain any articles or studies presenting clear and<br/>\nconfirming evidence of a physical or chemical abnormality associated<br/>\nwith ADHD is that there is none.&quot; And yet despite the overwhelming<br/>\nevidence that ADHD has yet to be proven as having any physical etiology,<br/>\nmany biopsychiatrists still assert that it does. Their beliefs are<br/>\nfounded on the idea proposed in 1865 by Zurich psychiatrist Wilhelm<br/>\nGriesinger who claimed that since the majority of nerve coverage was in<br/>\nthe brain, all mental problems must be brain diseases. Conduct,<br/>\ntherefore, though viewed for centuries to be an independent function<br/>\nfrom the body was now declared to be symptoms of an illness. Unverified<br/>\neven today by the scientific method, these suppositions form the<br/>\nunderpinning for most psychiatric practice and theory (Wiseman 1995).<br/>\nAmil Kraepelin was one of the first psychologists to work on a system<br/>\nfor codifying human behavior while simultaneously acknowledging that<br/>\npsychiatry had no effective treatments or cures for most psychiatric<br/>\ndisorders. In 1932, Frankwood E. Williams, director of the U.S. National<br/>\nCommittee for Mental Hygiene confessed: &quot;The basic question with which<br/>\npsychiatrists and particularly those interested in mental hygiene start<br/>\nis what are the causes of mental and nervous disease. This question has<br/>\nbeen repeatedly raised during the 22 years of organized mental hygiene<br/>\nuntil it almost becomes a ritual, and like a ritual has led to nothing<br/>\nbut repetition, not even a start.&quot; Dr. Rex William Cowdry, director of<br/>\nthe U.S. National Institute of Mental Health in 1995 testified before a<br/>\nCongressional committee: &quot;We don&#39;t know the causes � we don&#39;t have the<br/>\nmethods of curing these illnesses yet.&quot; And yet despite &quot;not knowing the<br/>\ncauses,&quot; psychiatrists continue to prescribe drugs for abnormal conduct<br/>\nwhich they haven&#39;t even identified as having any physical connection.<br/>\nThe basis for their prescription is the much touted neurobiologic<br/>\ndisorder theory, which claims that abnormal behavior, emotions and<br/>\nthoughts are due to chemical imbalances in the brain, usually improper<br/>\nneurotransmitter levels. On this theory psychiatrist David Kaiser<br/>\ncomments: &quot;Modern psychiatry has yet to convincingly prove the genetic<br/>\nand biologic cause of any single mental illness. Patients have been<br/>\ndiagnosed with chemical imbalances despite the fact that no test exists<br/>\nto support such a claim, and there is no real conception of what a<br/>\ncorrect chemical balance would look like.&quot; New York psychiatrist Ron<br/>\nLeifer states his view quite clearly: &quot;There is no biological imbalance.<br/>\nWhen people come to me and say they have a biochemical imbalance, I say,<br/>\n&#39;Show me your lab tests.&#39; There are no lab tests, so what&#39;s the chemical<br/>\nimbalance?&quot; &quot;What they have done is medicalize many problems which don&#39;t<br/>\nhave demonstrable biologic causes,&quot; explains one California<br/>\npsychiatrist.<br/>\nDespite the overwhelming lack of evidence to support the biochemical<br/>\ntheories, those diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder<br/>\nare usually given drugs to treat their behavior problems. The drugs<br/>\ngiven are usually stimulants in the same classification of amphetamines<br/>\nlike speed and cocaine. The most common drugs prescribed for ADHD are<br/>\nRitalin, Dexedrine and the central nervous system stimulant Cylert. The<br/>\npsychiatrists prescribing these drugs to their patients and the<br/>\nmanufacturers of these drugs insist that they are &quot;safe,&quot; however<br/>\nsubstantial evidence has suggested that the adverse reactions to these<br/>\ndrugs are probably far more common than the literature suggests. Except<br/>\nwhen a drug is brand new, physicians usually don&#39;t report or publish<br/>\ntheir negative side effects, and many are unaware that there is a<br/>\nmechanism of informing the drug manufacturers and the FDA of these<br/>\neffects (Breggin 1994). In addition, advocates of the psychiatric<br/>\ndrugging of children have proven themselves to be especially unwilling<br/>\nto examine or underscore their effects. Ritalin is the most<br/>\ncommonly-prescribed drug for someone with ADHD. Ritalin is<br/>\npharmacologically classified with amphetamines. It has the same effects,<br/>\nside effects and risks. Scientists report that Ritalin affects the brain<br/>\nexactly like Cocaine does. The APA&#39;s 1989 Tome Treatment of Psychiatric<br/>\nDisorders observes that cocaine, amphetamines and methyl phenidate<br/>\n(Ritalin) are neuropharmacologically alike, citing evidence of similar<br/>\nabuse patterns. The clinical effects between Ritalin and cocaine cannot<br/>\nbe differentiated in laboratory tests, and they can substitute for each<br/>\nother and cause similar behaviors in addicted animals. The DSM III-R<br/>\nlumps Ritalin, cocaine and amphetamine abuse into the same category. The<br/>\nU.S. Drug Enforcement Agency classifies Ritalin into the same addiction<br/>\ncategory, Schedule II, as other amphetamines, cocaine, morphine, opium<br/>\nand barbiturates. A California study of adolescents diagnosed with ADHD<br/>\nfound that those who had been treated with Ritalin were three times more<br/>\nlikely to use cocaine as adults. Even Ciba-Geigy Pharmaceutical Company,<br/>\nmanufacturer of Ritalin admitted that their drug was a &quot;drug of<br/>\ndependency.&quot; In 1985 they published the following warning: Drug<br/>\nDependence: Ritalin should be given cautiously to emotionally unstable<br/>\npatients such as those with a history of drug dependence or alcoholism<br/>\nbecause such patients may increase dosage on their own initiative.<br/>\nChronically abusive use can lead to marked tolerance and psychic<br/>\ndependence with varying degrees of abnormal behavior. Frank psychotic<br/>\nepisodes can occur especially with parental abuse. Careful supervision<br/>\nis required during drug withdrawal since severe depression as well as<br/>\nthe effects of chronic overactivity can be unmasked. In the 1980s<br/>\nRitalin was a very popular street drug before being replaced by other<br/>\nstimulants. Today Ritalin is used illegally in combination with other<br/>\ndrugs by drug addicts. In 1986 the International Journal of The<br/>\nAddictions published over 105 adverse reactions from the drug. These<br/>\ninclude nervousness and insomnia, hypertensivity (high blood pressure),<br/>\nanorexia, nausea, dizziness, headaches, drowsiness, blood pressure and<br/>\npulse changes, tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), angina (sudden pain),<br/>\nabdominal pain, loss of appetite, weight loss and toxic psychosis. Some<br/>\nchildren can develop involuntary ticks and twitching from using the<br/>\ndrug, known as Touret&#39;s syndrome. The number of emergency room cases<br/>\nrelated to methyl phenidate for children ages 10-14 in the United States<br/>\nincreased ten times since 1990 and surpassed the level of<br/>\ncocaine-related emergencies for the same age group in 1950. More harmful<br/>\nthan the side effects, however, are the withdrawal effects from missing<br/>\neven one dosage. Like any other stimulant, these effects include<br/>\ncrashing with depression, exhaustion, irritability and suicidal<br/>\nfeelings. Even the American Psychiatric Association admitted in 1987<br/>\nthat &quot;suicide is the major complication of withdrawal from Ritalin and<br/>\nsimilar drugs.&quot; (DSM III-R). Many parents are not informed that as a<br/>\nstimulant, Ritalin causes the very behaviors it is supposed to cure,<br/>\nsuch as inattention, hyperactivity and aggression. When this occurs the<br/>\nchild is often given a higher dosage or an even stronger agent such as a<br/>\nneuroleptic, resulting in a vicious circle of increased drug toxicity.<br/>\nRitalin can also suppress growth, height and weight. These facts are<br/>\noften explained to parents in a way so as not to frighten them. What<br/>\nparents often are not told, however, is that it can also cause permanent<br/>\nbrain damage from long-term exposure. Cylert and Dexedrine both share<br/>\nmany of the common adverse effects of other stimulants. In addition,<br/>\nCylert can also cause liver toxicity. A 1997 &quot;Dear Doctor&quot; letter cited<br/>\nten reports over 21 years of acute liver failure in children taking the<br/>\ndrug.<br/>\nADHD --is not based on scientific proof or evidence, but rather opinion<br/>\nof behavior. In countries where drugs are rarely given to children such<br/>\nas Denmark, Norway and Sweden, ADHD is rarely diagnosed. Doctors working<br/>\nfor Britain&#39;s National Health Service are prohibited from prescribing<br/>\nRitalin in routine practice because it is not on the approved drug list<br/>\nof the British National Formulary. In 1995 the International Narcotics<br/>\nand Control Board reported an increase in worldwide production of methyl<br/>\nphenidate from 3.0 tons in 1990 to 8.5 tons in 1994, with the United<br/>\nStates accounting for 90 percent of the consumption and a small<br/>\npercentage of doctors accounting for the majority of prescriptions. In<br/>\naddition to ADHD having a cultural bias, males are far more frequently<br/>\ngiven a Disruptive Behavior Disorder i.e. ADHD classification. This is<br/>\nbecause male children are trained by society to act resentfully or<br/>\nrebelliously towards female authority. In fact, most adult men resent<br/>\nbeing told what to do by women. Girls are conditioned by society to<br/>\nlisten attentively to whatever authority says, and what any male says.<br/>\nThere is no &quot;compulsive obedience disorder&quot; for girls because labeling a<br/>\nchild with a DBD is an instrument of control. Even researchers at the<br/>\nNIMH confirm that short-term effects of Ritalin are limited to<br/>\n&quot;behavioral control.&quot; As girls receive increasingly confusing messages<br/>\nfrom modern society about assertiveness, more and more young girls are<br/>\nbeing diagnosed with DBDs. Often these girls share potential leadership<br/>\nqualities (Breggin and Breggin, 1984). As it&#39;s name implies, Attention<br/>\nDeficit Disorder is a disease who&#39;s symptoms go away when children are<br/>\ngiven a minimal amount of attention or when children have something<br/>\ninteresting to do. This is agreed upon by all observers (Breggin 1984)<br/>\nand even finds its way into the DSM III-R, which specifies that the<br/>\nsymptoms may not be apparent while a child is playing a video game, in a<br/>\nnovel setting or being examined by a doctor. And yet despite the<br/>\ndisappearance of symptomatology during examination, psychiatrists still<br/>\nclaim they have scientific validity for ADHD. ADHD did not come into<br/>\nexistence by scientific means, and it does not serve any medical purpose<br/>\nfor the patient. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder was literally<br/>\nvoted into existence in 1987 by a committee of the American Psychiatric<br/>\nAssociation. Thus by a show of hands, a new disease had entered as a<br/>\nmedically-valid disorder into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of<br/>\nMental Disorders. Understanding the purpose that inventing a disease<br/>\nserves can be determined by examining the results that it created. In<br/>\n1952 the first DSM was published by the APA, listing 112 maladies. The<br/>\n1994 edition lists more than 370 different mental disorders. A new<br/>\ncategory was created for the DSM II, published in 1968, entitled<br/>\n&quot;Behavior Disorders of Childhood and Adolescence.&quot; In 1975 the<br/>\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act was passed, providing<br/>\nspecial education classes and state and federal funding for students<br/>\nwith &quot;learning disabilities.&quot; There were only 782,000 children with<br/>\nlearning disabilities in 1977. In 1989 there were 1.9 million children<br/>\ndiagnosed with learning disorders, and in 1996 there were 2.6 million<br/>\nwith this affliction. And were these diagnoses scientific? According to<br/>\nKevin P. Dwyer, assistant director of the National Association of School<br/>\nPsychologists in the U.S., the diagnosis of learning disorders is &quot;not a<br/>\nscience.&quot; He added, &quot;we&#39;re not sophisticated enough to do a perfect<br/>\ndiagnosis.&quot; After the invention of ADHD in 1987, there were 500,000<br/>\nchildren already diagnosed with it a year later. In 1990 federal<br/>\nlegislation created welfare programs for low-income parents to receive<br/>\n$450 per month for each child diagnosed with ADHD. Parents would<br/>\nintentionally coach their children to behave in a manner to receive the<br/>\ndiagnosis. In 1991 federal education grants gave $400 a year to schools<br/>\nfor each child with an ADHD diagnosis. The U.S. Department of Education<br/>\nrecognized ADHD to be a handicap and directed all state education<br/>\nofficers to establish procedures to identify and screen children with<br/>\nADHD and to give them educational and psychological services. According<br/>\nto Baughman, the frequency with which ADHD and LD are diagnosed in<br/>\nschools is &quot;proportional to the presence and influence within the<br/>\nschools of mind-brain behavioral diagnosticians, testers and<br/>\ntherapists.&quot; Schools today in the U.S. spend more than one billion<br/>\ndollars a year combined on psychologists and psychiatrists working<br/>\nfull-time to diagnose students. In 1996 15 billion dollars was spent on<br/>\nthe diagnosis, treatment and study of these learning disorders. In 1998<br/>\nBritish Columbia Health Minister Ms. Penny Priddi, asked the college of<br/>\nphysicians and surgeons to find out why the number of children diagnosed<br/>\nwith ADHD had tripled since 1992. &quot;I&#39;m trying to picture what I would do<br/>\nif the school said about this child that I adore, &#39;either you put him on<br/>\nthis drug or he can&#39;t come back.&#39; It feels a bit like blackmail,&quot; she<br/>\nsaid. Penny was referring to schools forcing children to take Ritalin at<br/>\nthe risk of expulsion. This problem was not limited to Canada. In 1991 a<br/>\nU.S. District Court ruled that state and local educational officials<br/>\nviolated a student&#39;s rights by insisting he take Ritalin to attend<br/>\nmainstream classes. In his book Prescription for Disaster, Thomas Moore<br/>\nsaid that Ritalin is given &quot;for short-term control of human behavior,<br/>\nnot to reduce any identifiable hazards to children&#39;s health. Such<br/>\nlong-scale chemical control of human behavior has not previously been<br/>\nundertaken in our society outside of nursing homes and mental<br/>\ninstitutions.&quot; Schools and psychiatrists are obviously placing these<br/>\nchildren on the drugs for their own financial incentive. If the<br/>\nstimulants truly were beneficial to the child, then school performance<br/>\nwould improve. This is not the case. At least five different scientific<br/>\nstudies indicate that no improvement in academic learning occurs from<br/>\nthese drugs, and stimulants can actually impair cognitive processes and<br/>\nacademic competence, making a child more docile and compliant (Wiseman<br/>\n1995). Canadian psychologist Tana Dineen says in her book Manufacturing<br/>\nVictims that &quot;psychology is neither a science nor a profession, but an<br/>\nindustry that turns healthy people into victims to give itself a<br/>\nconstant source of income.&quot; Professors Herb Kutchins and Stuart A. Kirk<br/>\nof Scientific American describe the DSM as &quot;primarily about being a<br/>\nguide to filling out insurance forms.&quot; Jeffry A. Schaler, adjunct<br/>\nprofessor from Philadelphia also warns legislators and the general<br/>\npublic to &quot;not be hoodwinked&quot; by psychiatry&#39;s labels and diagnoses.<br/>\nDespite the lack of proof that ADHD exists as a legitimate medical<br/>\ndisease with a characteristic pattern of recurring symptoms that can be<br/>\nidentified, measured and treated, numerous literature exists to support<br/>\nits advocates and their claims. Much of this literature originates from<br/>\nan organization called CHADD, Children and Adults with Attention Deficit<br/>\nDisorder, a group of parents who have kids with ADD and ADHD. CHADD&#39;s<br/>\nofficial policy views children with ADD as suffering from genetic and<br/>\nbiological problems. According to CHADD president Sandra F. Thomas, &quot;Our<br/>\nkids have a neurological impairment that is pervasive and affects every<br/>\narea of their life, day and night.&quot; CHADD believes that emotional upset<br/>\nand anger at children with ADHD is in no way caused by families, parents<br/>\nor schools, but is entirely the fault of the child. This was illustrated<br/>\nby a brochure which stated that &quot;Frustrated, upset and anxious parents<br/>\ndo not cause children to have ADD, on the contrary, ADD children usually<br/>\ncause their parents to be frustrated, upset and anxious.&quot; The reason for<br/>\nCHADD&#39;s decision to blame the victim rather than the culprit in the<br/>\ntypical psychiatrist&#39;s fashion became clear when it was discovered that<br/>\nCHADD has joined forces with biologically-oriented psychiatrists, many<br/>\nof whom sit on the advisory board. The most devastating enditement to<br/>\nCHADD, however, is the receipt of large contributions to enable<br/>\nhigh-pressure lobbying, media campaigns and up-scale national<br/>\nconventions from Ciba-Geigy, leading manufacturer for the leading ADD<br/>\ndrug, Ritalin.<br/>\nIf there is no biologic basis for ADHD, then something else must be<br/>\ncreating the symptoms. There must be an even darker force at work than<br/>\ngenetic make-up or chemicals or physical defects to explain the increase<br/>\nin inattentive, impulsive and hyperactive behavior. That darker force is<br/>\na psychologically-based educational system, collectively known as<br/>\noutcome-based education. Advocated in the United States by psychologist<br/>\nDr. William Coulson and implemented throughout the world, outcome-based<br/>\neducation consists of programs that have replaced standard academic<br/>\ncurricula. These include whole language (invented by psychologist James<br/>\nCattell) to replace phonics-based reading, new math, invented spelling<br/>\nand values clarification classes. The purpose of these programs along<br/>\nwith the goals of world psychiatry were expressed by Dr. G. Brock<br/>\nChisholm, Co-founder for the World Federation of Mental Health in 1945:<br/>\n&quot;The re-interpretation and eventually irradication of the concept of<br/>\nright and wrong which has been the basis of child training, the<br/>\nsubstitution of intelligence and rational thinking for faith, are the<br/>\nbelated objectives of practically all psychotherapy. With the other<br/>\nhuman sciences, psychiatry must now decide what is to be the immediate<br/>\nfuture of the human race. No one else can.&quot; In outcome-based education,<br/>\nthe focus rests on trying to bring about certain outcomes from the child<br/>\nby modifying his behavior and altering his beliefs. This is very similar<br/>\nto the materialistic stimulus-response philosophies on which psychiatry<br/>\nwas founded. Author William Kilpatrick explains that &quot;feelings, personal<br/>\ngrowth and a total nonjudgmental attitude&quot; are emphasized and &quot;no time<br/>\nis spent providing moral guidance or forming character. The virtues are<br/>\nnot explained or discussed, nor models of good behavior are provided. No<br/>\nreason is given why a boy or girl should want to be good in the first<br/>\nplace. They come away with the impression that even the most basic<br/>\nvalues are matters of dispute.&quot; As a result of OBE being firmly in place<br/>\nby 1987 in the state of Arkansas by Governor Bill Clinton, homicide<br/>\nrates by 14-17-year-olds increased by 435 percent, surpassing the number<br/>\nfor the same age group in the entire country by 1990. Between 1989 and<br/>\n1995, arrests of minors in Arkansas increased by 180 percent. The<br/>\nauthors of the text for values clarification state: &quot;It is entirely<br/>\npossible that children will choose not to develop values. It is the<br/>\nteacher&#39;s responsibility to support this choice also.&quot; As Chisholm<br/>\nstated, values clarification has the objective of clarifying and<br/>\nredefining the meanings of right and wrong so that there are no<br/>\nobjective moral values, only personal opinion. Another aspect of<br/>\noutcome-based education is the whole language method developed by<br/>\npsychologist James Cattell. Whole language replaces phonics-based<br/>\nmethods by forcing the child to learn words by memorizing the<br/>\narrangement of the letters rather than learning their correlation or<br/>\nsignificance. The state of California replaced their phonics-based<br/>\nprograms with whole language in 1987. As a result, in 1992 California<br/>\nfourth graders tied for last place on the National Assessment of<br/>\nEducation Program tests, and in 1994 California came in last place, with<br/>\n86% scoring below proficient levels (Baughman 1996). Dr. Baughman has<br/>\nnoted a correlation between learning disabilities and illiteracy, noting<br/>\nno physical abnormality and noting that competency improves with<br/>\nphonics-based training. Many other parents who have put their child<br/>\nthrough phonics-based programs because the child was unable to read<br/>\nafter having gone through school have also noted significant<br/>\nimprovements in school performance. President Bill Clinton has enacted<br/>\nlegislation granting federal funds to state and local schools for<br/>\nimplementation of outcome-based education programs in the entire<br/>\ncountry. The &quot;Goals 2000&quot; program was designed to further advance the<br/>\ninfluence of psychiatry in society, requiring all schools to implement<br/>\nOBE programs in order to receive federal grants. The program also<br/>\nestablishes the creation of mini-psychiatric clinics in every public<br/>\nschool in the nation by the year 2000. Acting legislation at that time<br/>\nwill allow a psychiatrist to place any child in the school on<br/>\npsychiatric drugs without parental consent. Author Beverly Eakman<br/>\ndescribes the educational situation today as follows: &quot;Most people today<br/>\nsuspect that education is not really about literacy basics or<br/>\nproficiency in anything. What is less well-understood is that there<br/>\nexists in this country and indeed throughout the industrialized world<br/>\nwhat can best be described as an illiteracy cartel, ostensibly aimed at<br/>\nfurthering mental power. This cartel derives its power from those who<br/>\nstand to benefit financially and politically from ignorance and<br/>\neducational malpractice, from the frustration, the crime, the<br/>\njoblessness and social chaos that miseducation produces.&quot; ADHD ? a<br/>\ncomplete contrivance of the APA with no scientific validity. While<br/>\npsychiatrists will argue that there is scientific evidence or that there<br/>\nare scientific studies that support the existence or validity of ADHD,<br/>\nthe dictionary defines scientific as &quot;systematic, accurate, exact.&quot;<br/>\nThese words have nothing to do with the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD,<br/>\nor with psychiatry, for that matter. There is not one laboratory test or<br/>\nclinical finding that has been established as diagnostic for<br/>\nidentification and treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity<br/>\nDisorder. This contrivance invented by the American Psychiatric<br/>\nAssociation purely has the motives of capitalizing off of the sale of<br/>\npowerful, addictive and potentially dangerous psychotropic drugs. And as<br/>\nfurther demonstrated, the psychiatrist is also involved in the creation<br/>\nof many of the symptoms of ADHD by pushing his drugs into society and<br/>\nimplementing his behavior-altering, nonacademic education programs.<br/>\nAccording to psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, &quot;Thrusting fake intimacy and<br/>\npretended care on them (children) as professional child-enslavers do is<br/>\nour distinctively modern method of harming children in the name of<br/>\nhelping them. The child psychiatrist&#39;s authority is altogether beyond<br/>\nthe reach of his denominated patients. This elementary fact makes the<br/>\nchild psychiatrist one of the most dangerous enemies, not only of<br/>\nchildren but also of adults who care for the two most precious and<br/>\nvulnerable things in life, children and liberty. Child psychology and<br/>\nchild psychiatry cannot be reformed; they must be abolished.&quot; And who<br/>\nare these &quot;experts&quot; who pontificate on TV about behavior, the mind and<br/>\nthe various social problems of the day, advising millions? Psychiatrists<br/>\nare criminally charged disproportionately more than any other section of<br/>\nthe health care industry. At least ten percent of psychiatrists,<br/>\npsychologists and psychotherapists admit to sexually abusing their<br/>\npatients, according to one of their own studies. Psychiatrists top the<br/>\nlist of medical doctors least likely to sustain a successful marriage,<br/>\nand the suicide rate for psychiatrists is twice that of other<br/>\nphysicians. Psychology Today reported that psychologists and other<br/>\nmental health professionals are more insane than the rest of the<br/>\npopulation. Dr. Michael Chavin, M.D. does offer us some words of<br/>\nencouragement, however: &quot;I thought I had seen psychiatry at its worst<br/>\nwith its fixation on barbaric practices such as electroshock treatment.<br/>\nI was wrong. Nothing compares to the viciously covert mental and<br/>\nphysical abuse that is dealt innocent children through psychiatric<br/>\ndrugging and psychology-based curricula today. Parents have the right,<br/>\nthe responsibility and all the power they need to reverse this hideous<br/>\nsituation, and they must, for who else can our children turn to?&quot; It<br/>\nbecomes clear, then, that it is up to the parents and those who care<br/>\nabout children to insure that they receive sound educational and medical<br/>\nattention. It becomes clear that a child manifesting behavioral problems<br/>\nshould receive quality treatment that does not involve treating an<br/>\nabnormality in the brain that has never been discovered or can never be<br/>\ntested for. The 1986 book Ill, Not Insane lists 140 medical problems<br/>\nthat can cause mental and emotional trouble including suboptimum<br/>\nnutrition, exposure to antinutrients, overuse of sugar, stimulants and<br/>\ndepressants and food allergies or intolerances. It becomes clear that<br/>\nother factors must be examined to determine the true cause of the<br/>\nbehavior. The educational curriculum must be examined to insure it is<br/>\nacademically-centered. Finding the real cause of a child&#39;s inattention,<br/>\nimpulsivity and hyperactivity and addressing that cause will lead to a<br/>\nchild that pays attention, behaves and does well in school because he<br/>\nwants to, not because a drug forces him to do so.

I have an ADD child and two that are not and a fourth  who is to<br/>\nyoung to know, Putting my daughter on meds does not in any way inhibit who<br/>\nshe is or her creativity!  infact she has been spending a significant amount<br/>\nof time drawing dolphins which happen to be her passion, something she had<br/>\nno patience for without meds, My daughter was one who when she was in<br/>\nschool, took her meds and also participated in the DARE program of which she<br/>\nwas a proud member of, and I don&#39;t for one second  appreciate the<br/>\ninsinuation that just because she has to take medication she shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nparticipate in the dare program, and is this supposed to mean that you<br/>\nassume she must be a drug addict? and I do not for a second put my child on<br/>\nmeds so that I don&#39;t have to spend any time with her, infact just the<br/>\nopposite, without it she is not emotionally functional enough to be civil to<br/>\nanyone and just flat out beligerant about everything, with it she goes back<br/>\nto the wonderful loving child I have always known her to be!  there was a<br/>\nstatement made about the parents of these kids being compared to people who<br/>\nlet their children bounce around the car,  most of the severe add children I<br/>\nknow wouldn&#39;t be able to be restrained without meds, some of these kids ( a<br/>\ngreat deal of the severe cases) can&#39;t keep these kids in anything, beds ,<br/>\ncribs, carseats ect...... and it comes as a great releif for the parents of<br/>\nthese children to be able to have things like restraints finally work!  you<br/>\npeople who think you know so much about other peoples children and the life<br/>\nthey must live have no clue how deep the love runs for  these children and<br/>\nhow far the parents would go to protect them and help them whatever it took!<br/>\nso before you go accusing these parents of just being lazy or bad parents<br/>\nmaybe you should take a good  hard long look at what they go thru every day<br/>\nof their lives  and be thankful for  the fact that you don&#39;t have to<br/>\nexperience  what we do everyday , and that you don&#39;t have to spend every<br/>\nwaking moment  dealing with and protecting them from the  kind of ignorance<br/>\nthat  is out there with regards to ADD ~!!!!!!!!<br/>\nTanya Ohio  (who wished they had diagnosed my ADD  during my school years!)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;A friend of mine who teaches tells me the most<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;bizarre thing she sees happening is kids being rushed to get on line to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>get<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;their &quot;meds&quot; so they can get back to class in time for their DARE program.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Huh???<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Maura&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;What parent could, in good conscious, medicate their child daily like<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How can we know what the long term effects of such action will be?

I agree that this happens far too often for the <br/>\nconvenience of the schools.  i have a busy kid and i&#39;ve already had a <br/>\ntaste of this recently.  We were at the park and a gal who had been <br/>\noff in the distance watching my 3 yo son play with her 5 yo son came <br/>\nover and struck up a conversation with me.  they were having fun and <br/>\ngetting along but she had been closely watching his behavior - or <br/>\nshould i say &quot;energy level&quot;.  turns out she works at the &quot;Head Start&quot; <br/>\nschool and was suggesting that i should look into getting Sterling <br/>\nenrolled.  we were on the subject of how advanced he is and she <br/>\nproceeded to tell me about how they have &quot;free testing&quot; 3 times a year so <br/>\nyou can find out where your child is at even if you don&#39;t plan on <br/>\nenrolling them into the school.  i took it as being more of <br/>\na skills and academic test combined with developmental skills so that <br/>\nthey know how to place them with other kids of the same level.  well, <br/>\njust for kicks, i decided to look into it further for the testing <br/>\neven though i had no plans to enroll him.  funny...  they test in <br/>\nNovember?  h-m-m-m.  so what is covered in this testing i ask!  and i <br/>\nquote &quot;Oh, we are looking for any deficits or learning disorders the <br/>\nchild might have!&quot;  URGH!!!!  so this &quot;teacher&quot; who is not qualified <br/>\nto make this sort of diagnosis had concluded in 15 minutes of <br/>\nwatching Sterling on the playground that he needed to be tested for a <br/>\nlearning disorder??  she obviously concluded ADD just because of his <br/>\nspontanity and energy level!  NO THANK YOU!  <br/>\n<br/>\ni hope this helps with the other side of the picture and why some of <br/>\nus go bonkers over the idea of &quot;busy kids&quot; being diagnosed as ADD and <br/>\nbeing drugged into submission for the convenience of the schools.  <br/>\nand yes i do agree that some kids truly are ADD and can benefit <br/>\ngreatly from the proper treatment whether it be Ritalin or some other <br/>\nalternative method that works and that is appropriate for the degree of <br/>\nthe ADD.<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;d love to respond to more of your message but it is LATE and i need <br/>\nsome sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nMichele Moss<br/>\nMom of Sterling Tyler age 3 yrs old<br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Resource Web site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.icstech.net/~michele\">http://www.icstech.net/~michele</a><br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Discussion Group:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/list/psk\">http://www.egroups.com/list/psk</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Maura Seger","from":"&quot;Maura Seger&quot; &lt;mseger@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ttGhFCDpZMWJ4_KxCrBWee0hMJEhnc9h6qHR9SYgmzq__sxzbm7tDhlxBWbZnVNX8_fmnfmkdxdLEch7l0-lezECtgunj-MWpTz9OQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: Fw: ADD/Custody Issue","postDate":"933884263","msgId":1722,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xMzcuMTcyMi45NTkyNjk3NDBAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":1721,"nextInTopic":1736,"prevInTime":1721,"nextInTime":1723,"topicId":1689,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
