We have only been h/s unschooling for 8 months<br/>\n&gt;and like your son, she is very unmotivated.  She is very anti<br/>\n&gt;anything that smells of school.  And like you I was getting very<br/>\n&gt;frustrated.<br/>\n&gt;I have a friend who will climb into bed with her son when she isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;talking to her husband, and he is 18yrs old!!!!!<br/>\n&gt;I think it is pretty cool that yoou have such a close relationship<br/>\n&gt;with your son.<br/>\n&gt;My dd used to climb in bed with me almost every night when my husband<br/>\n&gt;worked away.<br/>\n&gt;marianne<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks Marianne :-<br/>\nI am feeling better by the minute as I read these wonderful responses. Thank <br/>\nyou for your support!<br/>\n-C<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;TV and video games can really motivate people you know.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I did not know this, thank you! ;-)<br/>\nI know of so many<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;boys whose parents worried about lack of motivation but their dedication to<br/>\n&gt;their children&#39;s autonomy meant that they didn&#39;t try to interfere.  They<br/>\n&gt;still made suggestions, invitations, and were available, but didn&#39;t stop<br/>\n&gt;what was going on in the children&#39;s heads.  I have seen games turn into so<br/>\n&gt;much creativity.  Whole civiisations being created, trading cards beign<br/>\n&gt;designed, enactments of videos,  and I have seen what appeared to be just<br/>\n&gt;plain laziness.  My opinion is that it is okay.  Once anybody finds<br/>\n&gt;something which motivates them, they are on it, they do it. Kids don&#39;t need<br/>\n&gt;to practice anything by doing stuff that is boring or that they hate, just<br/>\n&gt;so they will be ready later in life to do what they want to do .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you realize your own goals, that is the best lesson<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;that you children can learn.  If they see you doing something you want to <br/>\n&gt;do, making it happen, then they will learn that when it is thier turn, they <br/>\n&gt;can do the same, and you will be there to help them.<br/>\n&gt;Very good, Julie, again, another excellent point. I think I let myself get <br/>\n&gt;too worked up and worried when things aren&#39;t going the way I think they are <br/>\n&gt;&quot;supposed to.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Did you ever have a family bed with your 11-year-old or any of your other<br/>\n&gt;children? &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This one is from Amy, right? :-)<br/>\nNo, we&#39;ve never had a family bed, even though the boys and I would have <br/>\npreferred it. dh didn&#39;t particularly care for the idea :-( Don&#39;t like to <br/>\nadmit it, but...<br/>\nThe boys shared their room until about a year ago. Oldest ds asked for it. I <br/>\nstill slept with him when they shared, too. We recently got a bigger bed for <br/>\nthe youngest now, so I could sleep with him, too! :-)<br/>\nThanks so much for everyone&#39;s help! I can&#39;t tell you how much all of this <br/>\nmeans!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15139,"nextTopicId":15147}}
