It is a  <br/>\n&gt; freely distributed program for such tasks as photo retouching,  <br/>\n&gt; image composition and image authoring.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It has many capabilities. It can be used as a simple paint program,  <br/>\n&gt; an expert quality photo retouching program, an online batch  <br/>\n&gt; processing system, a mass production image renderer, an image  <br/>\n&gt; format converter, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GIMP is expandable and extensible. It is designed to be augmented  <br/>\n&gt; with plug-ins and extensions to do just about anything. The  <br/>\n&gt; advanced scripting interface allows everything from the simplest  <br/>\n&gt; task to the most complex image manipulation procedures to be easily  <br/>\n&gt; scripted.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GIMP is written and developed under X11 on UNIX platforms.
