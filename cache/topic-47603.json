Here&#39;s mine: I&#39;m ingrid (40), live with my French partner (44) and three children (ds 17yo, ds 5.5yo and dd 17 months) on an island in British Columbia, Canada. WE are a trilingual/multicultural family (French, German, English). My younger son was just offically registered this year for the first time as a &quot;homeschooler&quot; --i&#39;m grateful for the freedom in this province which means no testing, evalutions or interference whatsoever. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe oldest has been unschooled much of his life but also private schooled, alternative schooled and has presently decided to quit public highschool after quasi-attending for a couple of years. Concerns i had regarding him are the reason that prompted me to find this list--i may post about that soon.  But as I read today I realise just how incredibly deep are my needs for like-minded folks--not just people who love and accept me as I am (which I have plenty of) but folks who *really* share my deepest principles and convictions about parenting and life and who will challenge and learn with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nRespectful parenting and interpersonal communication are my passions. I&#39;ve been studying these since childhood and used to know a lot about them :-). Almost daily i am discovering how little I truly know, how often i screw up (and my teen confirms this :-)), how much parenting is really mostly about *me* growing, how much i still want to learn about practising respect and compassion. I&#39;m excited about that journey!<br/>\n<br/>\nThough I find myself having less and less to write these days too, language and writing are my medium. I work at home as a freelance writer and have written and self-published a book on Natural Infant Hygiene (or Elimination Communication--both phrases I coined to refer to an age-old concept) about tuning in to and meeting an infant&#39;s elimination needs without relying on diapers. (I have a website at www.natural-wisdom.com ) My dh works at home too, mostly outdoors.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m presently enthusiastically studying and trying to put into practice the work of Marshall Rosenberg on Compassionate Communication (anybody here familiar with it? www.nonviolentcommunication.com ) Other family interests include anything to do with nature and our &quot;natural&quot; way of being, raw paleolithic nutrition (after 16 years as a vegetarian and 2 years as a raw vegan, wow! talk about a major paradigm shift!), reading, skateboarding, gardening, natural animal husbandry, engaged spirituality, acrobatics, travel, community, sustainable living, music (from early music and classical to hip-hop and dj&#39;ing), taking things out of boixes and putting them back in, mountain horse-trekking, and more!<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to taking part here.<br/>\nwarmly,<br/>\ningrid<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122754549,"authorName":"Mike Ebbers","from":"&quot;Mike Ebbers&quot; &lt;mikeebb@...&gt;","profile":"mikeebb","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: I&#39;m a yeller","postDate":"1035488812","msgId":47777,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFwOWluYys2YzdjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFhYS5hZDMxZTc5LjJhZTk5Mzk0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47758,"nextInTopic":47788,"prevInTime":47776,"nextInTime":47778,"topicId":47603,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;m more than willing to take that <br/>\nheat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is: <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one of the three places in the world (and for a brief few days, there <br/>\nwas a fourth, the conference) where the unschooling utopia IS. There actually <br/>\nis a lot of tolerance and a lot of generosity and a lot of patience here. I&#39;d <br/>\nsay more than anywhere else that&#39;s group-related. Our homes are/can be that <br/>\ntolerant and generous and patient on a daily basis. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is not a group anywhere, in my opinion, that is more willing to offer <br/>\nhelp and suggestions and a path to gentle parenting and unschooling. And <br/>\n&#39;though a few may disagree, the main posters/lurkers on this list truly <br/>\nbelieve that unschooling is a LIFESTYLE (not yelling, just emphasizing! &lt;g&gt;), <br/>\nNOT just an educational choice. Because, here, LIFE is educational. How can a <br/>\nchild REALLY understand that HIS choices are the right choices if his choices <br/>\nare constantly limited? How can HE show respect until he receives respect? <br/>\nHow can HE decide what to believe if it&#39;s all laid out in black and white <br/>\n(and red) in front of him? Unschooling---the lifestyle---is understanding <br/>\nthat our choices define Who We Really Are. Educationally and Personally. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut when folks come in---brand spanking &lt;g&gt; new to the group---and start <br/>\ninsisting that a parent&#39;s right outweighs that of a child, that choices <br/>\nshould be limited, that spanking&#39;s ok because it&#39;s legal, that politics <br/>\nshould enter every conversation, or that Christianity is the ONLY way,  then <br/>\nthey&#39;re stepping on too many toes. We&#39;ll try for a few dozen posts to get our <br/>\npoint (and the point of this LIST) across; but after that, if the newbie <br/>\nwon&#39;t let it rest, it can, and occasionally does, come to verbal blows.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are countless people that have changed their parenting style by reading <br/>\nhere daily (me included) because the regulars here gently and respectfully <br/>\nguide and suggest and openly discuss their ideas, roadblocks, and successes. <br/>\nWe are incredibly tolerant (some more than others &lt;g&gt;) of questions and <br/>\nchallenges from newbies. But I&#39;d say few, if any, of us are tolerant of <br/>\nbelittling children or arguing for the sake of arguing. Maybe belittling <br/>\nchildren and arguing are common in the homes of newbies, so they don&#39;t see it <br/>\nas offensive. HERE, though, it comes across as inconsiderate and totally <br/>\ndisrepectful of the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I apologize for any inconsiderate remarks I made. I hope that one day the <br/>\nnewbies will (after stepping back, quietly reading, and digesting what they <br/>\nread) come to see the possibilities that this list tries to provide without <br/>\narguing every point.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122754549,"authorName":"Mike Ebbers","from":"&quot;Mike Ebbers&quot; &lt;mikeebb@...&gt;","profile":"mikeebb","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: I&#39;m a yeller","postDate":"1035452104","msgId":47678,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFwOGVzOCtoYm8zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0LmIyZWVkZi4yYWU4ODViMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47603,"nextInTopic":47758,"prevInTime":47677,"nextInTime":47679,"topicId":47603,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That s great to hear.
