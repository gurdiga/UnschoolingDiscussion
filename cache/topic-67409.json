Just liked this line of questioning.my two cents - <br/>\n <br/>\nReward systems are good for certain children and only at certain<br/>\nsituations. In particular - if a child seems to be a little<br/>\ndisinterested in accomplishing a behavior - biting fingernails for<br/>\nexample.the reward system might work because it serves to correct a<br/>\nspecific behavior and will only last until the modifications are<br/>\ncompleted. Once the child&#39;s habit in this instance is broken, one would<br/>\nnot continue to reward the corrected behavior. <br/>\n <br/>\nReward systems in this instance are going to fail. Why? Because they<br/>\nwill only last until the newness wears off or the reward no longer<br/>\njustifies the act of the required behavior. What does the teacher plan<br/>\non using once the coin is no longer enough incentive to behave? 2 coins?<br/>\n3 coins? <br/>\n <br/>\nIf the teacher truly wanted to elicit better behavior, then usually a<br/>\nhigher set of standards with positive reinforcement is required. If a<br/>\nchild wiggles during a service, work together to see what can challenge<br/>\nthe child until service is over.have him count hats, flowers, sneezes,<br/>\nor the number of times the word &quot;Amen&quot; is spoken - that one tricks many<br/>\ninto paying attention (grin). <br/>\n <br/>\nMany creative and unusual techniques can be adapted to fit different<br/>\nsituations. Reward systems are good for specific instances with short<br/>\nterm goals and quick achievements. Long term goals, like character<br/>\ndevelopment take different approaches. I have discovered that other<br/>\nchildren monitoring good behavior in their peers is *very* influencing.<br/>\nMaybe the teacher could give the children lots of tickets or coins and<br/>\ntell them they must try to notice positive behavior in their peers and<br/>\nwhen they do, give them a coin. The goal is to give your coins away as<br/>\nwell as earn them from your peers. No reward system for the most coins<br/>\nis necessary - we&#39;ve turned it into a game now. Again, this is not a<br/>\nlong term technique but a short term attention getter. Many of these<br/>\ntype games can be started back up every so often when the situation<br/>\ncalls for it.<br/>\n <br/>\nWell - I chatted on longer than I planned!

As I touched on briefly our church Sunday school is doing<br/>\nthis reward thing - and the &quot;RULES&quot; are explicit.

One child asked towards the cleanup time if he could do<br/>\nanything to help. I was pleasantly surprised and said &quot;sure&quot;. He<br/>\nproceeded to sweep all under where we were working ( we made salt dough<br/>\nmaps).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following night the boys were fighting over who was going to do<br/>\nthis. and then I overhear why ... apparently they are given &quot;coins&quot; by<br/>\nthe Sunday School teacher when they do helpful things, etc. These coins<br/>\ncan then be turned into prizes like matchbox cars, trinkets and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my  kids personally I really would like them to do helpful things<br/>\nfor the intrinsic value of being helpful, kind etc. NOT because they<br/>\nwill get a reward. However in real life - it does seem to work this way.<br/>\nIf you do a good job you get a raise. ( or in my husbands case - get to<br/>\nkeep your job;-) <br/>\n<br/>\nSo these same boys who would not normally have offered to help, much<br/>\nless done a decent clean-up job - now are more than willing to pitch in<br/>\nwhen given a reward.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t completely explain why - but I don&#39;t like this system. The other<br/>\nparents are fine with it - or don&#39;t want to rock the boat.  Some of them<br/>\neven go so far as to say they will &quot;call the Sunday School teacher if<br/>\nthe child is &quot;bad&quot; - and then a &quot;coin&quot; will be taken away. The Sunday<br/>\nSchool teacher seems to feel that the kids don&#39;t have a problem with it<br/>\n- but I do. Which I do. I feel as if teaching children in this way -<br/>\ngives them the belief system that &quot;one good deed gets a reward&quot; What if<br/>\nthere is no reward? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think we all are motivated by &quot;rewards&quot; of one type or another. It may<br/>\nnot be monetary - but emotional. So even if I just say to the child<br/>\n&quot;Thanks for doing such a great job sweeping up. It really helped me<br/>\nout!&quot; I have &quot;rewarded&quot; him in a sense. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do have one child in this class - and luckily he is either too small<br/>\nto care - or in my opinion is not developmentally ready for most of the<br/>\ncoin behavior. (i.e. Sitting in the seat throughout the whole meeting;<br/>\nno disobeying parents or adults; no running or rough playing; - and<br/>\nothers which I can&#39;t remember) We always have to go to the bathroom -<br/>\neven if we&#39;ve gone before. It&#39;s virtually impossible to sit in a<br/>\nstraight backed chair the whole time,  there is always something that is<br/>\nseen as disobeying - and in his exuberance - sometimes forgets not to<br/>\nrun and hop in the building. At times he does feel excited that he has a<br/>\n&quot;coin&quot;. And after I had it out with the teacher that the one coin that<br/>\nhe had was taken away because he &quot;saw him disobey me&quot; the coins are no<br/>\nlonger taken away once received.  And my son seems to really enjoy this<br/>\nclass. Chase doesn&#39;t have a problem with it - its me who feels it is a<br/>\nbit over the top. So is it wrong to interfere? ( Chase is 5)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you all think? In one sense the reward system appears to be<br/>\nworking.... but is it right to instill stewardship within a person based<br/>\nupon what reward they will receive?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your input.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:treegoddess@...\">treegoddess@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, April 21, 2003 9:25 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Praise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have lots of friends that give stickers, candy, trinkets as <br/>\n  rewards/praise for their toilet trainees to use the bathroom.

He proceeded to sweep all under where we were working ( we made salt dough maps).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following night the boys were fighting over who was going to do this. and then I overhear why ... apparently they are given &quot;coins&quot; by the Sunday School teacher when they do helpful things, etc. These coins can then be turned into prizes like matchbox cars, trinkets and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my  kids personally I really would like them to do helpful things for the intrinsic value of being helpful, kind etc. NOT because they will get a reward. However in real life - it does seem to work this way. If you do a good job you get a raise. ( or in my husbands case - get to keep your job;-) <br/>\n<br/>\nSo these same boys who would not normally have offered to help, much less done a decent clean-up job - now are more than willing to pitch in when given a reward.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t completely explain why - but I don&#39;t like this system. The other parents are fine with it - or don&#39;t want to rock the boat.  Some of them even go so far as to say they will &quot;call the Sunday School teacher if the child is &quot;bad&quot; - and then a &quot;coin&quot; will be taken away. The Sunday School teacher seems to feel that the kids don&#39;t have a problem with it - but I do. Which I do. I feel as if teaching children in this way - gives them the belief system that &quot;one good deed gets a reward&quot; What if there is no reward? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think we all are motivated by &quot;rewards&quot; of one type or another. It may not be monetary - but emotional. So even if I just say to the child &quot;Thanks for doing such a great job sweeping up. It really helped me out!&quot; I have &quot;rewarded&quot; him in a sense. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do have one child in this class - and luckily he is either too small to care - or in my opinion is not developmentally ready for most of the coin behavior. (i.e. Sitting in the seat throughout the whole meeting; no disobeying parents or adults; no running or rough playing; - and others which I can&#39;t remember) We always have to go to the bathroom - even if we&#39;ve gone before. It&#39;s virtually impossible to sit in a straight backed chair the whole time,  there is always something that is seen as disobeying - and in his exuberance - sometimes forgets not to run and hop in the building. At times he does feel excited that he has a &quot;coin&quot;. And after I had it out with the teacher that the one coin that he had was taken away because he &quot;saw him disobey me&quot; the coins are no longer taken away once received.  And my son seems to really enjoy this class. Chase doesn&#39;t have a problem with it - its me who feels it is a bit over the top. So is it wrong to interfere? ( Chase is 5)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you all think? In one sense the reward system appears to be working.... but is it right to instill stewardship within a person based upon what reward they will receive?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your input.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:treegoddess@...\">treegoddess@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, April 21, 2003 9:25 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Praise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have lots of friends that give stickers, candy, trinkets as <br/>\n  rewards/praise for their toilet trainees to use the bathroom.  Some even <br/>\n  put sad faces on a calendar if the child didn&#39;t make it to the bathroom <br/>\n  and stuff like that.  I&#39;ve seen their kids get pretty upset and have a <br/>\n  fit when they didn&#39;t get goodies anymore, and I&#39;ve seen the poor things <br/>\n  have the wind knocked out of their sails with the sad face on the <br/>\n  calendar.  So sad.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My 2yo DD is potty training herself and when she uses the toilet and/or <br/>\n  wakes up with a dry bed we give wild applaud as her own personal <br/>\n  cheerleading squad.  Stuff like, &quot;Hooray!  You did it!  Go Fifi!  Go <br/>\n  Fifi!  You must be so proud of yourself!!&quot;  Happy smiles all around. <br/>\n  Her 4yo big brother is her biggest supporter.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I like to think that less is more, and I wasn&#39;t going to gift-give with <br/>\n  my children every time they pooped.  LOL  I can see how that could <br/>\n  backfire.  Our way may not be perfect, but it works for us.<br/>\n<br/>\n  TreeGoddess<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
