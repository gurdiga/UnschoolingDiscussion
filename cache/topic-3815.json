The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-895741147\">Hi Randy<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the list. You asked:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  How<br/>\n&gt; *does* one know if our children are developing and learning as they should?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It certainly is a question I have asked, and worried over. But after a while I<br/>\nrealised that there were other questions I had to answer first.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe number one thing, IMO, is to decide how you would like your child to develop<br/>\nand what you want your child to learn. That sounds obvious, but it wasn&#39;t to me.<br/>\nI took my 5yo out of school after 7 weeks, knowing it wasn&#39;t right for us, but<br/>\nfor years struggled with different ways to teach / get him to learn the same<br/>\nsort of things school taught - and worried as to whether he was &lt;developing and<br/>\nlearning as they should&gt;. Which, of course, meant that what I was reading  - and<br/>\nbelieving - about unschooling wasn&#39;t happening because I always had this agenda<br/>\nof having him &#39;develop and learn as he should&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been 13 1/2 years now. My son has a job and has left home and is doing<br/>\nfine. I have 3 more sons (16,12,9) and I still struggle with the &#39;shoulds&#39;, even<br/>\nthough my &#39;shoulds&#39; have changed. I still catch myself worrying about math,<br/>\nscience, writing, reading, even though I tried to banish them to the bottom of<br/>\nmy list a long time ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example. Reading. I have worried about it for years. #1 learned to read at 9<br/>\n1/2.  #2 learned at 8 1/2. I worried a lot, in spite of all the reading I had<br/>\ndone on this subject. #4 learned at 4. I thought I&#39;d come to terms with it. All<br/>\n3 of them learned pretty quickly once they started. They really do learn when<br/>\nthey&#39;re ready. I stopped worrying about the shoulds of development and learning.<br/>\nI thought. #3 finally learned to read just before he was 12. He still hates it.<br/>\nHe&#39;s still not reading as well as a 12 yo &#39;should&#39;. He doesn&#39;t want to read. He<br/>\nwon&#39;t read. I really wish I had never found out what he &#39;should&#39; be able to do.<br/>\nHe IS making progress, and that&#39;s what I &#39;should&#39; focus on.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if you think about it and decide that you want your kids to be &#39;average&#39; or<br/>\nbetter in ordinary old school subjects, and it is important for you to know,<br/>\nthen go get them tested. Then you&#39;ll know. But remember that once you know what<br/>\nthey &#39;should&#39; be able to do, and where they stand in relation to that standard,<br/>\nyour relationship is changed. Inevitably. Irrevocably.<br/>\n<br/>\n We feel that values/feeling states like responsibility, self-esteem, happiness,<br/>\nhonesty etc. are more important than traditional subjects like math, science<br/>\netc.  By testing, and gaining that knowledge we have damaged his self esteem,<br/>\nand our relationship. Not lots, I hope, but a little. Yes, I would like him to<br/>\nread better, but I already knew from observation that he was improving. And IMO<br/>\nany parent can see by observation if their child is learning. I believe that if<br/>\nthey are progressing, and are getting the encouragement they need then they are<br/>\ndeveloping and learning as they should. Why bother about what the average or<br/>\nnorm is? I feel I failed my son by testing his reading just because I gave in to<br/>\nconditioning and worried about whether he was developing and learning as he<br/>\n&#39;should&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am just saying that we were very concerned when we started this process<br/>\n&gt; several years ago about how we would know that our children would be able to<br/>\n&gt; compete in the next century with their peers from around the world.  So we<br/>\n&gt; educated ourselves about what *they* say our children ought to know.  And we<br/>\n&gt; have kept a close eye to make sure that our children are measuring up or<br/>\n&gt; exceeding these standards educationally.  This gives us a certain level of<br/>\n&gt; comfort we that we felt we needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A while back our then Minister of Education here in New Zealand made a statement<br/>\nabout ensuring that all children were up to average! I laughed at this, of<br/>\ncourse, but it did make me think. It seems like all of us want our children to<br/>\nbe average or better. That, of course, is an impossibility. So setting that<br/>\nexpectation, is setting at least some children up for failure. So I thought,<br/>\nwhat&#39;s the answer? The answer for me is to make sure that I put their self<br/>\nesteem and happiness before academic achievement. That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink it&#39;s important for them to learn to write, compute etc. It&#39;s just not the<br/>\nbe all and end all, and not even near the top of my list (except when I slip<br/>\nback into the old conditioning).<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this is so long - this subject has been / is one of my hardest battles<br/>\nwith myself!<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3883,"nextTopicId":3885}}
