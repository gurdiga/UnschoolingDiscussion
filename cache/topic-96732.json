I also<br/>\nsing songs and &quot;tickle&quot; their tummies and backs before sleep (this is really<br/>\njust running my fingers lightly over their skin to relax them--my 4yo in<br/>\nparticular loves this.) and talk to them about each of their days.<br/>\nSometimes I have to nurse the baby while I sing and talk, and other times,<br/>\nhe&#39;s already asleep and I can just lay down next to them (they take turns<br/>\nhaving me next to them each night, but I always stroke and cuddle each some<br/>\nbefore bed.)  I&#39;ve tried to read while nursing Evan, but he just sits up and<br/>\ngrabs the pages and my face, because he&#39;s tired and wants my full attention,<br/>\ntoo, so it works better to just turn off the lights, (or turn them down if<br/>\nthe girls want to play quietly) and then take him into our room to go to<br/>\nsleep.   Once I get him down, if they aren&#39;t sleeping and especially if I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t had a chance to read and sing to them yet, I will go and read to<br/>\nthem and sing.  If I&#39;ve already done that I&#39;ll go and ask them if they need<br/>\nwater or to go to the bathroom, and then I will cuddle them again before<br/>\ngoing off to read, knit, watch an adult-themed movie or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s frustrating is that they will often bicker and fuss as soon as I go<br/>\nto put Evan down, or after I&#39;ve got him down and spent time with them.<br/>\nWhether they are choosing to go to sleep or &quot;play quietly in their room&quot;<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to matter.  Inevitably, some ruckus starts up that requires my<br/>\nattention at the very least or wakes up Evan for the umpteenth time.  I do<br/>\nthink sharing a bed has been a big problem, because when Annie was still in<br/>\nher crib and Stella had her own bed, yet they shared a room, this wasn&#39;t so<br/>\nmuch a problem.  Annie tends to find ways to aggravate Stella (and<br/>\noccasionally it&#39;s the other way around.) And the last few nights of seperate<br/>\nbeds has really helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe video trick, that others have suggested too, is worth trying, though<br/>\noften what has happened is they have just finished watching a movie with me<br/>\nand are tired and ready to get in bed.  Still, they somehow get going again,<br/>\nand besides, part of my trouble is that *I* need quiet time, not  movies<br/>\nwith them.  I need time to think about the day and sort out the next.  I<br/>\nlike to knit and read uninterrupted.  I know they are little and it won&#39;t be<br/>\nlike this forever.  I have a 15 yo son and he eventually came to regulate<br/>\nhimself quite well and could be in another room for a few hours in the<br/>\nevening without me. (for that matter, he was just a mellow guy most of the<br/>\ntime anyway, and I didn&#39;t much mind him being in the same room with me!)<br/>\nHaving three little ones at once is so different from that.

A sound machine would really help with the noise issue, with that on in our room a band could play in the hall and it wouldn&#39;t wake us :)  I believe it is unrealistic to think two small children are going to be perfectly quite while you put a baby down to sleep.  I have found if I engage my kids in something fun then after that they are ready to play by themselves while I do something else.  It may seem to you like they don&#39;t care but my guess is they really just want more attention and are sensing the negative energy you have about it.  Kids can be little barometers of our stress and energy. So getting yourself to a better place should be a priority, IMO.

They say<br/>\n&gt; they understand that I need quiet in order for their baby brother to<br/>\nsettle<br/>\n&gt; down to sleep, but are screaming or jumping on the bed or calling me<br/>\n(loudly<br/>\n&gt; and repeatedly) within minutes--sometimes as soon as I lay down with the<br/>\n&gt; baby and he has just begun to nurse.  Often, he will have just drifted off<br/>\n&gt; when they start and it wakes him and he then wants to get up and get in on<br/>\n&gt; the action, whatever it is.  This frustrates me no end!  If I try to<br/>\nremind<br/>\n&gt; them that he is trying to sleep, I wake him up further.  If I just lay<br/>\nthere<br/>\n&gt; hoping they will stop soon, it escalates.  I usually have to say something<br/>\n&gt; and accept that I will be lying there awhile longer trying to get him to<br/>\n&gt; sleep--often doing this several times, and I often have to actually get up<br/>\n&gt; and go into their room and settle some difference and remind them to be<br/>\n&gt; quiet.  Many times, I wind up yelling at them, which I feel horrible<br/>\nabout.<br/>\n&gt; BUT THEY JUST WON&#39;T STOP.  I&#39;m not kidding!

I responded to this post, because no<br/>\n&gt; matter how I explain things to my children, they just don&#39;t seem to care<br/>\n&gt; really.  It doesn&#39;t do much to change the behavior at all.  Perhaps this<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; because of their age.   I know that eventually they will be more<br/>\n&gt; considerate, but right now, they really don&#39;t seem to give a rat&#39;s a**<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; I need quiet time, or the baby needs to sleep.  And it&#39;s not for lack of<br/>\n&gt; modeling.  I don&#39;t let the baby go in their rooms when they are sleeping<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; the morning, and when one of the tells me she needs time to herself, I<br/>\nmake<br/>\n&gt; sure she gets it. I respect their needs and attend to them.   I know they<br/>\n&gt; are young, but I keep hearing on this list about all these amazing young<br/>\n&gt; children who get it when you explain something to them.

They say<br/>\nthey understand that I need quiet in order for their baby brother to settle<br/>\ndown to sleep, but are screaming or jumping on the bed or calling me (loudly<br/>\nand repeatedly) within minutes--sometimes as soon as I lay down with the<br/>\nbaby and he has just begun to nurse.  Often, he will have just drifted off<br/>\nwhen they start and it wakes him and he then wants to get up and get in on<br/>\nthe action, whatever it is.  This frustrates me no end!  If I try to remind<br/>\nthem that he is trying to sleep, I wake him up further.  If I just lay there<br/>\nhoping they will stop soon, it escalates.  I usually have to say something<br/>\nand accept that I will be lying there awhile longer trying to get him to<br/>\nsleep--often doing this several times, and I often have to actually get up<br/>\nand go into their room and settle some difference and remind them to be<br/>\nquiet.  Many times, I wind up yelling at them, which I feel horrible about.<br/>\nBUT THEY JUST WON&#39;T STOP.  I&#39;m not kidding! I&#39;m seriously at my wits end<br/>\nabout this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlas, as I said in my other post, I&#39;ve been trying to have them go to<br/>\nseperate rooms to sleep, and it has helped for the last couple of nights.<br/>\nHope it continues to go well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI kind of got off the topic, though.  I responded to this post, because no<br/>\nmatter how I explain things to my children, they just don&#39;t seem to care<br/>\nreally.  It doesn&#39;t do much to change the behavior at all.  Perhaps this is<br/>\nbecause of their age.   I know that eventually they will be more<br/>\nconsiderate, but right now, they really don&#39;t seem to give a rat&#39;s a** that<br/>\nI need quiet time, or the baby needs to sleep.  And it&#39;s not for lack of<br/>\nmodeling.  I don&#39;t let the baby go in their rooms when they are sleeping in<br/>\nthe morning, and when one of the tells me she needs time to herself, I make<br/>\nsure she gets it. I respect their needs and attend to them.   I know they<br/>\nare young, but I keep hearing on this list about all these amazing young<br/>\nchildren who get it when you explain something to them.  I admit, when I had<br/>\nonly one, she was like that, but now with 3...ugh...no way.  They wear me<br/>\ndown and ignore me, etc...  It&#39;s like I don&#39;t have a voice.  I&#39;m exhausted.<br/>\nI can&#39;t even explain how hard it gets around here.  I feel like a lame,<br/>\nineffectual, unimportant nobody.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Andrea<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sanguinegirl83@...\">Sanguinegirl83@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, July 27, 2004 1:29 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Change and grow<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 7/23/2004 9:26:54 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scubamama@...\">scubamama@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tactically, giving information is the post powerful way for the 3 y/o<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to learn, not comply, but learn how and why &quot;bugging&quot; her sibling is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disturbing.
