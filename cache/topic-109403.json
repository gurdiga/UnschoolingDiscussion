Much science is learned by touching, <br/>\nfeeling, exploring, finding things out on accident, etc...that is what <br/>\nmakes science fun. Look at George Washington Carver.  He didn&#39;t know <br/>\nhow to read or write as a child but his curiousity had him doing <br/>\nexperiments with nature long before he stepped foot into a school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you not willing to do science experiments with him? Have you <br/>\ninadvertantly made him think that having fun with science is only <br/>\nsomething that can happen as a reward for learning to read?  Why can&#39;t <br/>\nyou read him the instructions?  Perhaps an older sibling would enjoy <br/>\ndoing some fun experiments. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe made a chocolate volcano with no directions required, it was my <br/>\nson&#39;s idea.  What about you making some oobleck and letting him have <br/>\nfun, or baking cookies or things like that? We had more fun with our <br/>\nown volcano made up with thoughts and criticical thinking of how that <br/>\nchocolate would ooze out of the top, than the baking soda/vinegar <br/>\nvolcano or prepackaged electric volcano.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Sandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109394,"nextTopicId":109408}}
