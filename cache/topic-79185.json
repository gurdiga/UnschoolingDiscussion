But, still, <br/>\nthe kids were keyed up and all the new and fun stuff and just the <br/>\nhigh energy environment.   It took a day or so to settle down and <br/>\ncome back to &quot;real life&quot;.   But, one of the great things is, a lot of <br/>\nwhat we experienced at the conference IS our real lives.  We just <br/>\ndon&#39;t have 300 other folks to share it with.. at once!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI really enjoyed meeting folks and putting names with faces.  Most <br/>\nfolks were pretty much just how I pictured them... some, I didnt <br/>\nreally have a solid image in my mind, so it was really neat seeing <br/>\nthem and now having a visual to go with thier posts. Oh, I changed my <br/>\nemail to be ME instead of my husbands name.. lol.  So now folks don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to wonder what &quot;grlynbl&quot; means..  Now, I am just TeresaBnNC.. <br/>\npretty cut and dry, no more guessing.. :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\n Actually, I didn&#39;t get to &quot;connect&quot; with as many folks as I had <br/>\nhoped.  My kids demanded a lot of my attention and they wanted to me <br/>\nto be with them.  JP was fine zipping about on his own and playing <br/>\nwith Pam G&#39;s boys.   Anna began to feel more comfortable on Saturday <br/>\nand she made one good friend whom we plan on seeing as often as <br/>\npossible. She and I enjoyed making jewelry and pounding flowers. I <br/>\nwas so engrossed in those activities that I missed a couple of talks <br/>\nthat I really wanted to hear!.. But, thats OK, we were having a lot <br/>\nof fun with folks doing the funshops.    JP and Ethan loved making <br/>\nchain mail. Ethan wondered around, watching Yu-Gi-Oh duels and <br/>\nplaying PS2.  The good thing about Ethan&#39;s experience at the <br/>\nconference was that he did not NOT like it. Ususually he does not <br/>\nlike crowds and &quot;busy &#39;ness&quot;  But he was fine and he tolerated it <br/>\npretty well. I could tell that he was more relaxed and didn&#39;t have <br/>\nhis gaurd up as much as he usually does around other children.   They <br/>\nwere all disappointed that we didn&#39;t do anything for the talent show. <br/>\nWe had bounced a few ideas around and talked about some different <br/>\nthings, but we never made any concrete plans.  Now they have decided <br/>\nthat next year we will definitely do our &quot;thing&quot; at the conference.   <br/>\nI think that next year, they will have even more fun and be even more <br/>\ncomfortable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have to also add my thanks and &quot;applause&quot; to Kelly and Ben.  They <br/>\nwere both lovely and gracious hosts at the conference and made us <br/>\nfeel very welcomed and at home in Columbia. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the kids are ready for breakfast!  It was nice meeting some of <br/>\nyou guys in person.  I bet I actually met more folks on this list <br/>\nthan I am aware of.. lol.. I didn&#39;t realize who Bob and Joanna were <br/>\ntil this morning when I read some posts.  And Stepheny, I met her at <br/>\nthe pool.. and now I know who she is online.   ..ACKKK,  I gotta go, <br/>\nthe natives are restless..

It was SO cool to hear Sandra speak (man is she funny!) instead of seeing her laying in a hospital bed loopy on morphine (although she was funny then too).<br/>\n<br/>\nJalen chasing was my main activity at the conference, but I got to meet Shannon and Heidi and Pam S and HECK, just about everyone! Except YOU MaryB, whom I did expect to see and was disappointed. Ya missed a great event!<br/>\nI have to tell you all, Mary&#39;s T-shirts were COOL (she sent some to the conference), I especially liked that &quot;Warning: radical unschooler&quot; T.<br/>\nSo you all should check out her site if you want some cool unschooling T-shirts.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome highlights were:  Seeing Sandra and one of the Dad&#39;s peeling roasted green chili&#39;s in Kelly&#39;s kitchen last night. The whole house smelled like chilis from New Mexico....aaah.<br/>\nMy SHY dd getting up on stage with Joanna Wilkinson&#39;s dh and dd to sing &quot;Spongebob Squarepants&quot; to close the talent show.<br/>\nHearing Marji sing in her angelic voice as everyone teared up while listening.<br/>\nSitting up late in the hallway singing along with Sandra, Bob Wilkinson, Elissa, Stepheny and some other night owls. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere were so many great moments....and great people! It&#39;s amazing to be surrounded by likeminded folks, truly amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope some of you make it to the New England conference next year...and don&#39;t forget I&#39;m hosting the 2005 BEACH PARTY, right here in P&#39;cola!:) <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good to be back, all filled up with happy unschoolish memories.
