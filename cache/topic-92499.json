In","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2046965446\">We&#39;ve been having an &quot;it works!&quot; week around here it seems.  My 3 1/2 yr old <br/>\nson is currently building a huge castle with mega blocks in the living room.  <br/>\nIn the last few weeks he&#39;s gotten some books from the library and off ebay <br/>\nabout castles and medieval times.  Last weekend he even got grandma to sew him an <br/>\nawesome knight costume with his help of course!<br/>\nYesterday, he was removing the cushions off the couch to build yes, a castle <br/>\nout of them when he says &quot;Mom, there are 3 cushions on the couch, when I take <br/>\n1 off, then there are only 2 left!&quot;<br/>\nThen he wanted to make & play with index cards an alphabet and shapes <br/>\nmatching game.  Then we found when cleaning up the scrapbook supplies, a paint with <br/>\nwater castle & pirate book in my cupboard of old teaching supplies (former <br/>\ncareer of mine).  Then he practiced writing his name and a few other letters on <br/>\nhis &quot;work papers&quot; for daddy and used rubber stamps to make  gift bags to put <br/>\nthem in.<br/>\nRight now he&#39;s taking a break from building the castle to sort the megablocks <br/>\npeople into piles of police men, airport guys, and sorting the blocks by size <br/>\nand color!<br/>\nAnd people think that children&#39;s play is &quot;just play&quot;.<br/>\nAnyways, just wanted to share.  I&#39;ve been trying to remember what sort of fun <br/>\n&quot;learning activities&quot; go on around here during the day to tell my husband <br/>\nabout when he gets home.  Still working on convincing him about this, you see.  <br/>\nThink I&#39;ll go play on the old but new (to us) BLUE piano that we just <br/>\npurchased to have fun with!  <br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92465,"nextTopicId":92492}}
