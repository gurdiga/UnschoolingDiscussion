I try not to use the word","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2021905561\">Logan&#39;s first experience with Cuisenaire rods<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week we went to the &quot;learning store&quot;, which is the local teacher <br/>\nsupply store.  I try not to use the word teach or teacher around <br/>\nLogan.  I don&#39;t want him thinking he needs to be taught stuff, I want <br/>\nhim thinking he can learn stuff.  This store has a lot of stuff for <br/>\nhomeschoolers also, including Cuisenaire rods.  I&#39;ve been wanting to <br/>\nget these for awhile and have just been waiting for Logan to get old <br/>\nenough, he is 4 and a half now.  If you aren&#39;t familiar with <br/>\nCuisenaire rods, they are plastic rods of different lengths and <br/>\ncolors.  The smallest one is white and is 1 cube long, the next one <br/>\nis 2 cubes long and a different color, and so on up to 10 cubes <br/>\nlong.  They are great for playing with math concepts in a very visual <br/>\nmanner.  I got the ones that snap together since I thought these <br/>\nwould be easier for Logan to handle.  When we got home I put the rods <br/>\naway and forgot about them.  About an hour later Logan asked me to <br/>\nget out the sticks I got at the learning store.  I got them out and <br/>\ngave them to him to play with.  I didn&#39;t direct his play in anyway.  <br/>\nThe first thing he did with them was build skyscrapers, this didn&#39;t <br/>\nsurprise me because he had watched a video on how they build <br/>\nskyscrapers earlier that day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter building skyscrapers for awhile he noticed that the different <br/>\ncolor rods were different sizes.  He took the 10 rod, placed it on <br/>\nthe ground and then started snapping together 1 rods until they were <br/>\nas tall as the 10 rod.  He then counted how many 1 rods he used and <br/>\ntold me that the big rod was 10 long.  I said really?  He then did <br/>\nthis with each rod working his way down from 10.  When he got to 4 he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t need to use the 1 rods anymore, he could tell by looking at it <br/>\nthat it was 4 long, he did the same for 3 and 2.  After doing this he <br/>\nnoticed that the rods had lines on one side that were spaced out the <br/>\nsame as the 1 rod, so that you could count how long a rod was without <br/>\nputting the 1 rods next to it.  He counted how long each rod was <br/>\nusing this method and discovered he came up with the same answers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe then decided he wanted to put the rods in order from biggest to <br/>\nsmallest.  Instead of using a trial and error method he figured out <br/>\nhe could use the number long they are to put them in order.  Problem <br/>\nwas he was starting at 10 and working his way down, he&#39;s never <br/>\ncounted backwards from 10.  He knew 10 would be first so he put the <br/>\n10 down.  He wasn&#39;t sure what came next, but instead of asking me, he <br/>\nchecked his number chart that is hanging on the wall.  It has all the <br/>\nnumbers from 1-100 and has been hanging on the wall for almost a <br/>\nyear.  Using this chart he was able to put all the rods in order from <br/>\n10 to 1.  He then practiced counting backwards from 10 while touching <br/>\nthe appropriate rod.  Then he counted backwards from 10 without <br/>\ntouching the rods.  After doing this he started experimenting with <br/>\nputting different rods together and discovered that he could put the <br/>\n6 and 4 rods together and they were the same length as the 10 rod.  <br/>\nHe only did this a few times before he got tired of playing with the <br/>\nrods and I put them away.  He played with them for a little over a <br/>\nhalf hour and discovered many things in that time.  He did all this <br/>\nwith no coaching from me.  To me, this is the beauty of unschooling.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90206,"nextTopicId":90242}}
