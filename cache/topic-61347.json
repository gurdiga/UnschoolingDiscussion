People rush from one meeting/activity to the<br/>\nnext. They do the same with their kids. The more<br/>\nstuff you have, the more classes you do has come to be equated with how good<br/>\nyou are. Other humans have become superficial relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\n30 years ago my mum raised 3 kids alone. She washed laundry by hand and<br/>\ndried it on the line. She walked to the shops (she couldn&#39;t afford a car<br/>\nuntil I was 25) most days. Yet she had plenty of time too<br/>\nsee her friends. They dug vegetable gardens together. They made wine and<br/>\nthen sat around drinking it. I remember plenty of time to play in next doors<br/>\ngarden.<br/>\nMy cousin&#39;s two children never play outside. They don&#39;t have *time*. Both<br/>\nparenst work so the kids go to a child-minder after school. When they are<br/>\npicked up it is swimming class or soccer practice or<br/>\npiano lesson. Then its homework, TV and bed. Weekends are spent getting the<br/>\ngroceries or &#39;shopping&#39;. They&#39;ve never played in a stream or made snowmen.<br/>\nMy cousin is contsantly moaning that he has no<br/>\n*time*. I&#39;ve been to his house. Both of them have shiny new cars, a<br/>\nwide-screen TV - the kids have TV and DVD players too (they are 7 and 4).<br/>\nThe kids get new clothes every week.They have every labour<br/>\nsaving device known to man. Most of this stuff they have loans for. So they<br/>\nboth have to work in order to pay for the stuff they bought that was meant<br/>\nto give them more *time*.<br/>\nWhen I sugested to my cousin that he could work less over-time if he wasn&#39;t<br/>\npaying a car loan (and UK interest rates for car loans are often 17-23%) he<br/>\nwanted to know how he&#39;d get too work? It&#39;s a mile<br/>\naway......<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like madness. They are not happy, even with all this stuff they<br/>\nhave. They rarely see family as they are so busy. They have to schedule<br/>\nappointments to see friends, often weeks in advance.<br/>\nMy cousin once said he envied me staying at home, having friends drop in<br/>\nunexpectedly for coffee, my long walks with the kids doing nothing in<br/>\nparticuarly. Yet he could not see that it was his desire<br/>\nfor more new shiny stuff that meant that he could do none of those things.<br/>\nHe&#39;s over-weight and stressed :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

If you say &quot;No way!&quot; I say, &quot;Absolutely right.&quot; Because now, <br/>\nthanks to my new network marketing company, NoWay, you can make a fortune <br/>\nselling boxes of Nothing. I want you to think about all those people who told <br/>\nyou that nothing could make you rich and successful. Well, here is your chance<br/>\n to prove them right! Yes, if you feel you have been working for nothing all <br/>\nthese years, now it is time to have Nothing to work for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nI tell you, this is a business opportunity whose time has come, because no <br/>\nmatter what your problem is, Nothing will help. For example, Nothing has been <br/>\nproven to cure every disease imaginable. That&#39;s right. Studies show that <br/>\nplacebos alone are effective in about 20% of cases — and what better placebo <br/>\nthan Nothing? And you can forget about pesky product liability lawsuits. We <br/>\npromise Nothing — and we deliver. How many companies can make that claim? <br/>\n<br/>\nImagine how refreshing it will be for your friends who have been inundated <br/>\nwith multilevel marketing opportunities. You can truthfully tell them you <br/>\nhave Nothing to sell — and then sell it to them! Yes, in a world filled with <br/>\nproducts that are really nothing disguised as something, you can sell <br/>\nsomething disguised as nothing. Think of all those pessimystics out there who <br/>\ninsist that nothing can help the starving multitudes, nothing can alleviate <br/>\npoverty, nothing can revive our neighborless `hoods. I say, let&#39;s prove them <br/>\nright and prove them wrong at the same time. Imagine armies of homeless folks <br/>\nor unemployed young men selling boxes of Nothing door-to-door. &quot;They told me <br/>\nnothing could get me off the streets,&quot; they might say, &quot;and I am hoping they <br/>\nare right. Will you help?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nNow why, you might ask, would anyone be interested in buying Nothing? Well, <br/>\nfor one thing, most of us already have everything. In fact, we have so much o<br/>\nf everything that we can&#39;t appreciate nothing. After all, God made the <br/>\nentire Universe from nothing. And the same holds true of our own creations. <br/>\nEvery painting begins with an empty canvas, every book with a blank page, <br/>\nevery symphony with silence to be filled. As Harry Cohen Baba used to say, <br/>\n&quot;Listen, if you don&#39;t know nothing, you don&#39;t know nothing.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, being a FUNdamentalist, I couldn&#39;t resist putting some funny jokes <br/>\nabout nothing on the box. This is a perfect product for those diagnosed with <br/>\nhumorrhoids and who insist, &quot;Nothing makes me laugh.&quot; So not only will you be <br/>\nstriking a blow for the invisible nothing in a world cluttered with visible <br/>\nsomethings, but you will be raising the laugh force on the planet — and <br/>\ncreating a mannafestival of the first order. Imagine millions and millions of <br/>\npeople all around the globe being fed and prospered by Nothing. Now that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat I call manifesting manna!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Time","postDate":"1048131487","msgId":61428,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0Ny5kNWQ2OGI4LjJiYWE5MTlmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":61424,"nextInTopic":61429,"prevInTime":61427,"nextInTime":61429,"topicId":61347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/19/03 6:00:17 PM, mjsolich@iprimus.com.au writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1798282093\">In a message dated 3/19/03 6:00:17 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mjsolich@...\">mjsolich@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; One mum leaves the house at 6:30am and returns at<br/>\n<br/>\n6:30pm.

We were on a dead end street and aside from crickets, can&#39;t see much more making noise. I just really don&#39;t remember it being quiet. <br/>\n<br/>\nI moved to downtown Miami when I first left home 26 years ago. The contrast was exciting and it scared me too. After all these years of being here, not anywhere near as isolated as where I grew up, I got use to noise.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few years ago we vacationed at Anna Maria Island on the west coast of FL. Very small thin island. Our house was right on the Bay of Tampa. I remember going out on the balcony the first night and calling Joe out. I said listen. You couldn&#39;t hear a thing. Absolutely nothing. Not the water, not birds, not crickets, nothing. It was amazing to me. Sat out there with my wine for quite awhile just listening to nothing. It was wonderful but not sure if I could live like that. I actually like hearing the birds at night at the sound of the distant train going by.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Time","postDate":"1048094704","msgId":61375,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEtRjMxMkswS01sOVdLWm0wMDA0MjQ4MkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":61368,"nextInTopic":61376,"prevInTime":61374,"nextInTime":61376,"topicId":61347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

People rush from one meeting/activity to the next. They do the same with their kids. The more<br/>\nstuff you have, the more classes you do has come to be equated with how good you are. Other humans have become superficial relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\n30 years ago my mum raised 3 kids alone. She washed laundry by hand and dried it on the line. She walked to the shops (she couldn&#39;t afford a car until I was 25) most days. Yet she had plenty of time too<br/>\nsee her friends. They dug vegetable gardens together. They made wine and then sat around drinking it. I remember plenty of time to play in next doors garden.<br/>\nMy cousin&#39;s two children never play outside. They don&#39;t have *time*. Both parenst work so the kids go to a child-minder after school. When they are picked up it is swimming class or soccer practice or<br/>\npiano lesson. Then its homework, TV and bed. Weekends are spent getting the groceries or &#39;shopping&#39;. They&#39;ve never played in a stream or made snowmen. My cousin is contsantly moaning that he has no<br/>\n*time*. I&#39;ve been to his house. Both of them have shiny new cars, a wide-screen TV - the kids have TV and DVD players too (they are 7 and 4). The kids get new clothes every week.They have every labour<br/>\nsaving device known to man. Most of this stuff they have loans for. So they both have to work in order to pay for the stuff they bought that was meant to give them more *time*.<br/>\nWhen I sugested to my cousin that he could work less over-time if he wasn&#39;t paying a car loan (and UK interest rates for car loans are often 17-23%) he wanted to know how he&#39;d get too work? It&#39;s a mile<br/>\naway......<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like madness. They are not happy, even with all this stuff they have. They rarely see family as they are so busy. They have to schedule appointments to see friends, often weeks in advance.<br/>\nMy cousin once said he envied me staying at home, having friends drop in unexpectedly for coffee, my long walks with the kids doing nothing in particuarly. Yet he could not see that it was his desire<br/>\nfor more new shiny stuff that meant that he could do none of those things.

Many HS&#39;ers book playdates weeks in advance. No-one just drops round for<br/>\ncoffee anymore. One woman told me she couldn&#39;t spare 10 minutes to hang laundry outside to help the environment because she was &#39;too busy&#39;.<br/>\nAll this stressful rushing around can&#39;t be right.<br/>\nI suppose thats why I like unschooling so much. No deadlines, no schedules, no stress. Just time unfolding as it should :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61329,"nextTopicId":61445}}
