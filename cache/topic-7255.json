I was on this list a while ago, but had to unsub<br/>\nbecause of all the email. I couldn&#39;t take it anymore and missed the support<br/>\nand info!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son (9yo) and daughter (4 1/2 yo) also have &#39;different&#39; hours  :-) At<br/>\nabout 9:30 or 10:00 a certain energy comes over our house. Nicholas and<br/>\nEmily sometimes get a project out and start working on it, or maybe a game,<br/>\nor sometimes we all read or talk, maybe doing dishes and a late batch of<br/>\ncookies, who knows! Some of our best discussions happen in the evening.<br/>\nSaturday nights are usually late ones, last night the kids got to sleep<br/>\nabout 12:30, but Nicholas woke up at about 9:15 and Emily rose at 10:00.<br/>\nThey are well rested and having a blast right now. Nicholas seems to need<br/>\nless sleep than me at times. There are some nights that they end up in bed<br/>\nat 9:30 or 10:00. I think it&#39;s all following their natural schedule.<br/>\nSometimes they know that it&#39;s a get-to-bed early night as they may be a<br/>\nlittle more tired than usual.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily, probably because of her age, gets to sleep shortly after we&#39;re done<br/>\nreading to her at night. Nicholas, on the other hand, listens to some of<br/>\nEmily&#39;s stories ( I think he like the American Girls books just as much as<br/>\nwe do!) then starts reading his book. He&#39;s been hooked on the Redwall books<br/>\nlately, and stays up for an hour or two after Emily, reading. Reading<br/>\nreading reading. DH and myself comment at times at what the heck would we<br/>\nhave done if we had the opportunity to read like that. How wonderful that<br/>\nwould be. I remember getting so &#39;into&#39; a Stephen King book when I was in<br/>\nhigh school that I stayed home from school for three days to finish it. Now<br/>\nthe schools make kids read for homework-a chore???? Nicholas and Emily get<br/>\nabsolutely baffled when they hear a child say they have to read a certain<br/>\nbook for homework. Yesterday Nicholas crawled back into bed after breakfast<br/>\n( this was at about 11:00) and read until almost 2:00. The weather was too<br/>\nnice to stay inside any longer....<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that when there is something that someone needs to get up early for,<br/>\nthe will do it. We are ever changing and evolving. Schedules, plans,<br/>\ninterests.......I say relax and enjoy it. A lot of people don&#39;t understand<br/>\nit. I know that I couldn&#39;t possibly make my kids go to bed at 9:00, it would<br/>\nbe torture. ESPECIALLY with the days getting longer, we are out in the<br/>\ngarden usually until 9:30 or later! The kids are happy, and I figure that<br/>\nsomething must be going right  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\n<br/>\nBrynn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"bctswim@aol.com","from":"bctswim@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"EP9TiBrXMLHmwcWXSeEFSA0ekOlElq35taNJ2NagdbRu9sKVJ2hh2vocIS4v7hO37gOEN3GD","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] New to Unschooling","postDate":"953954243","msgId":7289,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU2LjMyNTNmNGUuMjYwZDg5YzNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":7280,"nextInTopic":7309,"prevInTime":7288,"nextInTime":7290,"topicId":7255,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Teresa, What is it with the world and the waking up early thing?!

In my not-so-humble opinion, there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with your son staying up late and sleeping late.  From birth, none of my 3 children","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1756028938\">Hi Help!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my not-so-humble opinion, there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with your<br/>\nson staying up late and sleeping late.  From birth, none of my 3<br/>\nchildren were sleepers.  They were all nighthawks.  Our schedule,<br/>\ntherefore, has been quite &quot;off&quot; for the last 10 years.  For the longest<br/>\nwhile I thought we were freaks and had to deal with constant criticism<br/>\nthat somehow my children would not thrive unless bedded down by 9 pm the<br/>\nlatest, and up by 7 am.  I hate to disappoint the world, but kids grow<br/>\njust as tall and are just as healthy, watching midnight programming and<br/>\noften missing mornings altogether.  (Though there are times when my<br/>\nchildren experience sunrises-particularly at this time of year as the<br/>\ndays are getting longer-simply because they have been up all night!) <br/>\nThe good news is, I have recently aligned myself with a group of<br/>\nunschoolers here in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and to my great surprise<br/>\nmany of my cohorts have come clean and confessed to the same schedule! <br/>\n(i.e. late nights, late mornings)  Then a big-wig university professor<br/>\nfrom the faculty of education no less, proudly announced that his<br/>\nunschooled daughter was up past midnight every night watching the late<br/>\nmovies!  And she had better English than any of her peers!  She had a<br/>\nmuch greater command of language, from a young age, just from watching<br/>\nand hearing the dramatic dialogue in some of the world&#39;s most classic<br/>\nmovies.  (I think she&#39;s in university now as an English major)  Anyway,<br/>\nI&#39;ve also come to realize that we non-conforming unschoolers DO have<br/>\nroutine worked-out with our kids.  If being in bed by 8 and up by 6 is a<br/>\nroutine, why isn&#39;t being in bed by 1 and up at 11? People who work the<br/>\nlate shift aren&#39;t on a routine?  But 9 to 5-ers are? What kind of<br/>\ndiscrimination is that?  The other thing I&#39;ve learned from my university<br/>\nprof friend is people get up in the morning when they have incentive. <br/>\nFor instance, his formerly late-night daughter does not object to<br/>\ngetting up early now for class because she has found what she truly<br/>\nloves.  And face it, money i.e. a job, can be a great motivator too when<br/>\nnecessary.<br/>\nYour son will be fine and will thrive if this is what he needs right<br/>\nnow.  It&#39;s not to say this is how it will always be.  And as time goes<br/>\non if he decides he hates mornings, he&#39;ll be primed for late shift duty<br/>\non the job.  In the meantime, rest assured you&#39;re in good company.  At<br/>\nleast up here in Canada!<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  Did I mention how great it is for family time when the kids stay<br/>\nup late?  Firstly, my 10 and 7 year olds have established the most<br/>\nintimate and loving relationship with their 17 mo. old baby sibling<br/>\nsince they stay up with him.  If I insisted my older ones get to bed<br/>\nearlier they would miss out on some of the baby&#39;s best moods.  Obviously<br/>\ntraditional schooling and same schedule would greatly hamper that whole<br/>\nbonding process.  And secondly, we find we don&#39;t have the usual<br/>\ndisturbances of phones, appointments, other people, etc. after 10 pm. <br/>\nWe can then have our quiet bonding down time, undisturbed.  Family<br/>\ncloseness is usually the number one reason for homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim Holderby wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Kim Holderby&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tyquondoe@...\">tyquondoe@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello, I am new to unschooling--actually to homeschooling period!  My<br/>\n&gt; son is 8 & 1/2 and has been home since about Feb 1.  He was in public<br/>\n&gt; school (3rd grade) in Arkansas.  I am so interested in doing this for<br/>\n&gt; him.  He is a gifted child and extremely bright.  However, he hates<br/>\n&gt; school!  I need some advice and feedback, I think.  My husband is<br/>\n&gt; very, very supportive of all of this, but is having trouble with the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;unstructuredness&quot; of it all.  Both my son and I are similar in that<br/>\n&gt; we are very unstructured, spontaneous learners, where my husband is<br/>\n&gt; completely the opposite..very methodical, very routine-oriented.  I<br/>\n&gt; am trying NOT to push my son.  He is resisting ANY schooling right<br/>\n&gt; now.  All he seems to want to do is play video games and watch TV!<br/>\n&gt; He hates to write, for one thing.  Which is one thing he detested<br/>\n&gt; about school.  I haven&#39;t seemed to find the &quot;spark&quot; for him yet.<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s interested in EVERYTHING, it seems.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know I am rambling here!  Is there anything wrong with letting my<br/>\n&gt; son stay up late and sleep late?  My husband seems to think he should<br/>\n&gt; have a set bedtime and get up early to start his day.  Guess what?<br/>\n&gt; That doesn&#39;t seem to work with Benjamin (my son).  Which is one of<br/>\n&gt; the reasons I chose to take him out of public schools!  They seemed<br/>\n&gt; much more interested in recording attendance than they did<br/>\n&gt; challenging and stimulating my child!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I will close for now...not sure if any of this makes sense.

My<br/>\n&gt; son is 8 & 1/2 and has been home since about Feb 1.  He was in public<br/>\n&gt; school (3rd grade) in Arkansas.  I am so interested in doing this for<br/>\n&gt; him.  He is a gifted child and extremely bright.  However, he hates<br/>\n&gt; school!  I need some advice and feedback, I think.  My husband is<br/>\n&gt; very, very supportive of all of this, but is having trouble with the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;unstructuredness&quot; of it all.  Both my son and I are similar in that<br/>\n&gt; we are very unstructured, spontaneous learners, where my husband is<br/>\n&gt; completely the opposite..very methodical, very routine-oriented.  I<br/>\n&gt; am trying NOT to push my son.  He is resisting ANY schooling right<br/>\n&gt; now.  All he seems to want to do is play video games and watch TV!<br/>\n&gt; He hates to write, for one thing.  Which is one thing he detested<br/>\n&gt; about school.  I haven&#39;t seemed to find the &quot;spark&quot; for him yet.<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s interested in EVERYTHING, it seems.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know I am rambling here!  Is there anything wrong with letting my<br/>\n&gt; son stay up late and sleep late?  My husband seems to think he should<br/>\n&gt; have a set bedtime and get up early to start his day.  Guess what?<br/>\n&gt; That doesn&#39;t seem to work with Benjamin (my son).  Which is one of<br/>\n&gt; the reasons I chose to take him out of public schools!  They seemed<br/>\n&gt; much more interested in recording attendance than they did<br/>\n&gt; challenging and stimulating my child!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will close for now...not sure if any of this makes sense.  Please<br/>\n&gt; respond with ANY feedback!  I haven&#39;t found a support group here in<br/>\n&gt; Northwest Arkansas yet.  We have Christian beliefs, but are not<br/>\n&gt; &quot;religious&quot;.

You have come to the right place for support, and you are <br/>\ngoing to get lots of feed back.  I just want to say that both my sons, 9 and <br/>\n11, and I are night people.  We stay up late and sleep late.  We have always <br/>\ndone this.  My husband works late most nights, we eat dinner VERY late, when <br/>\nthe boys are in sports, their practice and games can get us home and eating, <br/>\ntherefore up late. When the boys were about 8 and 10 my husband started to <br/>\nhave a problem with the getting up late.  I asked him why they needed to get <br/>\nup.  His response was that they needed to get up and get the day going, or <br/>\nthat they needed to learn to get up.  Again I asked why, if they have to get <br/>\nup early for something, they do, but why should they if we get our work done <br/>\nduring the day?  If it is because someday they will have to work, well, so <br/>\nwhat, that is why the world runs on shifts!  I worked 3-11 and 11-7 all my <br/>\nworking career, cause I hate to go to bed at 9pm and get up at 5:30am.  <br/>\nPeople work from home, set their own hours. There are to many alternatives.  <br/>\nSo, why get up early? If it is so we can get school out of the way, and then <br/>\nhave the day to go play, that is fine, and we do that, but not just because <br/>\nyou should be up by 8am cause that is what people do.  So, now he doesn&#39;t say <br/>\nanything, I don&#39;t know if he agrees with me or not, but he doesn&#39;t say <br/>\nanything.  I think he secretly thinks it is being lazy or unchristian to stay <br/>\nin bed. hehehe<br/>\nAnyway, my two cents, and again, welcome<br/>\nTeresa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Dara McMichael","from":"Dara McMichael &lt;mcmich@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"pHWeBbSChuwoLb02PYat3f-68xoq-YDAHtFbV62PU5mq9z5lHXNjvrrsIPBQVvW2ykRIhSgde8oagk5BvgswDTDmS_U_hqsCvnndUA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] New to Unschooling","postDate":"953826657","msgId":7255,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4REEzRDYxLjEwODYwNEY2QGJlbGxzb3V0aC5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDhiZGNxaytpZWNoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7256,"prevInTime":7254,"nextInTime":7256,"topicId":7255,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kim, I am new too and haven t started yet but I have a similar situation.

I think you should introduce some structured<br/>\ntime into each day where your son knows he has certain<br/>\nthings he needs to accomplish in that period.  If your<br/>\nhusband sees an improvement in your son he is more likely to<br/>\nsupport the less structured schooling. It may be that your<br/>\nhusband wants more adult time with you and having children<br/>\nup late seems to prevent adult conversation without<br/>\ndistractions.
