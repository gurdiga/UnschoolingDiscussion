This has to be decided by Sept. 30 an we are going to the lake for a month as of This weekend.  So I have three days.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my options are to either switch school boards (which I&#39;m not to sure about) or go blended and have to work my way around some curriculum crap.  All I&#39;m technically supposed to do is prove that the information was covered.  No tests but it should be reflected in our portfolio.  So sitting down for a few afternoons and showing my kids the pages and trying to work a few of the topics into conversation would be the minimal required amount of participation.  Assuming they have no interest in the topics I would be required to introduce. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan I say AAHHHHHH!!!!!  Just to relieve the tension.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would jump to another board no problem except this one has a really cool library, free photocopying and other things, and they have a parents lounge that I can cook/rest in when we make trips to the city.  The other boards are more like distance Ed and have no resources to borrow or places to hang out nothing.  (the reason why ours full I guess)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have evil schooly thoughts about my son (who was in the top of his class in grade one for everything) having to write something down.  He used to write legibly, was excited about spelling and writing stories, now he won&#39;t put pencil to paper unless he has to and I can barely read his writing.  Ug I scold myself for it but it&#39;s my fault to a great degree as I tried to school at home off and on and my heart just wasn&#39;t in it so I gave him mixed messages and he lost confidence.  I was also critical of his writing as he would start his r&#39;s from the back and made the little tick on the tops of his n&#39;s and m&#39;s after he drew the arch.  His teacher was also a &quot;candy, sticker, smilyface reward&quot; teacher and I am not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have asked my son how important it is to him that he remain with this board.  He says it&#39;s very important and &quot;I guess&quot; when asked if he wants to do the work they would require of him.   My thoughts are to register my son (he&#39;s 8 and would be going into grade 4) at the school board we&#39;ve gone with before and register my dd 6yo. in a traditional program at another school board.  She hasn&#39;t been to school and I don&#39;t want to &quot;do school&quot; with her, ever.  I don&#39;t want to force my son to do school but I&#39;m (in that evil schooly place in the back of my head) kind of interested to see if ds would like writing if it he just had to do a little for school work.  I know I&#39;m more relaxed with him on this as he has attended school before.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo advice from the &quot;non biased about my kids&quot; masses on this list would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact Any advice would be appreciated.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa in Canada<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79169,"nextTopicId":79111}}
