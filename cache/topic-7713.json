I have 3 children and nursed all of them.  Some people<br/>\nwere very uncomfortable with it and couldn&#39;t be in the same<br/>\nroom while I was doing it.  Go with your gut feeling.  No<br/>\nmatter what you do, people will question the decision you<br/>\nmake either way.  AS IF it is their decision to make!  My<br/>\nhusband was uncomfortable at first (his whole family was<br/>\nthat way!) But he realized what a great thing it was and<br/>\nsupported me when he saw the weight gain and money saved!<br/>\nThe rest of his family never came around but who cares, it<br/>\nwas our baby.<br/>\nGood luck and stand firm, whatever you decide!<br/>\nDara</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7711,"nextTopicId":7700}}
