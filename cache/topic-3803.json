I have been unsuccessful in finding anything of that sort.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I did not mean to imply that we have the standards for other countries.  We have been so busy just getting the standards for various states and finding supporting materials that we have not looked for standards for other countries yet.  I believe I saw some for England yesterday but have not had a chance to take a close look yet.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;  Another question: do you think that fulfilling those requirements which is usually checked by passing an exam, guarantees good education? <br/>\n&gt;&gt;  If not, maybe such comparisons do not make much sense. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;  If so, how come Americans still seem to be awarded the most Nobel Prices per capita?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The standards that we have found are most hard, cold academic standards.  Some are very difficult to decipher what the authors might be looking for.  And you are correct--usually one would think the only way to check a child&#39;s ability to measure up to the standards would be to test him or her.  But I don&#39;t go much for that.  I believe that if I interact with them on the learning enough, I will know where they are pretty much.  Often we will make up a set of questions before an activity, field trip or movie and have the children answer them.  Sometimes we do it verbally, sometimes they must write there answers, sometimes in group and sometimes separately.  Then we will interactively do the activity, take the field trip or watch the movie and we will give the same or similar set of questions to answer.  We discuss it all.  These types of activities, etc. are often tied to one extent or other to an area of learning we feel they might not be progressing well enough in.  So we know where they are in relation to where we think they should be without any formal testing.  We never have a pass or fail or grade or any of that nonsense.  If they know, we give them love and praise,  If they do not know, we give them love and help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; If not, maybe such comparisons do not make much sense. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The way most testing is done, I do not believe that passing a test proves one has learned any particular material.  I have never been comfortable with the artificial importance given to grades and tests.  Tests in most settings are to state that one has passed or failed in a certain area.  And to what extent one has passed or failed.  But all of this comparison of having learned a particular fact or not seems like a bit of nonsense to me.  I do not think we should compare children&#39;s learning with each other so much as we should simply check where they are in relation to the material we think they ought to learn.  And then only so we can help them.  This is not a pass or fail situation.  It is life!  To me, tests are just tools for us to use to see where we can help.  Unless we are force by some law to have our children tested, or unless they feel like they want to be formally tested for college or something, we will not bother with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; If so, how come Americans still seem to be awarded the most Nobel Prices per capita?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am sorry, I do not see what you are saying here.  But I do not think that our wonderful melting pot of people win so many Nobel Prices because of having been tested somewhere along the line.  Certainly comparisons at many points in our lives are inevitable and necessary.  I am sure these folks that have to decide who gets a particular Nobel Prize have to do a lot of comparing of the potential winners.  But that is not the same as comparing one child against another for having learned a particular fact or not--right?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Do not get me wrong, I am also very concerned and worried that maybe we are not learning enough and maybe we are missing some   <br/>\n&gt;&gt; opportunities. Child lead learning is fine but a child may not always know where to lead if we do not expose her/him to all areas of <br/>\n&gt;&gt; knowledge. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, of course, a child can not be expected to lead in areas they do not know about.  It is our job to know if we can or find out if we don&#39;t.  At least when they are younger.  But a child will usually be able to lead us in a direction by his or her interests.  I remember one time we were in the pool with my oldest son (11 now) and he saw a beautiful sail boat go by on the Intercoastal Waterway.  He asked what kind of boat it was and I told him.  He asked what those big things were sticking up out of it and why it did not tip over and where was the motor and... a lot more questions.  So we went with that for a while.  We assisted him in asking some neighbors if he could come aboard and take a look at their boats (human relations, self-esteem, responsibility, planning, execution).  There is a lot more to this but I am running too long already.
