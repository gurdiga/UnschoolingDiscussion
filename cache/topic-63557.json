We were looking at the virtual frog dissection page (which she <br/>\nthinks is way cool, so thanks for sending it along) and I asked her why it is <br/>\nthat she wants to be a doctor.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer answer at first was short, typical of teenagers, &quot;I&#39;ve ALWAYS wanted to <br/>\nbe a doctor, you KNOW this&quot;.  I said of course I KNOW this, and I&#39;ve watched <br/>\nher and think I know why but I&#39;d like for her to tell me.  She rapidly <br/>\nexplained to me that it was a GOOD career choice because if you look at any <br/>\nof the projections the medical field is going to be in short supply by the <br/>\ntime she would be a licensed doctor.  OK.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then she began to tell me that she learned early on that there were &quot;good&quot; <br/>\ndoctors and the &quot;not so good&quot; ones.  Some really make a difference in really <br/>\n&quot;being&quot; with you when you are sick, not just thinking of you as a list of lab <br/>\ntests and ailments to &quot;fix&quot;.  That a &quot;good&quot; doctor would be employable almost <br/>\nanywhere in the world and be able to affect others in a good way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI pointed out to here that sometimes sad things come from the medical field, <br/>\nsome fields have a lot of death and dying.  She told me that is another <br/>\nreason &quot;good&quot; doctors are so needed.  She reminded me of when her baby <br/>\nbrother died and the doctor seemed totally distance and almost hateful with <br/>\nus.  I told her while it was hurtful to us, he probably had to be that way to <br/>\nshield himself.   She said EXACTLY why there NEEDS to be GOOD doctors.  You <br/>\nhave to accept death as part of life and you are their to HELP your patients <br/>\nand their families at times like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to add we&#39;ve had our share of family deaths this year, six since Sept. <br/>\n Five since December, all different ages, all but one very unexpected.  So <br/>\nmaybe that pain is what drives her today, maybe tomorrow it will be something <br/>\nelse.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe did tell me about how if you EVER really got &quot;bummed out&quot; (her term) and <br/>\nfelt you weren&#39;t being the BEST doctor to your patients anymore, you can <br/>\nalways go into research or teach.  She said both of those things would be <br/>\nreally neat too do too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo without pushing for more that&#39;s about all she said and was off to look at <br/>\nthe frog stuff yet again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI asked her if I could share her thoughts with this list, she said sure, but <br/>\nmake sure you tell them about the neat cell cake we baked last week.  So, we <br/>\nbaked a round cake, frosted it and she decorated it with candies and such to <br/>\nrepresent a cell, she&#39;s done it before but was in the mood to either bake, <br/>\nbuy licorice whips and fire balls and gum drops and jelly beans, to <br/>\nexperiment more, or maybe just eat cake!  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe did show it to the neighborhood children and tell them all the names of <br/>\nthe parts of a cell before she let them have any, they seemed awe struck, but <br/>\nthey are eight years old and down.  She loved it that they loved it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there is &quot;part&quot; of the reason as she left it with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"genant2@aol.com","from":"genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] learning by osmosis (was new member intro)","postDate":"1049820852","msgId":63633,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjMS43Y2QyNjljLjJiYzQ1OGI0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":63628,"nextInTopic":63647,"prevInTime":63632,"nextInTime":63634,"topicId":63557,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/8/03 12:47:13 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

There&#39;s <br/>\nthe possibility of his doing ROTC, but if air force is really his interest, <br/>\nthis isn&#39;t the town.  Homeschoolers and even unschoolers have done the air <br/>\nforce academy in Colorado Springs, but Marty&#39;s likely to be a big guy, not <br/>\nair force size.  Navy sized, maybe.  There&#39;s naval ROTC at the University of <br/>\nNew Mexico.  If he gets much taller he won&#39;t be submarine-size.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I thought all those things, but I didn&#39;t say them to Marty.  Maybe when it <br/>\ncomes up again.  Maybe he&#39;ll end up being a produce buyer, or do fancy paint <br/>\njobs on city busses.  There&#39;s a contest for kids to design a paint job for a <br/>\ncity bus here, and someone does it.  All those things catch the kids&#39; <br/>\ninterests.
