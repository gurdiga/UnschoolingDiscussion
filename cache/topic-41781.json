Nothing serious <br/>\nand I knew they just needed a little space and time and they&#39;d then be able <br/>\nto work it out.

She can really be a brat sometimes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUgh. Oof. And OMG!<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt like *I* got punched in the stomach. Niki is just the sweetest little <br/>\nmunchkin in the world. How anyone could call that wonderful little person a <br/>\nbrat is beyond me.
