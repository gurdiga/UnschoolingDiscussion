Actually, what you illustrate through your<br/>\nstory is that the difference between &quot;unschooling&quot; and other approaches<br/>\nto homeschooling are often not as different as some would make it seem.<br/>\nAll &quot;unschoolers&quot; allow their children to be influenced in what they<br/>\nbecome interested in either by themselves, siblings, other adults, or<br/>\nthings which come their way.  It is possible to use workbooks and be<br/>\nconsistent with &quot;unschooling&quot; approaches if the child acknowledges,<br/>\nunderstands, and contracts to use them if s/he appreciates (and desires)<br/>\nthe value to be obtained at the other end.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample -- &quot;Jim, you want to be able to set the torque on the engine<br/>\nwith me?&quot; &quot;Yeah, Dad, that would be great!&quot;  &quot;Okay, but I have to tell<br/>\nyou that in order to be able to do that you&#39;ll have to understand and be<br/>\nable to compute torque ratios.  That&#39;s what I have to do.&quot;  &quot;Oh? How do<br/>\nI learn to do that?&quot;  &quot;Well, I could show you how to do the math and<br/>\ngive you some problems to practice.

Okay?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference is not whether one sits at a desk, runs the lemonade<br/>\nstand, uses the pocket calculator, or just hangs around with Dad (or the<br/>\nnext door neighbor).  The difference in &quot;unschooling&quot; lies in allowing<br/>\nthe child to understand the positive consequences of learning and<br/>\nallowing her to contract for it when she, and she alone, is ready.<br/>\nFacilitating lots of exposure, and giving the kids the benefit of your<br/>\nexperience and judgment in helping them understand how they can fulfill<br/>\ntheir knowledge quests  (knowing there may be many different ways to do<br/>\nso), is what my concept of &quot;unschooling&quot; would be.  So if the<br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; word is block to mutual understanding, get rid of it (as<br/>\nyou found you finally didn&#39;t need to, but it might have helped along the<br/>\nway.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\njulie1264 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Priss1000@...\">Priss1000@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m near Greenville, SC,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My husband is supportive of homeschooling but not of unschooling.
