I think that&#39;s because they don&#39;t entirely sound like &quot;answers&quot; <br/>\nto people who are looking for another concrete rule to replace the one <br/>\nthey&#39;re giving up. What we really give them are very general principles and <br/>\nexamples of how those play out in our own specific and idiosyncratic lives - <br/>\nbut that&#39;s hard to &quot;get&quot; when you&#39;re looking for a rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we don&#39;t have a rule that says &quot;bedtime is at 9 pm,&quot; then what bedtime <br/>\nrule DO we have? Lost of times people think that the new rule is then ONLY, <br/>\n&quot;bedtime is whenever it happens.&quot; They think that means the parents stop <br/>\nthinking about the child&#39;s sleep needs. But, in all the families that I know <br/>\nwho have no rule about bedtimes, the parents are consciously and actively <br/>\nhelping their kids get a good sense of taking care of their sleep needs. The <br/>\nrule doesn&#39;t just flip-flop from bedtime to &quot;no bedtime&quot;  -- there is a whole <br/>\nhuge different way of handling and learning about sleep needs that replaces <br/>\nthe entire concept of a &quot;bedtime.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo change the subject but make the same point...<br/>\n<br/>\n People at park day were having a conversation about video games and some of <br/>\nus were talking about not setting limits on them. As usual, someone assumed <br/>\nthat that meant that our kids would be spending 24 hours a day, day after <br/>\nday, only on that with no other interests developing, etc. So we were talking <br/>\nabout that - about all the OTHER stuff that we do and how they learn etc. <br/>\n(You&#39;ve heard it all before, here, so I&#39;m not repeating all that - but it was <br/>\na lot of discussion there at the park.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen - there was this startling moment when one person said, &quot;But it is so <br/>\nexpensive to buy video games - how can you let them have unlimited video <br/>\ngames without going broke? We could never afford that.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSilence.<br/>\n<br/>\nWow. Talk about flip-flopping. She took us arguing against rules like &quot;You <br/>\nmay have exactly one hour per day of video game time,&quot; or &quot;You may spend the <br/>\nafternoon playing absolutely anything you want as long as it doesn&#39;t involve <br/>\ntv or videogames&quot; as saying that we&#39;d buy our kids an unlimited stock of <br/>\nwhatever videogames they wanted?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell - some of the kids happened to BE there right then and heard that bit <br/>\nand THEY reacted immediately with, &quot;We usually have to buy our OWN games.&quot; <br/>\nShe was somewhat bewildered, I think. In fact, I think it was news to her <br/>\nthat we didn&#39;t control the videogame time of our kids with arbitrary rules. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that amused me  was that she&#39;d heard &quot;unlimited videogames&quot; as <br/>\nmeaning that we would BUY them whatever they wanted whenever they wanted <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk about a failure to communicate!!! When we say what we do NOT do (we <br/>\ndon&#39;t have bedtimes, for example) we sometimes can&#39;t even imagine what people <br/>\nmight be thinking we do do &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45495,"nextTopicId":45534}}
