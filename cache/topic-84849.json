Just thought I&#39;d throw <br/>\nmy .02 in, because I&#39;ve been where you are.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, you sound like where I&#39;ve been for the nearly one year since <br/>\nI dropped curriculum completely. I&#39;ve been letting the kids play as <br/>\nmuch computer as they want, but holding on to this notion that they <br/>\ncould be spending their time better...which, even though I didn&#39;t <br/>\nreally voice it out loud (i.e. &quot;Okay, offa there, NOW!&quot;)...my <br/>\nattitude was leaking into my relationship with especially my 10 year <br/>\nold boy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne difference in our life right now: we live in the country and have <br/>\nmade a committment not to run as much, until we get moved to an area <br/>\nwhere you don&#39;t have to run to get to lessons and community events. <br/>\nThis means, there just isn&#39;t much variety for my kids to choose from, <br/>\nthus they are playing computer and watching videos a LOT. I know, if <br/>\nthere was more to offer, they&#39;d be choosing otherwise more often.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it is, though Sonic the Hedgehog seems to be dominating their <br/>\ntime, I have truly changed my mind about it...very recently, in fact. <br/>\nWhen I translated computer games into bicycle riding, I realized my <br/>\nattitude about it was silly. &quot;Oh no! My boy is riding his bike, all <br/>\nday LONG!&quot; as if that was a bad thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, he is WAY into Sonic, but it hasn&#39;t ruined his ability to do <br/>\nall kinds of other things. As a matter of fact, the VCR is on the <br/>\nfritz right now, so TV is out, and he just hauled out the Legos to <br/>\nplay with. He didn&#39;t stand there twitching or whining about nothing <br/>\nto do (it was somebody else&#39;s turn on the computer...MINE! ;) just <br/>\ngot out something else to do and started doing it. (note: He used to <br/>\nwhine about it, when it wasn&#39;t his turn...when I was still fretting <br/>\nabout computer and TV time)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also pitched in with everyone, when we did a Massive Wood <br/>\nGathering and Log Splitting Afternoon. In fact, he is the one who <br/>\ntaught me how to place the wedge and whack at it with the mallet. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nso, after almost a year of playing as much computer as he possibly <br/>\nCAN, my boy is also capable of lots of things, voluntarily chooses <br/>\nthings not computer, not TV, and yet is very excited about Sonic, <br/>\ntoo. When he conquers a level, because I have expressed interest in <br/>\nit (I can conquer a level in Sonic, my own self )...I am the person <br/>\nhe comes dashing to, all excited and proud, to tell me how he did it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I hope you have a bit to chew on between the replies you&#39;ve <br/>\ngotten. This was my main &quot;concern&quot; for many months, but no more. I <br/>\nthink it took longer because I hadn&#39;t really &quot;given up&quot; but now that <br/>\nI really and truly do not fret about it, he&#39;s quickly showing that he <br/>\nwill turn to other things when presented.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, HeidiC<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monie42001&quot; <br/>\n&lt;mfredlund@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\nBut <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m in a quandry about the video games( and computer games online) <br/>\n&gt; and Tv(pbs shows).

I&#39;ve been homeschooling for almost 3<br/>\n&gt; years, with an eclectic approach, generally relaxed with sporadic<br/>\n&gt; attempts at a structured schedule, which I despise.  I have 4 kids-<br/>\n&gt; 11,7,5,3.  I have been familar with unschooling since the beginning,<br/>\n&gt; but I have been focused on a semi curriculum( Waldorf, Charlotte<br/>\n&gt; mason, Well trained mind),and what ever else stuck my fancy...  I<br/>\n&gt; have a real preference for literature.  Any way...  I&#39;m breaking<br/>\n&gt; away from all  of that and I&#39;m buying into the idea that my kids can<br/>\n&gt; decide what tthey want to learn without my direct, direction.  But<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m in a quandry about the video games( and computer games online)<br/>\n&gt; and Tv(pbs shows).  My view is that if one is encouraging your child<br/>\n&gt; to be self led in interests and learning, that It would be<br/>\n&gt; appropriate to allow them to play video games/Tv until the cows come<br/>\n&gt; home and they decide to do something different.

I&#39;ve been homeschooling for almost 3 <br/>\nyears, with an eclectic approach, generally relaxed with sporadic <br/>\nattempts at a structured schedule, which I despise.  I have 4 kids-<br/>\n11,7,5,3.  I have been familar with unschooling since the beginning, <br/>\nbut I have been focused on a semi curriculum( Waldorf, Charlotte <br/>\nmason, Well trained mind),and what ever else stuck my fancy...  I <br/>\nhave a real preference for literature.  Any way...  I&#39;m breaking <br/>\naway from all  of that and I&#39;m buying into the idea that my kids can <br/>\ndecide what tthey want to learn without my direct, direction.  But <br/>\nI&#39;m in a quandry about the video games( and computer games online) <br/>\nand Tv(pbs shows).  My view is that if one is encouraging your child <br/>\nto be self led in interests and learning, that It would be <br/>\nappropriate to allow them to play video games/Tv until the cows come <br/>\nhome and they decide to do something different.  I have read that <br/>\nchildren will actually decide they would rather do something <br/>\nelse...Has this been anyone&#39;s experience?  On the other hand,I am <br/>\nhaving some serious fears that my boys will become adults adept only <br/>\nat Nintendo Star Fox, or the like... And I think it might be <br/>\nappropriate to set limits on the amount of media time daily.<br/>\nIn the past, I have used Media privledges as a successful motivator <br/>\nto get specific studying completed.  But In unschooling this will be <br/>\nunnecessary.  So you experienced people out there, what are your <br/>\nviews?  enlighten me, If you will<br/>\n<br/>\nMonica</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84907,"nextTopicId":84781}}
