He keeps trying until he beats the level <br/>\nand then the game itself or whatever else he&#39;s trying to do.

We had been learning","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2062820186\">I&#39;ve been a member of this group on and off for a while. I really <br/>\nenjoy reading all the advice and how-to&#39;s.Here&#39;s why I&#39;m at my wits <br/>\nend. We had been learning at home since about 2nd grade with my son <br/>\nChris. Last fall he wanted to go back to school. He&#39;s 10 now and I <br/>\nreally think he thought he was missing something even though we did a <br/>\nlot of different stuff. I&#39;m not one to sit around at home. I tried to <br/>\ntalk him out of it but this was something he really wanted to do. So <br/>\noff he went to school. In the beginning it was fun. He liked meeting <br/>\nthe kids and doing the fun stuff about school.But now the teachers <br/>\nare getting at him to work harder and get his homework done and <br/>\nturned in. I help him with all this but it&#39;s something he hates to <br/>\ndo. He has a lot of trouble with his handwriting. The teachers are <br/>\nreally on him about being neat and he trys but it&#39;s really hard for <br/>\nhim. They even put him in 3rd (he&#39;s supposed to be in 4th) because of <br/>\nhis handwriting and they give the MEAPs in 4th and there are essays <br/>\nto write and I think they thought he&#39;d bring thier curve down. Anyway <br/>\nin the last couple of monthes he&#39;s started to lie to me about what he <br/>\nhas to get done and homework. This bothers me most of all. He never <br/>\nhad to lie to me before. This morning I got a call from the principal <br/>\nas soon as I got home from dropping him off. She said he was in her <br/>\noffice because he wasn&#39;t finshing his work in class or doing his <br/>\nhomework. She said he was going to stay there until he finished and <br/>\nthen he could go to class. If it was just up to me I would of taken <br/>\nhim out months ago but my husband wants him to finish the school <br/>\nyear. My husband doesn&#39;t get unschooling even though I try and show <br/>\nhim. He thinks you have to go to school to learn what they teach and <br/>\nI&#39;m the total opposite.I see it everyday with Chris when he&#39;s not in <br/>\nschool and his brother Colt who&#39;s 4. I just don&#39;t know what to do. <br/>\nIt&#39;s going against my grain to make Chris do these things. I can&#39;t <br/>\nreally back up a teacher or principal if I don&#39;t believe in what <br/>\ntheir doing. This is all so stressful on Chris too that he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlearn anything anyway. I guess after all this I&#39;m just looking for <br/>\nsome advice or works of encouragement. I think it&#39;s going to be a <br/>\nrough day for everybody.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nLori in MI</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104242,"nextTopicId":104396}}
