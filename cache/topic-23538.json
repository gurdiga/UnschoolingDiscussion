(or any teacher) Teachers are paid to teach, if kids can learn on<br/>\ntheir own then teachers aren&#39;t needed in the same capacity. You see teachers<br/>\nhave to teach the curriculum to the kids because it is being introduced<br/>\nbefore the child is ready. The mentality of the school seems to be &quot;teach<br/>\nthem now so when they need it they already know it&quot;. However, the heart of<br/>\nthe unschooler is when they need it, they will learn it. Once a child<br/>\nrealizes they need it they learn it very quickly. While in school, however,<br/>\nthey are being forced to learn something they do not need and so it takes<br/>\nmuch longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI apologize if I just confused everyone!
