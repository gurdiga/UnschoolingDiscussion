From <br/>\nabout 1 year old, the kids were helping out when I was cleaning up their <br/>\nstuff. Helping with just probably one toy but walking along with me and <br/>\nputting it where it belonged. If they didn&#39;t want to, then I would just do <br/>\nit all myself. Just doing that, the kids got very use to putting their stuff <br/>\naway. When they have left it out, they understood what would happen. (the <br/>\ndog would eat it, their sister would take it and misplace it or they would <br/>\nmisplace it themselves) They learned it was much better and actually easier <br/>\nto clean up daily. Now it&#39;s really no problem. I suggest how about a clean <br/>\nup time now and they either ask if they can wait until they&#39;re done doing <br/>\nwhatever or start doing it. If they have something else they want to do, no <br/>\nproblem, they just clean up later. I&#39;m not nuts about getting it done now or <br/>\nwhen I say. Just so it&#39;s done before we start another day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two middle kids pick up after the baby. I also pick up the babies things <br/>\ntoo. At 2 years old, she&#39;s not there yet to put everything away. The kids <br/>\nwill help with no problem. Usually when she sees them, she pitches in and <br/>\nhelps too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we have our clean times twice a year, I just tell the kids that the <br/>\nchurch is having their sale and we should try to donate some stuff. I do <br/>\nthis a couple of weeks ahead of time so if no one feels like it we have time <br/>\nthe next week. The kids are usually up for it as they know we are doing <br/>\nsomething good for the church and they actually like to clean out there <br/>\nstuff. Makes room for new stuff! &lt;BG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMu husband is a different story. He&#39;s awful and saves everything. Little <br/>\nbits of paper that came from God knows where. I ask for a couple of weeks <br/>\nuntil I can&#39;t stand it any longer. Then I start stacking stuff. He&#39;s <br/>\nespecially bad with papers and receipts and stuff. At least stacking makes <br/>\nit easier for me to look at. After a few weeks of stacking, if it&#39;s still <br/>\nthere, I bag or box it and put it in the closet. If it&#39;s in there long <br/>\nenough to bother me, I just sy I&#39;m throwing it out. If it&#39;s there that long <br/>\nand he hasn&#39;t needed it, chances are it&#39;s useless. I do that with his <br/>\nclothes too. I say I&#39;m cleaning out his closet for the church. He doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant me throwing out a favorite holey shirt so he sort through it on his <br/>\nown. Same with the papers. If he knows I&#39;m pitching it out, he takes care of <br/>\nit. We still have one bag and one box in the closet that&#39;s out of the way <br/>\nand I&#39;m okay with it. He tries, or at least say he does, but neatness just <br/>\nisn&#39;t in him!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nInternet access plans that fit your lifestyle -- join MSN. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/default.asp\">http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/default.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] House cleaning","postDate":"1034967869","msgId":46806,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY0M2lwNjhWOHpEdjYwZ3hhcHowMDAwNjFlYUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":46801,"nextInTopic":46807,"prevInTime":46805,"nextInTime":46807,"topicId":46779,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I almost anal about it, although between <br/>\nmy husband and 4 kids, I&#39;ve learned to loosen up a bit. But at any time, you <br/>\ncan come into my house and see it all neat and clean. My house is pretty big <br/>\nbut I have no system or days that I do certain things. My kids put away <br/>\ntheir clothes, toys and keep their rooms neat. I do the cleaning, although <br/>\nmy oldest keeps the kids&#39; bathroom cleaned. I do laundry every day, vacuum <br/>\nevery day and mop the floors every day. The kitchen is also cleaned every <br/>\nday. The dusting and bathrooms are done every couple days. I do fans about <br/>\nonce a month. Every now and then I go around with my cleaner doing doors and <br/>\nwalls. I clean out all things not used, worn or played with twice a year. <br/>\nOnce in Oct. and once in June. That coincides with our church bazaar where I <br/>\ndonate the stuff. I also clean the carpets in the living room and computer <br/>\nroom every 6-8 weeks. The bedrooms get done at least once a year if not <br/>\nmore. I have a carpet cleaner machine myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cleaning that I do is around the whole house except for my oldest&#39;s <br/>\nroom. She cleans it herself. I do all the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery night the playroom gets cleaned up as far as stuff on the floor. If we <br/>\nare going out for the day, the playroom gets picked up then too. It was a <br/>\nnecessity when the baby was little and crawling and walking around. Now it&#39;s <br/>\nalso necessary because we have 2 dogs and one is still in the puppy chewing <br/>\npicking up everything in his mouth stage. Although he&#39;s not out through the <br/>\nwhole house yet, he&#39;s quick!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls room doesn&#39;t get that messy as they mostly play in the playroom or <br/>\nmy sons room. My oldest keeps her room great except for the bed. It&#39;s almost <br/>\nalways scrumpled with blankets. I close the door! My son&#39;s room is a bit <br/>\nscattered as he takes after his dad! Saves everything and spreads it all <br/>\naround. His room was an add on and is in the back of the house on the other <br/>\nside of the playroom. Even with the door open, you can&#39;t see in. I suggest <br/>\nevery few days that he tidy up so he&#39;s doesn&#39;t get so overwhelmed by it when <br/>\nhe does want to put things back. He&#39;s been real good about keeping on top of <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only real problem in the house is my husband!! He&#39;s terrible about not <br/>\nputting anything back where he found it after using it. That&#39;s the key to <br/>\nkeeping neat. Use it and put it back. He&#39;ll pull out the phone book and I&#39;ll <br/>\nfind it wide open on the desk a foot away from the drawer where it belongs. <br/>\nHe&#39;s impossible and I&#39;m top of him more than anything. ( pun intended!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s important to get rid of anything not used and then clean a <br/>\nlittle every day. Saving things for certain days just doesn&#39;t work when <br/>\nthings come up and waiting for weekends can get overwhelming.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I&#39;m very anal about cleaning but that&#39;s just a part of who I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChoose an Internet access plan right for you -- try MSN! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/default.asp\">http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/default.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deborah Lewis","from":"Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] House cleaning","postDate":"1034959332","msgId":46794,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDE4LjEwNDIxMi44OTYuMi5kZHppbWxld0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":46791,"nextInTopic":46796,"prevInTime":46793,"nextInTime":46795,"topicId":46779,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Rachel Ann, your post made me smile.

I do the essential stuff and the rest gets taken care on<br/>\nalong the way when one or the other of us has the time and inclination to<br/>\ndo it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI did ask my husband to build some book shelves.

After the<br/>\nlaughter died down I did notice plans for a bookshelf on his workbench.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI find lots of books at garage sales and second hand stores and I usually<br/>\npass those on after a while.  There is a new web site, game kind of<br/>\nthing, I think it&#39;s called bookcrossings, and you release books into the<br/>\nwild and they&#39;re tracked on the web site to see where they go.  It&#39;s<br/>\nsilly, but it&#39;s probably motivating a few people to clean off their<br/>\nshelves.

Sometimes if it becomes that way, it <br/>\nmeans the kids are just too tired and we bag it for the night. <br/>\n<br/>\nDitto with keeping things picked up during the day. The kids are <br/>\npretty good about doing it, but sometimes they forget and I just <br/>\nremind them. Natural consequences usually enforce this stuff pretty <br/>\nwell too. Like if we&#39;re getting ready to go somewhere, and my son <br/>\ncan&#39;t find his shoes, we&#39;ll maybe have a discussion about how if we <br/>\nkeep the shoes in the shoe rack, then we can find them when we need <br/>\nthem. Same goes for if I can&#39;t find my shoes either :-). There have <br/>\nbeen many times that toys can&#39;t be found, and so it has become pretty <br/>\nclear over time that it is useful to keep them in their receptive <br/>\nbins, so that when you absolutely *must* play with the blue batman, <br/>\nyou know exactly where he is.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10294444,"authorName":"Myranda","from":"&quot;Myranda&quot; &lt;myrandab@...&gt;","profile":"randascloudream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: House cleaning","postDate":"1034958240","msgId":46789,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyNzQwMWMyNzZjMiRjNWQxZjcwMCQwMTNmZmVhOUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGFvcGFuais1bHNxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDEwZDAxYzI3NmMwJDhkOTI1MGQwJDBlODk1MjQzQEFub2xpY2tGYW1pbHk+"},"prevInTopic":46786,"nextInTopic":46791,"prevInTime":46788,"nextInTime":46790,"topicId":46779,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ah, ok!

First of all, I&#39;m a big <br/>\nbeliever in having some sort of system. FlyLady is very good, or <br/>\nwhatever works for you. We have a cleaning chart that has the tasks <br/>\nfor each day. Most of them only take a few moments to complete. Like <br/>\non Mondays, we clean all the bathrooms - counters, toilets, etc. The <br/>\nkids help. Because we do it every week, it&#39;s basically a wipe-down. <br/>\nNothing ever gets very yucky. Much more pleasant than the &quot;muck-it-<br/>\nout when company is on its way&quot; approach that I grew up with. <br/>\nTuesdays we vacuum, Wednesdays we scrub down the kitchen, etc. Then <br/>\ndaily we do things like laundry, dishes, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt nighttime before the kids go to sleep, we all pick up whatever has <br/>\nbeen brought out for the day. Coats get hung up, clothes go into the <br/>\nlaundry bins, books and toys are put away. Again, doing this every <br/>\nnight means that no-one has an enormous mess to clean up. If the kids <br/>\nare working on some sort of project or have a fort put up that they <br/>\nwant to play with the next day, we don&#39;t insist that it gets put up, <br/>\nof course. Just the general mess. Some nights we don&#39;t manage to do <br/>\nthis, and I either clean up after the kids go to bed, or I ignore it <br/>\nuntil the next day, but generally the house stays relatively clean <br/>\nand picked up. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for toy organization, we have baskets and bins. A table for all <br/>\nthe legos (old train table), a big basket for dressup stuff, small <br/>\nbasket for puppets, small bins for Hot Wheels cars, action figures, <br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMainly, keeping things clean is just getting in the habit of putting <br/>\nthings back in their places. If they don&#39;t have a consistent place, <br/>\nmake one or get rid of the item. When you finish with breakfast, the <br/>\ndishes go in the dishwasher and the counter gets wiped down. When we <br/>\nread some books, they go back to the bookshelf. Our shoes go into the <br/>\nshoe rack when we enter the house. That way, the nightly pickup is <br/>\njust a quick routine. The kids don&#39;t feel overly fettered by any of <br/>\nthese routines. In fact, I think it&#39;s much easier on them than my own <br/>\nmom&#39;s own method of ignoring the mess, then doing panic cleanups <br/>\nwhenever there was company coming or a special occasion. We all feel <br/>\nso much more relaxed in a house that&#39;s fairly uncluttered and <br/>\nrelatively clean. We wouldn&#39;t pass any white glove tests, but overall <br/>\nI think we&#39;ve found a good balance. I&#39;ll also add that in the summer <br/>\ntime we are much more relaxed as we are almost always out of the <br/>\nhouse until bedtime, enjoying the good weather. So we have to get <br/>\nback in the evening pickup routine when autumn arrives.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my advice, for whatever it is worth is to:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Find a routine and stick with it<br/>\n- Get in the habit of putting away whatever you get out, cleaning up <br/>\nwhat gets spilled, etc.<br/>\n- Find a place for things so that there aren&#39;t items that just have <br/>\nnowhere to go<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, I have to admit that my own desk is rather a <br/>\nmess. That&#39;s the last holdover from the poor cleaning skills I had <br/>\nover most of my life. I&#39;m working on that one. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10294444,"authorName":"Myranda","from":"&quot;Myranda&quot; &lt;myrandab@...&gt;","profile":"randascloudream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] House cleaning","postDate":"1034955185","msgId":46783,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxZWYwMWMyNzZiYiRhODdmYjlhMCQwMTNmZmVhOUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDEyNi4xODhmYzAwMC4yYWUxNzQ5MEBhb2wuY29tPiA8MDBjOTAxYzI3NmI0JDhkYjczNDYwJDBlODk1MjQzQEFub2xpY2tGYW1pbHk+"},"prevInTopic":46780,"nextInTopic":46785,"prevInTime":46782,"nextInTime":46784,"topicId":46779,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"OMG, do you ever sound like I used to be!!!

When I got pregnant this last time, I knew we had to get better or the poor thing would choke to death the first day on the floor! Between lego&#39;s, marbles, books, toys, clothes, craft supplies, game pieces, and so on, more things were on the floor than anywhere else. Didn&#39;t help that I had a hubby who could scatter enough trash around the house each day that would fill a trash bag, not to mention he didn&#39;t know what a dirty clothes hamper was for. I&#39;d spend an entire weekend each month doing nothing but cleaning. <br/>\n<br/>\nI, too, did the FlyLady for about a month - got rid of all our old clothes no one was gonna wear again, card games with half the cards missing or torn, markers and pens that didn&#39;t write, all the extra pots and pans I hadn&#39;t used in years, and a bunch of stuffed animals that had been bagged up for years. I had the boys go thru their toys, and DH go thru his tools and other junk and we had a yardsale. I went thru all the little lamps and knick-knacks I&#39;d been collecting, too. Threw out most of the stuff in the kitchen junk-drawer. I think I hauled off two car-loads of junk. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen..... I put up shelves!!!! Everywhere! Each of the boys got a big bookshelf, the living room got a bookshelf, and my room got two bookshelves. I painted and nailed up shelves in the bathrooms, laundry room, and closets. All our videos and computer games went on the bookshelf in the living room, and on a shelf over the TV I put all of my dolls. A shelf in the kitchen held all my spices that always ended up around the stove. The boys divided up the games and books and filled their bookshelves with them. Bath stuff (washrags, extra toilet paper) got put on bathroom shelves, hooks on the end held towels. All the laundry stuff went on the shelf in the laundry room, and paint and tools went on another shelf in there. My books went on one bookshelf in my room, and the other was for knick-nacks. Small shelves in the living room held plants and the boys&#39; art projects. Shelves in the closets held shoes and other junk that just seems to end up in the closet. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also bought an extra small dresser for each bedroom to keep papers and collectibles in. Don&#39;t know where to put it? Put it in the dresser. Each bedroom also got one of those mesh corner stuffed-animal holders for the animals and other light-weight toys that didn&#39;t fit in toyboxes. DH built a big box that holds all the lego&#39;s. The bathrooms got small mesh net toy-holders with suction cups to hold the bath toys. I got rid of the clutter of the shampoo and bath gel bottles by getting some of those wall-mounted shampoo/soap holder/dispenser thingys. Two dual ones for each bathroom - one for shampoo and conditioner, one for hand soap and bath gel. Another dual one for the kitchen - one for dish soap, one for hand soap. I threw out all my cleaning supplies and bought one big spray bottle to put my Critis Magic cleaner in, plus one scrub brush. Oh, and those stackable baskets are on each bathroom counter and under the counters too. Things like toothpaste, hair stuff, band-aids, etc go in these baskets. They&#39;re jumbled, but with small baskets, you don&#39;t have to dig much to find anything. <br/>\n<br/>\nTrash cans in each room, and two in the living room have helped get rid of unwanted junk that anyone may be relunctant to walk to the kitchen to get rid of. <br/>\n<br/>\nI started vaccuming every morning, and DH cleans the kitchen every Saturday and Wednesday evening, and sweeps it every evening. He takes off whatever trash we have every morning on his way to work. The boys clean their rooms every Saturday, and alternate cleaning their bathroom each day. I go thru the living room every evening, and put things that belong to each person in their own basket, and that person puts the stuff away each night before bed. <br/>\n<br/>\nLaundry gets done one load every day while I&#39;m cooking lunch - everyone&#39;s clothes get put on their bed to fold and put up. Also bought a magazine rack - when it gets full, it gets weeded out. A coat rack by the front door catches coats, sweaters, umbrellas, and hats. Box by the fireplace for newspapers. Box by the front door for library books, shopping lists, whatever may need to go with us when we leave. Shoes are taken off when we walk in and put on the mat underneath the coat rack. <br/>\n<br/>\nBrett has the job to wipe down the kitchen table after each meal. Tyler has the job of rinsing out and refilling the cat&#39;s water each day. <br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm I think that&#39;s about it. I now spend about one day every-other month cleaning everything, and it only takes about a half-hour per room, less for the smaller rooms. Having places to put things really makes a huge difference!!! Getting into a routine was the hardest part for me, and it took a good three months to do it, but now it&#39;s so much easier! I don&#39;t even have to think about it anymore, and nothing takes more than 5-10 minutes to do. HTH!<br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n <br/>\n  First, I want to declare, right here and now, that I am not, nor ever have been a neatnik.
