They do pretty <br/>\nwell being quiet, but every now and then one of us will need to pop in and <br/>\ndo a quick quiet-request.  Once dh had to remind *me* to be quiet... how <br/>\nembarrassing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe dropped the bedtimes a few years ago (more or less) and I&#39;ve found it&#39;s <br/>\nlovely.  The kids go to bed when they&#39;re tired and they&#39;re more pleasant to <br/>\nbe around as they&#39;re not busy thinking up reasons for why they should be <br/>\nable to stay up longer, or wondering when &quot;The Law&quot; is going to slam down <br/>\nand send them off to bed. (grin)<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, after 11:30 or so, my 13 year old son and I worked on a 1500 <br/>\npiece puzzle, looked up Boticelli in one of my old college books and <br/>\nonline, learned about Zephyrs, the three muses, the  nymph Cloris, Flora <br/>\n(goddess of fecundity!), Venus (of course) and Mercury who was using his <br/>\ncaducea to stir the heavens, which sent ds to the dictionary to find out <br/>\nwhat that word meant, only it wasn&#39;t in there, but similar words were, so <br/>\nhe figured out what the word meant and how other similar words could be <br/>\nused to define a word we don&#39;t know, etc.  ...then he sought out Mercury in <br/>\nthe dictionary and told me all about him too  ...then my son, who has never <br/>\nmuch enjoyed reading, read to me from &#39;The Worlds Shortest Short Stories&#39; <br/>\n(or similar.)  I finally drifted off to bed while he puttered around.

In bed between 9 and 10, and up at 5 for work.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nnoticed that when the kids are playing by themselves and I&#39;m doing my <br/>\nown thing, they&#39;re much more likely to be loud and wake up dh.  When <br/>\nI&#39;m actively playing with them, they are much more likely to be quiet <br/>\nenough. My presence tends to keep things more quiet and them less <br/>\nlikely to fight loudly with each other.     &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy pattern is years&#39; long, but I often stay up until Holly&#39;s asleep, and when <br/>\nthe boys were younger I stayed up with them too.  Now that they&#39;re teens, <br/>\nthey can stay up on their own.  But the deal has always been &quot;You can stay up <br/>\nif you can be quiet.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not even a rule, because it&#39;s just courtesy.<br/>\nIt IS a condition of the privilege of choosing one&#39;s bedtime here, though, <br/>\nthat they need to be quiet.  And then in the morning those who get up <br/>\nreciprocate by being quiet until noon.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids are used to rules, it&#39;s hard for parents to believe that kids will <br/>\nbe courteous on their own.  But my kids wouldn&#39;t dream of trying to justify <br/>\nhaving made enough noise to disturb someone&#39;s sleep.  We&#39;re sweet to them and <br/>\nthey&#39;re sweet to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think a family could just declare that and have it happen one day.  <br/>\nIt was gradual.  But it&#39;s valuable and working wonderfully here.  Lots of <br/>\ntheir learning has always happened near bedtime, and even tonight, with Holly <br/>\nbeing the only one here, the half hour before she went to bed was really <br/>\nbusy, mentally, and she and I reviewed the day and some ideas, and I told her <br/>\nI wished she could be a baby once in a while, maybe once a week, long enough <br/>\nfor me to carry her around and rock her to sleep.  And she smiled and hugged <br/>\nme, and told me some stories about people saying she was tall this week, and <br/>\nfeeling big.  She put in a Land Before Time video we went and rented this <br/>\nevening (saw another homeschooling mom at the video store, too), and went to <br/>\nbed peaceful and happy, when she wanted to, and where she wanted to.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had other kids spend the night Friday.  They said they usually have to go <br/>\nto bed at 9:00, sometimes 8:00.  Holly told them it was sometimes still LIGHT <br/>\nat 8:00, and they just shrugged.  She talked to me about that some more <br/>\ntoday, about how very early that is, and how it&#39;s purely for the parents&#39; <br/>\nbenefit and not for the kids.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they were here, they and Holly all went to bed around midnight, very <br/>\nhappily.  Two got up about 8:30, and the other two at 10:30.  All smiling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58724,"nextTopicId":59042}}
