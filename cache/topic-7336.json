I am keenly aware of the potential problems ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-998686443\">Hi Karen;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know lately there has been considerable discussion regarding the many <br/>\npitfalls of television.  I am keenly aware of the potential problems<br/>\nassociated with too much or inappropriate television viewing but I am<br/>\nputting forward my voice in favour of supervised and<br/>\nintelligently-managed TV.  I know when I grew up in the &#39;60&#39;s and &#39;70&#39;s<br/>\nmy parents were VERY strict with my siblings and me with TV.  I learned<br/>\nfrom that.  I am very pleased to see the amount and extent of<br/>\neducational and informative programming that exists today.  When I was a<br/>\nkid &quot;good TV&quot; was pretty much restricted to Jacque Cousteau specials. <br/>\nOur family entertainment budget is spent on attending the occasional<br/>\nBallet or Symphony performance and cable hook-up.  Thankfully in my city<br/>\nwe have an EXCELLENT library program and our weekly visits to the local<br/>\nlibrary involve free rentals of choice videos.  Our family takes full<br/>\nadvantage of PBS programming (my science component on our unschooling<br/>\nbasically revolves around Magic School Bus and Bill Nye the Science Guy.<br/>\nKratt&#39;s Kreatures is another great program and we are regular viewers of<br/>\nthe Discovery/Learning/History channels. It&#39;s also unbelievable what my<br/>\nkids have picked up geography/anthropology/social studies-wise with the<br/>\nFood Network!!!  So my kids do watch a couple of hours of TV every day. <br/>\nAnd I think it has been extremely valuable.  Often their curiosity has<br/>\nbeen perked by some subject from a program they&#39;ve seen and we follow up<br/>\nwith research at the library thereafter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs well, we do have books galore, art supplies and various recycled<br/>\nmaterials about the house that the kids have an outlet when the creative<br/>\njuices flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think every homeschooling family has an individual resource that makes<br/>\ntheir situation unique.  I know of at least a half dozen professional<br/>\nteachers who unschool and obviously they have a talent their children<br/>\ncan benefit from.  I am a freelance photographer and get an assignment<br/>\nevery couple of weeks.  I&#39;ve been very fortunate to bring my children<br/>\nalong on just about every assignment and as a result they have been<br/>\nexposed to every imaginable individual in the community. They are now<br/>\n10yr, 7yr and 18mo.  They&#39;ve met artists, inventors, scientists,<br/>\nnewsmakers, celebrities, authors, sports personalities, younameit.  I<br/>\nthink that experience alone is enough to give them a well-rounded<br/>\neducational background and get them thinking about what intrigues and<br/>\nstimulates them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I haven&#39;t bored you with too much information about us!<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia in Saskatoon, Canada  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HPaulson5@...\">HPaulson5@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HPaulson5@...\">HPaulson5@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Teri,  Congratulations to you and your kids on a job very well done!

At this time I let them watch<br/>\n&gt; a show (usually PBS) in the morning, and one after their bath at night.<br/>\n&gt; There are times that they may end up watching something in the afternoon, but<br/>\n&gt; I try to keep  the set off as much as possible; I do not want them &quot;vegging<br/>\n&gt; out&quot; and staring at the set like zombies  :) .  This is difficult some days,<br/>\n&gt; especially if the weather is bad, or if I am not feeling well, or if the baby<br/>\n&gt; is especially cranky.  I would like to hear from others how they handle the<br/>\n&gt; tv issue.   Also, I know there are really no two famillies that unschool<br/>\n&gt; alike, but  since I have not been at this for very long, I would love to hear<br/>\n&gt; how other families &quot;do it&quot;-- what kinds of things do you do on any given day,<br/>\n&gt; and how you engage your kids.  For example, do some of you leave materials<br/>\n&gt; around  for your kids to &quot;discover&quot;? Do you blend a bit of homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; structure into your unschooling?  I don&#39;t mean to be nosy and invasive, I am<br/>\n&gt; just extremely interested in this,  and since I used to teach elem. school,<br/>\n&gt; there are times I feel that I struggle with having the child decide when and<br/>\n&gt; if he will learn something.  I am working on this, though, but could use some<br/>\n&gt; guidance from you &quot;experts&quot; on this list!!!

Last Friday, my children did an act in<br/>\n&gt; the Oregon homeschoolers Talent show. They are 9 and 10. My daughter was<br/>\n&gt; scared to death, even cried before the show. (they are clowns) They have been<br/>\n&gt; training the last year with a professional clown. I was not going to force<br/>\n&gt; her to do the show, but I just behave calmly, like nerves are a part of<br/>\n&gt; performing, which they are. Her brother was ready to go on and would have<br/>\n&gt; been crushed had she decided not to. Plus, I knew she would have been<br/>\n&gt; disappointed in herself if she hadn&#39;t. Well, they did it and the Triumphed!<br/>\n&gt; (it wasn&#39;t a competition) But they were flawless... I was so proud of both of<br/>\n&gt; them, but to be afraid like that then with a lift of the chin, do it<br/>\n&gt; beautifully!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then today, I got up early to write and by 11 I couldn&#39;t stand it anymore. I<br/>\n&gt; went to bed and left the instructions that they could work on any type of<br/>\n&gt; project they liked but had to clean the mess and no TV. I wondered briefly<br/>\n&gt; what kind of shape the house would be in.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I woke to the smell of Chocolate chip cookies. Upon sleepy investigation, I<br/>\n&gt; realized that they had not only baked the cookies(perfectly) but had cleaned<br/>\n&gt; the mess and the living room! WOW!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am so proud of them, they used problem solving skills, cooperation,<br/>\n&gt; reading, math, and basic living skills, all without a single worksheet nor<br/>\n&gt; any direction or cohersion from me:) LOL<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tooo cooool!<br/>\n&gt; Teri<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt; Teri Brown<br/>\n&gt; Suite101 Unschooling Editor<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.suite101.com/welcome.cfm/unschooling\">http://www.suite101.com/welcome.cfm/unschooling</a><br/>\n&gt; Assistant Editor For Voices,<br/>\n&gt; The Journal of the National Home Education Network www.nhen.org<br/>\n&gt; Columnist For The Link: A Homeschooling Newspaper<br/>\n&gt; Homeschooling - Christian Unschooling - Natural learning<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.inspirit.com.au/unschooling/\">http://www.inspirit.com.au/unschooling/</a><br/>\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; PERFORM CPR ON YOUR APR!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!

You&#39;ve hit a nerve here  :-)  I used to be one of the &quot;kill<br/>\nyour tv&quot; types. Where we used to live we got two channels without any cable,<br/>\nand one of them was KCTS. Fine, they watch a couple shows a day, maybe a<br/>\nmovie thrown in there. They&#39;ve never been the kind of children that just sit<br/>\nand do nothing for hours on end because they are watching the tv. Then,<br/>\nafter we got up to our new house and realized that you get NO reception here<br/>\nwithout a huge antennae on your house or cable, we subscribed to cable. It<br/>\nwas so overwhelming at first, I cancelled it. No channels. The kids voiced<br/>\nthat they really did wish to see some of the shows they used to like. One of<br/>\nthem being a nature show, another being a KCTS show, just really neat things<br/>\nthat they wanted to see. SO, I got the cable hooked back up, and they do<br/>\nfine with it. I have always monitored what they watch, as well as how long<br/>\nthey watch it for, and now when the show they want to watch is over, they<br/>\nwill just get up and turn off the tv. I just love it when they do that, I<br/>\nthink they have learned control and moderation.  I&#39;ve asked for so much<br/>\nadvice on this, and tried different &#39;things&#39; to really make an issue out of<br/>\nregulating the tv, but my kids LOVE to read and will read for HOURS on end,<br/>\nand play and work in their garden and do so many other things that I just<br/>\ndon&#39;t see the tv as being a problem anymore.
