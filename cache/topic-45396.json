He is so happy and joyful, and it is the simplest thing <br/>\nto do.  I feel so grateful that I can do that little thing for him and see <br/>\nhim be so happy!  It has always been that way, and I know that one day it <br/>\nwon&#39;t be.  One day, he&#39;ll probably get himself off to bed (hard to <br/>\nimagine!) and he won&#39;t wiggle and squirm with joy to be next to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Marji - <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is such a great reminder to me as I am in the &quot;snuggle me&quot; stage. Sometimes it does cause inconvience as I am going to college, running a home business etc. that make night time a good time to sit and work. I hate to admit this but more often than not in the last 5 weeks since school started up for me again said No to the snuggling because I had to get work done.  Boy - is that crazy or what?? It&#39;s like those Hallmark commercials where the kids keeps asking the busy parent for the book and they keep saying &quot;in a minute&quot; the minute never comes so there they are buying this Hallmark card to make up for it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8 dd and I are reading the Secret Garden together. You know how many times she has begged for &quot;just one more chapter&quot;  Most often I do indulge - but there are evenings where I am less than congenial about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is the thing you reminded me of Marji - It will all come to an end to quickly and my teenagers won&#39;t be begging me to snuggle them and I will have the time to do this... so I have to do it now ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nheather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45343,"nextTopicId":45358}}
