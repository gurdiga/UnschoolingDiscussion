Nobody cooks all day, everyone helps clean up, and we sit around talking and munching cookies and chocolates and playing with the kids&#39; toys.<br/>\n<br/>\nJanet<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: An After Xmas Thought","postDate":"1104153540","msgId":101782,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNxcDI0NCtyNDhrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTUtREFWMTQ0RTg3RjczMkVGNUMyMDFFMzBCOEQ4OTkwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":101781,"nextInTopic":101784,"prevInTime":101781,"nextInTime":101783,"topicId":101764,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... just spent the past two days cooking, cleaning, taking care of the kids and doing it all over again as tons of folks came by for Xmas visits, food, and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1639034784\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Elisa Tauraso&quot; <br/>\n&lt;elisatauraso@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Wow!

Does anyone else feel like I <br/>\ndo?    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband and I share the chores, and Will does some of them, too.   When <br/>\nthe older boys were home, we all cleaned the house (me giving them specific  <br/>\ntasks I knew they were willing to do), and Charles and I shared the cooking. It  <br/>\nseems like we all know what needs to be done to get ready for guests, and they <br/>\n all pitch in, knowing I&#39;m going to ask them to help, anyway.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThis year Charles happened to do most of the clean up while I sat in the  <br/>\nliving room with my parents and my son before he leaves for Iraq on the  10th.   <br/>\nWe shared the cooking as usual.  I made a list of  what we needed to make, and <br/>\nwe just got started.  In fact, when my dad  asked who to compliment about the <br/>\ngravy, Charles and I had to think  back through what we did to figure out who <br/>\nmade it. We didn&#39;t plan it  that way or negotiate it.  It just happened.   <br/>\nAfter dinner I was  more interested in being with the family and letting the <br/>\ndishes wait, and he was  more interested in listening from the kitchen while <br/>\ngetting the dishes  done.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOne thing I know is true about me.  I don&#39;t have any ownership over  the <br/>\ndishes!  I don&#39;t care who does them, and I don&#39;t care if the kitchen is  cleaned <br/>\nup before I sit down to chat.  I&#39;d much rather spend my time with  my family <br/>\nand doing other things than cleaning up.  Housework can  WAIT!  I know that <br/>\nsometimes doing the dishes and putting the food away can  be a social event, too.  <br/>\nIt didn&#39;t work out that way this year.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t rush around all the time prior to Christmas getting things  <br/>\nready.  Will and I decorated the tree together, and the housework got done  <br/>\npiecemeal.  I usually take one day before Christmas where I farm out the  kids (Will <br/>\nis the only one left) for a play day or a day with Gram, and I spend  that day <br/>\nwrapping presents, cleaning off my desk, taking me time, going in the  stores <br/>\nWill hates to go in, or whatever.  It feels more like rushing if I  have to <br/>\ndo all that stuff while taking care of the kids.  So I save all the  tasks I <br/>\nknow I&#39;d rather do alone for whatever reason for that day.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI say holidays are a family affair and the whole family should be  involved.  <br/>\nMom should let go of the ownership of it, and get dad at least  to pitch in.  <br/>\nCertainly ask for help.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162967824,"authorName":"Dawn Adams","from":"&quot;Dawn Adams&quot; &lt;Wishbone@...&gt;","profile":"bluenosegoddess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] An After Xmas Thought","postDate":"1104150837","msgId":101780,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjIwMWM0ZWMxMyQ2NTlkZjE0MCQ5NzRjZGUxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTUtREFWMTQ0RTg3RjczMkVGNUMyMDFFMzBCOEQ4OTkwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":101776,"nextInTopic":101781,"prevInTime":101779,"nextInTime":101781,"topicId":101764,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We did a &quot;big&quot; Christmas meal, I guess - we had beef wellington, cheese frosted cauliflower, mashed potatoes, and &quot;heavenly carrots&quot; (carrots in brown sugar and butter). We got a Trader Joe&#39;s chocolate torte for dessert. Everyone got what they wanted, really. My dad took my grandma to church and then brought her over, my sister came over early and we did dinner together, and Rain alternated between helping with the cooking and chatting with her great grandma. She did the mashed potatoes herself...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beef was the only hard part. We started it and the whole oven started to smoke (leftover pizza drips, says my dad) so we had to stop, turn it off, take out the meat, over the windows and doors, and clean it off as best we could (later I demonstrated how his self-cleaning oven worked - he was widowed 3 years ago and it had been at least that long). Then we realized that my dad only had self-rising flour, instead of all-purpose, so my sister went on a quick trip to the grocery store. The crust part was difficult, and I had to make more crust mix as my sister tried to cover the meat with it... but we laughed a lot and it was kind of a fun bonding thing. Dinner was an hour late, but no one minded. My did served drinks and munchies, my grandma drank a few glasses of wine and told Rain lots of old stories, and even some new ones (she also forgot it was Christmas, which was a little worrisome - she&#39;s 91 and the nursing home looms). It was a communal effort, and even though I was nominally in charge of dinner, it didn&#39;t feel like a huge thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think it could have been stressful, but we all have a pretty easy-going attitude. Rain doesn&#39;t eat red meat, but she was fine with the other stuff. I&#39;ve never cooked any beef that cost $13 a pound, so I was slightly worried that I would ruin $35 worth of meat, but it was really good.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfterwards we did my grandma&#39;s gifts with her (we opened ours earlier) and hung out. Later my dad drove her home and I did some dishes, and that evening my dad and I did the rest of the dishes, then drove to Winterhaven and walked around and looked at lights.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a small get-together, really, because my brother is a TI and couldn&#39;t come home (although he called from San Antonio). We really had 5 different generations going - my grandma (91), my dad (61), me (36), my sister (24), and Rain (almost 12). Okay, 4 generations and a half-step in the middle. No small children, although my grandma needed pretty constant attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings are more stressful in the kitchen when my dad&#39;s girlfriend is around, because she doesn&#39;t take minor disasters in stride very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\nIn a message dated 12/26/04 7:48:38 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elisatauraso@...\">elisatauraso@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I&#39;m beginning to wonder if all this passing on the tradition of the Mom <br/>\nmaking a huge Xmas meal is really worth it?

Christmas morning, santa came, and then dinner <br/>\nwas served around 3p. But we do a buffett, so it mostly involved <br/>\nheating up the ham and the lasangna, opening cans of stuff and <br/>\nheating it up, and then everyone serves themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only real hard part was that i ended up staying up really late <br/>\nthurs night making chocolate chip cookies (shouldve made the dough <br/>\nearlier), and lasangna (which is better if it sits overnight at <br/>\nleast), and then stayed up really late friday night helping santa <br/>\nwrap presents.

Holidays, or any kind of event for us is sharing it<br/>\nall together. That&#39;s what makes it fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristmas eve we have our own tradition of eating take out. This year it was<br/>\nChinese. Joe and the 2 younger girls cleaned up the kitchen while I wrapped<br/>\npresents. The kids are showered early, Tara goes with her dads family for<br/>\nthe eve and comes home later. Joe and I and the 3 kids here bake cookies and<br/>\nwatch a movie. This year it was Elf. My pot of sauce gets made in the<br/>\nevening for the next day and that&#39;s a sure sign, or smell that Christmas is<br/>\non it&#39;s way. We snack and enjoy the evening and the kids head to bed around<br/>\nmidnight. That&#39;s when Joe and I take out all the gifts and place them under<br/>\nand around the tree.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristmas day doesn&#39;t start very early. I think this year it was around 9.<br/>\nJoe goes and gets donuts while the kids run around waking everyone up. This<br/>\nyear the 3 younger ones were running around the house all excited and my<br/>\noldest stumbles out of her room, still sleepy because the kids woke her and<br/>\nmumbles &quot;Ah, to be young again!!!!&quot; She&#39;s not quite yet 19!!! LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter opening the gifts the turkey gets put in. We spend about the next hour<br/>\ntaking the kids toys out of the impossible boxes they pack them in these<br/>\ndays. It&#39;s a day where we all sit around and play. I may stuff some<br/>\nmushrooms and put the sauce on but mostly we all just relax. Some cousins<br/>\nand other family come later in the afternoon and it&#39;s still all relaxed. I<br/>\nmake sure the food is all easy do ahead or not time consuming. I enjoy the<br/>\nday just as much as everyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had our homeschooling group party here this year again. 15 adults and 23<br/>\nkids. I enjoyed that party too. Some of us made some food and we ordered<br/>\nsome platters from the grocery store. All very easy. I&#39;m a good hostess, but<br/>\nI always want to be a fun one too!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] An After Xmas Thought","postDate":"1104117581","msgId":101769,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTUtREFWMTQ0RTg3RjczMkVGNUMyMDFFMzBCOEQ4OTkwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":101768,"nextInTopic":101770,"prevInTime":101768,"nextInTime":101770,"topicId":101764,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Since I am nowhere near a gourmet cook, we generally order a fully cooked ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-934680445\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;What do you all do?

Last year we used Gelson&#39;s in Los Angeles, which was a<br/>\nlittle pricey (4 adults), but this year we are in Galveston and got a cooked<br/>\nturkey dinner with sides, bread rolls and pies from Krogers (Ralphs chain)<br/>\nfor under $50.00. We were only three adults and Jayn eating and so we have<br/>\nhalf a turkey and a bunch of other leftovers for sandwiches and lunches in<br/>\nthe days following. <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW my dh did all the work of reheating the foods both this year and last,<br/>\nwhile Jayn and I set the table together. <br/>\n<br/>\nNext year my mother will be gone from this life. I have no idea whether my<br/>\nFIL will want to spend the season with us, or his brother and SIL and their<br/>\nfamily. Or he may choose to work over the holidays to free some young doctor<br/>\nwith kids from a shift in the ER, and escape sad memories. We may be living<br/>\nin our current home, or someplace else. We may be in the USA, or traveling.<br/>\nNext year will be the start of new traditions, in a sense free from the<br/>\nobligations to various family members on both sides that have felt<br/>\nincreasingly limiting to us, to tell the truth. It&#39;s all new from now on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe traveled to Galveston, TX on the gulf coast, expecting the usual balmy<br/>\nChristmas weather not unlike what we have experienced in Los Angeles. Every<br/>\n10 or 12 years this part of the world gets a sprinkling of snow. This year<br/>\nthere has been several inches of snow on Christmas Eve. This has been the<br/>\nmost on the ground on record. To our amazement we had a white Christmas, the<br/>\nfirst in my memory and my mother&#39;s last. <br/>\n<br/>\nI asked her if she could remember having a white Christmas at any time while<br/>\ntraveling in Europe when I was young - our childhoods in Australia feature<br/>\nsummer Christmases. Her answer revealed some confusion I think, since she<br/>\nwas talking about a school that she attended as a child, but I&#39;m thinking<br/>\nshe is possibly just transposing names, and it was while I was at some<br/>\nschool in Europe. I don&#39;t remember. I spent much of my childhood in Hong<br/>\nKong, another part of the world where snow is very rare.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I don&#39;t know if you all feel like me but I&#39;m exhausted!??  I just spent the past two days cooking, cleaning, taking care of the kids and doing it all over again as tons of folks came by for Xmas visits, food, and drinks!!  I&#39;m beginning to wonder if all this passing on the tradition of the Mom making a huge Xmas meal is really worth it? What are we teaching our kids - to run around like crazy and never relax for a moment?  Does anyone else feel like I do?   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids said, &quot;Wow, Xmas was great Mom but where were you?&quot;  Of course, I was in the kitchen the whole time.  I would have preferred to be sitting on the floor playing with the new toys my kids just got.  My dd and I were just laying in bed laughing and saying that next year we&#39;re going to serve our guests McDonalds happy meals so that MOM can chill out.  I&#39;m seriously thinking about it.  What do you all do?  Are you caught up in this kind of Xmas mania like me?<br/>\n<br/>\nElisa Tauraso - Mom to 4 n- dd7, dd6, ds4, and ds3.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101912,"nextTopicId":101700}}
