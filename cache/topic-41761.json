I think he was working <br/>\nthings out in his head, and when he got them worked out he verified <br/>\nhis observations with me, and that was that. Our talk that day was <br/>\none of the most interesting he and I have ever had. That happened <br/>\nagain when Jody (22) and I saw a video clip of the current favorite - <br/>\nsomething about Shady&#39;s back? - just before we drove out the Alaska <br/>\nHighway last July. One day as we were driving along the song came on <br/>\nthe radio, she mentioned the video, and we spent the next 200 miles <br/>\ntalking about the music industry, eminem&#39;s run-ins with the law, his <br/>\ncleverness in putting lyrics together, artists making comebacks, and <br/>\nshe told me about several musicians she&#39;s been enjoying listening to <br/>\nthat I&#39;d never heard of. One, Ani deFranco, is coming to Anchorage <br/>\nnext month and I&#39;m thinking of buying her a ticket to the performance <br/>\nif she doesn&#39;t have to work that day.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, whenever I hear an eminem song these days, I think about <br/>\nthose talks the kids and I might not otherwise have shared. Like most <br/>\nartists, he&#39;s just another source of food for thought, which is all I <br/>\nthink he ever really meant to be.
