They<br/>\nseemed to see themselves merely as the launchpad for me to be influenced<br/>\ndeeply by others. We ended up mostly estranged. But, in comparison to that,<br/>\nLuz and I are incredibly close to our son -- he still wants us to be the<br/>\nfirst to know his secrets. To me, that&#39;s a triumph and a treasure.**<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, Ned --<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the picture you paint of family closeness.  That&#39;s a major goal<br/>\nin my life as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nEstrangement and distance in the family may not even be the worst<br/>\neffects of schooling.  Having the parent be highly involved in the<br/>\nschooling process and be the enforcer that makes the child do homework<br/>\nmay be even worse than having the parent be uninvolved.  The idea that<br/>\noften a school parent may &quot;take sides&quot; and act in favor of the school<br/>\nand against their own child is just repulsive to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy bias is showing, but I find the stronger and stronger emphasis on<br/>\nhaving very young children do homework to be hideous.  A good friend of<br/>\nmine had her oldest in a full-day kindergarden that gave 5 homework<br/>\nassignments per week.  Her son even had homework assigned during Xmas<br/>\nvacation!  When I went to Kindergarden (nearly 40 years ago) I went to a<br/>\nhalf day program, and we even took a daily nap.  There was certainly no<br/>\nhomework.  Seems like they think kids today are made of sterner stuff. <br/>\n:::: grimace ::::<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40988,"nextTopicId":40990}}
