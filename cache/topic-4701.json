Men&#39;s happiness or misery is most part of their own making. He whose<br/>\nmind directs not wisely, will never take the right way; and he whose body is<br/>\ncrazy and feeble will never be able to advance in it. I confess there are<br/>\nsome men&#39;s constitutions of body and mind so vigorous and well framed by<br/>\nnature that they need not much assistance from others but by the strength of<br/>\ntheir natural genius they are from their cradles carried towards what is<br/>\nexcellent and by the privilege of their happy constitutions are able to do<br/>\nwonders. But examples of these are but few; and I think I may say that, of<br/>\nall the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil,<br/>\nuseful or not, by their education. &#39;Tis that which makes the great<br/>\ndifference in mankind. The little, and almost insensible impressions on our<br/>\ntender infancies, have very important and lasting consequences; and there<br/>\n&#39;tis, as in the fountains of some rivers where a gentle application of the<br/>\nhand turns the flexible waters into channels, that make them take quite<br/>\ncontrary courses, and by this little direction given them at first in the<br/>\nsource they receive different tendencies and arrive at last at very remote<br/>\nand distant places.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom:  &quot;Some Thoughts Concerning Education&quot; by John Locke, 1693<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Andersen<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/joandersen\">http://members.xoom.com/joandersen</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThese days a college degree is more a sign of conformity than intelligence.<br/>\nMaybe that&#39;s why it&#39;s in such high demand.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4696,"nextTopicId":4705}}
