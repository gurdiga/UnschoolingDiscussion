Didn&#39;t mean to offend. I do think, if a kid&#39;s <br/>\nready, he or she will read, no matter the age. One friend, when we <br/>\nfirst started homeschooling, had a boy whose first word was read when <br/>\nhe was two, and he hadn&#39;t slowed down as of age 11, when we knew <br/>\nthem. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut what I&#39;m talking about is teaching &quot;reading&quot; to little kids, who <br/>\nare capable of piecing together the sounds of words, without the <br/>\ncomprehension. English is really not that hard to learn. The schools <br/>\nmake it seem so, for their own reasons. With all of my kids, except <br/>\nmy late starter, a teensy weensy bit of phonics was all that was <br/>\nneeded, and then they were on to real reading. Not reading to show <br/>\noff, nor reading &quot;primer&quot; or &quot;reader&quot; type books, but real books. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My 3 yo is reading (and he has never had any phonics or any other <br/>\n&gt;lessons); <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So you didn&#39;t pick him up at age three and say &quot;Okay. Gonna learn to <br/>\nread.&quot; and then put him through phonics.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHAT&#39;S what I find ludicrous about those ads for phonics programs. <br/>\nExtensive phonics is not necessary for kids who are ready to read. <br/>\nExtensive phonics will make zero difference, for kids who are not <br/>\nready. I&#39;ve experienced both.<br/>\n<br/>\nand yes, I&#39;ve seen bad eyesight in kids who learned early, or who <br/>\nread a lot (myself included), while eyes remain stronger in kids <br/>\nwhose reading started a little bit later. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference in our current society is, while early reading is <br/>\nbeamed upon with great pride and respect, late reading is seen as <br/>\nsomething to be avoided and fretted over and worried about. To the <br/>\ndetriment of the late starting reader.<br/>\n<br/>\nthat&#39;s the point of my post. Not dissing early starting readers at <br/>\nall.<br/>\n<br/>\nsorry about the offense.

He might not &quot;get&quot; some of it, but he would absolutely comprehend a great deal (and would try to understand what he didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; by asking me a slew of questions).  Yesterday, he must have been reading my new book in the bathroom (The Well Dog Book), because he came out and called the dog and showed me her ear is called a &quot;pinna,&quot; and her heel is her &quot;hock,&quot; and her forehead is her &quot;stop.&quot;  His comprehension must be better than mine, because I am almost done w that book, had already read that section, and I didn&#39;t catch these terms.  Are you saying I should try to prevent my son from reading b/c it might strain his eyes?  Why would reading strain his eyes?
