I do pick up different<br/>\nworkbooks here and there because they look like something that may at<br/>\nsometime be interesting to my children, but they are always free to say<br/>\n&quot;no&quot;. I keep the workbooks in the same area as I do coloring books, arts<br/>\nand crafts scraps, play dough, you name it.

Maybe motivation<br/>\nis the wrong term. She has a very hard time making decisions. Everything<br/>\nfrom selecting what color vitamin to take, to what clothes to wear, to<br/>\nwhat she should be doing with her time. After much reflection on the<br/>\nposts yesterday, I think the apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree. I<br/>\nmyself have a hard time making decisions. I analyze, weigh, seek<br/>\napproval, and take many precautions before making a move. For this<br/>\nreason, I don&#39;t tend to get a lot done in a timely manner, but when<br/>\nthings are done, they are usually correct. I was never forced to make my<br/>\nown decisions. There was always someone, whether it be parents, teachers,<br/>\nfriends, ready to make decisions for me. I guess if I want my children to<br/>\nknow it is ok to make their own decisions, without having to concern<br/>\nthemselves with acceptance, the possibility of making mistakes, and such,<br/>\nI better improve at it myself. I guess whatever mistakes I make with my<br/>\nchildren can&#39;t possibly screw them up nearly as much as the stifling of<br/>\nthe spirit perpetuated by schools.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The goals<br/>\n&gt; are different than standard schooling: to help our kids be who they <br/>\n&gt; are and<br/>\n&gt; trust that they will learn what they need.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This trust thing is a problem.

I<br/>\ndon&#39;t concern myself with their educational capabilities ie: reading,<br/>\nwriting, arithmetic. I am sure that will all come in time when they are<br/>\nready. I am more concerned about there emotional well-being, and want<br/>\nthem to thrive and be able to find there own happiness in life, without<br/>\nthem feeling like I deprived them of something in childhood.
