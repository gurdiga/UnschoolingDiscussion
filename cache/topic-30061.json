There is a<br/>\nreference in, I think, the compulsory attendance law, to private school or<br/>\nbeing &quot;otherwise educated&quot;.

Then in a different part of his ruling -- if I&#39;m recalling<br/>\nthe order of the statements correctly -- says if the superintendent/school<br/>\ncommittee disapproves of the plan, the family can continue to homeschool<br/>\nwhile the super/SC works on proving that the plan is inadequate. It never<br/>\nsays that submitting a plan is all that&#39;s needed to begin homeschooling, but<br/>\nit certainly implies that.<br/>\n<br/>\non 12/18/01 11:19 AM, kayb85 at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheran@...\">sheran@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I thought their stance was that they didn&#39;t have to submit an<br/>\n&gt; education plan because it wasn&#39;t required by law, and that the school<br/>\n&gt; district was requiring what was above and beyond the law.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is no legistlatively passed law and one of the unambiguous statements<br/>\nin the case law is a requirement to submit an education plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one really wants to overturn Charles because, when interpretted<br/>\n&quot;properly&quot; ;-) and the state homeschooling group is working on a set of<br/>\nguidelines for superintendents, it&#39;s pretty homeschooling (and<br/>\n*unschooling*!) friendly.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1694471,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","profile":"anoydami","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: [HEM-Networking] Fw:  HomeschoolingFamily Loses Custody","postDate":"1008691982","msgId":30061,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTQwMWMxODdlMiRmODc0MTNjMCQ4YzVkZDFkMUBqaWRhMzU+","referencesHeader":"PEI4NDQ5REVGLjMzNEQlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30065,"prevInTime":30060,"nextInTime":30062,"topicId":30061,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is there actually a state law that requires the submission of the plan or not?  some of the articles being published say there isn t.

(It makes me realize<br/>\nwhy<br/>\n&gt; people get fed up with unschooling nitpicking ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It seemed shockingly uncaring to me that MA homeschoolers weren&#39;t<br/>\nsupporting<br/>\n&gt; the Bryants but apparently their case is based around their contention<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; the compulsory attendance law goes against state constitutionally<br/>\nguaranteed<br/>\n&gt; parental rights so the law itself is unconstitutional. There&#39;s a hugely<br/>\n&gt; steep learning curve involved in figuring out what in the world anyone is<br/>\n&gt; talking about in order to try to decide if such a law can be (legally)<br/>\n&gt; unconstitutional and if so whether it is and whether that really has<br/>\n&gt; anything to do with the legalities of homeschooling in MA. Basically the<br/>\n&gt; rallying cry is too muddled to get everyone to answer the call.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (The Bryants stance is they don&#39;t have to submit an education plan to be<br/>\n&gt; approved by the Superintendent since the compulsory attendance law is<br/>\n&gt; unconstitutional. One of the problems that prevents people from rallying<br/>\n&gt; around the case is that the education plan is not a much of a hoop to jump<br/>\n&gt; through (I use Carol Narigon&#39;s which I can pass on if anyone&#39;s interested)<br/>\n&gt; and the case law is very clear that the state can&#39;t dictate the manner of<br/>\n&gt; education so unschooling is very easy in MA.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s been a good summary of the two Mass homeschooling points of view<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; the case and why the Bryants aren&#39;t being backed universally by<br/>\n&gt; homeschoolers in MA on the MHLA email list. (The second list has had many<br/>\n&gt; ongoing discussions about it and others.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; masshomelearningassoc at Yahoo Groups (supposedly the MHLA list for<br/>\n&gt; nonpolitical homeschooling discussions but a good summary)<br/>\n&gt; MAhomeschoolers at Yahoo Groups (the MHLA list for political talk)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Whether the Bryants have helped the homeschooling atmosphere in Mass as<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; claim, or hindered as MHLA claims, apparently no real changes can happen<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; the foundation of the changes keeps coming back to the argument of whether<br/>\n&gt; to work with what is there (compulsory attendance laws and others) or<br/>\n&gt; whether that&#39;s ridiculous because the laws are unconstitutional. :-/<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The scary/sad part is the DSS involvement in what is by-the-legal-book<br/>\n&gt; educational neglect and therefore child neglect, but which doesn&#39;t match<br/>\n&gt; reality since the kids are clearly being well educated. (They probably<br/>\nknow<br/>\n&gt; a lot more about law than a lot of lawyers!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joyce<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; on 12/17/01 7:32 PM, Helen Hegener at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM-Editor@...\">HEM-Editor@...</a><br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for posting that link, Lynda.
