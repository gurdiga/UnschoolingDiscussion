Either have your supposed sources stand up<br/>\nand be counted or stuff your bs!  You are good at English, or so you say, so<br/>\nyou should know the definition of libel.  Also, just in case you didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow, being the promulgator of innuendos and gossip is actionable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually ignore you when you stoop yet once again to sophomoric behavior.<br/>\nLots of folks think you are a bag of hot air, posturing and strutting around<br/>\nplaying expert and that ignoring you would be the best way to deal with<br/>\nsomeone with National Enquirer journalistic proclivities.  Twould appear<br/>\nthat they were wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you are now attacking others, I will be more than happy to send them<br/>\nchapter and verse on where you are stepping over the legal line and how to<br/>\ndeal with you.  I hope we are real clear on this now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, you are aware that there is medication for delusional behavior and<br/>\nparanoia.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 12, 2001 10:13 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1454<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 9/12/01 11:03:42 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; That isn&#39;t an example of dishonesty.  that&#39;s an example of<br/>\n&gt; miscommunication.<br/>\n&gt; AND, she did come back and explain it and people are still harping.  In<br/>\n&gt; fact, she explained it in great depth.  I don&#39;t have to go back to look,<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; was about being the only one who could fix it once it was unhooked.  They<br/>\n&gt; know it, she knows it, the whole list knows it if they bothered to read<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt; was written, not what they decided was written.
