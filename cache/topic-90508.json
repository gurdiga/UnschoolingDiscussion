Hope its not a repeat.  I&#39;ve been reading the articles on <br/>\n  your site.  And I know that you started out as a teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When you had your children.  Did you start out as an unschooler?  Or did you <br/>\n  work your way toward that?  Do you have an article that explains how you went <br/>\n  from being a teacher to unschooling?<br/>\n  -----------<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s not all collected in one place.  Maybe I should do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As with all hindsight and connect-the-dots, sometimes I think of something <br/>\n  else that contributed to making it easier for me to unschool with complete <br/>\n  confidence.  Sometimes it&#39;s a small thing and sometimes a big one.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I wanted to be a teacher from the time I was six, but looking back I see that <br/>\n  what I really wanted was to be like teachers I knew and liked.  They had <br/>\n  read, they laughed, they talked about interesting things, they had travelled, they <br/>\n  were nice to kids.  (I saw exceptions, and those are the teachers I didn&#39;t <br/>\n  want to be like.  Since I had decided I was going to be one, I noticed all the <br/>\n  good things because that was what I wanted to emulate.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  When I went to college I studied English and psychology.  I was young.  <br/>\n  17-20.  I got interested in anthropology too, and folklore.   I took education <br/>\n  classes kind of on the side (we were required to have a major and minor and THEN <br/>\n  take the education classes in addition).  It was the early 70&#39;s and the <br/>\n  professors I had were mostly school-reform advocates, and they talked about all the <br/>\n  latest studies that showed how the schools themselves caused most of the <br/>\n  problems and how these things were being overcome in experimental schools.  They had <br/>\n  us read John Holt, who was not yet a homeschooling advocate, but was pretty <br/>\n  radical!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I taught where I had gone to school.  Some of the people I taught with had <br/>\n  been my teachers.  They liked me and had faith in me and let me be experimental. <br/>\n  Still, it was school.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Things were being difficult in my life outside of school, my mom had become a <br/>\n  fulltime drunk (at the bar from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m), my dad remarried <br/>\n  twice and then died, my mom had a little boy (my half brother) she wasn&#39;t taking <br/>\n  good care of and I had custody of him, I married a friend whose parents had <br/>\n  died and we had custody of his younger brother and sister, so when I was 21 I <br/>\n  had custody of a 10 and 12 year old and soon added a four year old brother.   A <br/>\n  lot; all had side issues, we did the best we could, and learned a lot and <br/>\n  things were rough.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Time passed, and not smoothly.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I moved to Albuquerque to go to grad school and be with Keith, who had lived <br/>\n  with me and my first husband for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When I was 31 I was in a whole &#39;nother situation.  Second round of custody of <br/>\n  my brother who was a young teen then (not doing well, fetal alcohol syndrome <br/>\n  featuring lack of conscience, plus poor guy had been with my mom most of that <br/>\n  ensuing time, and I saw more of what not to do; heended up in a juvenile <br/>\n  detention situation,and then I arranged for my mom to regain custody for a while, <br/>\n  learning too much law in the process) .<br/>\n  I had quit teaching when I moved to Albuquerque and for a while I worked in <br/>\n  the records office at the university, and then I worked fulltime as the CEO <br/>\n  (working from my home and travelling to board meetings) of the Society for <br/>\n  Creative Anachronism for a couple of years.  So I learned a lot about non-profits <br/>\n  and bulk mailings and printing and management and organization and management, <br/>\n  but also lots about the philosophy of how people can learn in the course of <br/>\n  &quot;just&quot; trying to put on medieval feasts and tournaments. Some people there said <br/>\n  we should, as a non-profit educational organization, be doing community <br/>\n  outreach and teaching the general public about the Middle Ages.  I argued that our <br/>\n  existence gave them the opportunity to come and learn if they wanted to, and we <br/>\n  weren&#39;t chartered as missionaries, but as studying in order to put on feasts <br/>\n  and tournaments by and for our own membership.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Those discussions clarified a lot for me about natural learning.  Being <br/>\n  around people in that organization who were going from zero to professional outside <br/>\n  of school, without certificates, learning it all for fun and many ending up <br/>\n  with real expertise, producing amazing things, put me past ANY doubt that <br/>\n  learning can be just about effortless when it&#39;s fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Keith and I got married in 1984 (20th anniversary coming, but we were <br/>\n  together six years before we married).<br/>\n<br/>\n     I was going to Adult Children of Alcoholics meetings, had Kirby, went to <br/>\n  La Leche League, and the messages of those two organizations melded to change <br/>\n  me.  I didn&#39;t need to be my mom; further, I needed in many ways profoundly NOT <br/>\n  to be my mom.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We figured Kirby would go to school when the time came.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our family was one of several families in a playgroup and babysitting co-op <br/>\n  made up mostly of La Leche League leaders and hardcore members, invitation <br/>\n  only, strictly attachment parenting.   Of the dozen to 18 families, four were <br/>\n  homeschoolers. Two structured, two unschooling.  I knew their homes, the dads, the <br/>\n  kids.  Kids had been at my house without parents.  My kids had been to their <br/>\n  houses.   That&#39;s about as close as it gets to intimate knowledge of how the <br/>\n  kids are with and without their parents around.<br/>\n<br/>\n  By the time Kirby was four, we knew school wasn&#39;t going to be a good match <br/>\n  for him. He was zippy yet sensitive.  He was brave, and yet clingy.   He&#39;d go <br/>\n  quiet and thoughtful, and then way talkative.  We decided to keep him home the <br/>\n  kindergarten year with the option the next year of public kindergarten, public <br/>\n  first grade, or continued homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;d seen firsthand the problems in the school-at-home families and also seen <br/>\n  the calm and the happiness in the unschooling families, so I went that way.  <br/>\n  All the experiences in my life to that point made me confident.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I still figured Marty might want to go to school, but when the time came he <br/>\n  didn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That&#39;s about it!  I went directly to unschooling, but in a way it was like <br/>\n  being still and letting the waters rise around me, rather than jumping off a <br/>\n  cliff from school into an unknown.  I worked up to it over the years, without <br/>\n  knowing what I was working up to.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Much of life is like that, isn&#39;t it?  That&#39;s why unschooling works as well as <br/>\n  it does.  If our kids live their rich lives, it works up to something, but we <br/>\n  don&#39;t know what until it happens.

It was simply something that I learned by <br/>\nwatching others and asking questions.  I have always loved math and <br/>\nnumbers so the CFO position was a no brainer as far as I was <br/>\nconcerned.  However, as most of you know, I couldn&#39;t just walk in <br/>\nand get a CFO position with no degree or formal education.  So, I <br/>\nstarted at the bottom and worked my way up, both times.  Once the <br/>\nbosses saw that I really did know what I was talking about and <br/>\ndoing, that was all it took.  Of course, to cover their own butts, <br/>\nan &quot;real&quot; accountant came in and checked my work once a month.  He <br/>\nalways told the boss that she was wasting her money having him come <br/>\nin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real estate agent thing was sort of an accident.  I needed a <br/>\npart time job to help with money and met someone (an agent) who was <br/>\nlooking for an office assistant.  After working with him a week, he <br/>\nhad me talking to the clients and helping to arrange financing for <br/>\nthem (another numbers job for me).  I loved working with him and, <br/>\nbefore I knew it (or him, for that matter), I was taking offers and <br/>\nmaking counter offers on our listings.  The title companies that I <br/>\nworked with just assumed that I was an agent from out of the area.  <br/>\nI loved that job but ended up leaving because it was taking WAY too <br/>\nmuch time away from my DD and DH.  I still have friends who call and <br/>\nask me to look over contracts before they make an offer on homes. <br/>\nThese are people who have their own agents!  They know that I really <br/>\ndo have their best interests at heart.  As a matter of fact, I just <br/>\nsuggested to a friend of mine the other day not to make an offer on <br/>\na house she had her heart set on.....there was just too much work to <br/>\nbe done and I knew she&#39;d never have the time to do it.  Once I <br/>\npointed the different things out to her, she said that I was right <br/>\nand, no big surprise here, her agent didn&#39;t point any of these <br/>\nthings our to her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I went directly to unschooling, but in a way it was like <br/>\nbeing still and letting the waters rise around me, rather than <br/>\njumping off a cliff from school into an unknown.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it might be a little easier for someone who starts out not <br/>\nputting their kids in school at all.

I <br/>\nstarted to read about homeschooling and, as soon as I read about <br/>\nunschooling, something in my brain yelled &quot;Yes, that&#39;s it!&quot;  I never <br/>\nlooked any further.  Then I went to Yahoo Groups and found this <br/>\ngroup.  I knew that I wanted to unschool as far as education but, <br/>\nyou all have helped me to unschool in all other aspects of life.

Did you start out as an unschooler?  Or did you <br/>\nwork your way toward that?  Do you have an article that explains how you went <br/>\nfrom being a teacher to unschooling?<br/>\n-----------<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not all collected in one place.  Maybe I should do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs with all hindsight and connect-the-dots, sometimes I think of something <br/>\nelse that contributed to making it easier for me to unschool with complete <br/>\nconfidence.  Sometimes it&#39;s a small thing and sometimes a big one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to be a teacher from the time I was six, but looking back I see that <br/>\nwhat I really wanted was to be like teachers I knew and liked.  They had <br/>\nread, they laughed, they talked about interesting things, they had travelled, they <br/>\nwere nice to kids.  (I saw exceptions, and those are the teachers I didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to be like.  Since I had decided I was going to be one, I noticed all the <br/>\ngood things because that was what I wanted to emulate.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I went to college I studied English and psychology.  I was young.  <br/>\n17-20.  I got interested in anthropology too, and folklore.   I took education <br/>\nclasses kind of on the side (we were required to have a major and minor and THEN <br/>\ntake the education classes in addition).  It was the early 70&#39;s and the <br/>\nprofessors I had were mostly school-reform advocates, and they talked about all the <br/>\nlatest studies that showed how the schools themselves caused most of the <br/>\nproblems and how these things were being overcome in experimental schools.  They had <br/>\nus read John Holt, who was not yet a homeschooling advocate, but was pretty <br/>\nradical!<br/>\n<br/>\nI taught where I had gone to school.  Some of the people I taught with had <br/>\nbeen my teachers.  They liked me and had faith in me and let me be experimental. <br/>\n Still, it was school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThings were being difficult in my life outside of school, my mom had become a <br/>\nfulltime drunk (at the bar from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m), my dad remarried <br/>\ntwice and then died, my mom had a little boy (my half brother) she wasn&#39;t taking <br/>\ngood care of and I had custody of him, I married a friend whose parents had <br/>\ndied and we had custody of his younger brother and sister, so when I was 21 I <br/>\nhad custody of a 10 and 12 year old and soon added a four year old brother.   A <br/>\nlot; all had side issues, we did the best we could, and learned a lot and <br/>\nthings were rough.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime passed, and not smoothly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI moved to Albuquerque to go to grad school and be with Keith, who had lived <br/>\nwith me and my first husband for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 31 I was in a whole &#39;nother situation.  Second round of custody of <br/>\nmy brother who was a young teen then (not doing well, fetal alcohol syndrome <br/>\nfeaturing lack of conscience, plus poor guy had been with my mom most of that <br/>\nensuing time, and I saw more of what not to do; heended up in a juvenile <br/>\ndetention situation,and then I arranged for my mom to regain custody for a while, <br/>\nlearning too much law in the process) .<br/>\nI had quit teaching when I moved to Albuquerque and for a while I worked in <br/>\nthe records office at the university, and then I worked fulltime as the CEO <br/>\n(working from my home and travelling to board meetings) of the Society for <br/>\nCreative Anachronism for a couple of years.  So I learned a lot about non-profits <br/>\nand bulk mailings and printing and management and organization and management, <br/>\nbut also lots about the philosophy of how people can learn in the course of <br/>\n&quot;just&quot; trying to put on medieval feasts and tournaments. Some people there said <br/>\nwe should, as a non-profit educational organization, be doing community <br/>\noutreach and teaching the general public about the Middle Ages.  I argued that our <br/>\nexistence gave them the opportunity to come and learn if they wanted to, and we <br/>\nweren&#39;t chartered as missionaries, but as studying in order to put on feasts <br/>\nand tournaments by and for our own membership.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose discussions clarified a lot for me about natural learning.  Being <br/>\naround people in that organization who were going from zero to professional outside <br/>\nof school, without certificates, learning it all for fun and many ending up <br/>\nwith real expertise, producing amazing things, put me past ANY doubt that <br/>\nlearning can be just about effortless when it&#39;s fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith and I got married in 1984 (20th anniversary coming, but we were <br/>\ntogether six years before we married).<br/>\n<br/>\n   I was going to Adult Children of Alcoholics meetings, had Kirby, went to <br/>\nLa Leche League, and the messages of those two organizations melded to change <br/>\nme.  I didn&#39;t need to be my mom; further, I needed in many ways profoundly NOT <br/>\nto be my mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe figured Kirby would go to school when the time came.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur family was one of several families in a playgroup and babysitting co-op <br/>\nmade up mostly of La Leche League leaders and hardcore members, invitation <br/>\nonly, strictly attachment parenting.   Of the dozen to 18 families, four were <br/>\nhomeschoolers. Two structured, two unschooling.  I knew their homes, the dads, the <br/>\nkids.  Kids had been at my house without parents.  My kids had been to their <br/>\nhouses.   That&#39;s about as close as it gets to intimate knowledge of how the <br/>\nkids are with and without their parents around.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time Kirby was four, we knew school wasn&#39;t going to be a good match <br/>\nfor him. He was zippy yet sensitive.  He was brave, and yet clingy.   He&#39;d go <br/>\nquiet and thoughtful, and then way talkative.  We decided to keep him home the <br/>\nkindergarten year with the option the next year of public kindergarten, public <br/>\nfirst grade, or continued homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d seen firsthand the problems in the school-at-home families and also seen <br/>\nthe calm and the happiness in the unschooling families, so I went that way.  <br/>\nAll the experiences in my life to that point made me confident.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still figured Marty might want to go to school, but when the time came he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s about it!  I went directly to unschooling, but in a way it was like <br/>\nbeing still and letting the waters rise around me, rather than jumping off a <br/>\ncliff from school into an unknown.  I worked up to it over the years, without <br/>\nknowing what I was working up to.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch of life is like that, isn&#39;t it?  That&#39;s why unschooling works as well as <br/>\nit does.  If our kids live their rich lives, it works up to something, but we <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what until it happens.  And if we attach to a moment or a goal, <br/>\nwe&#39;ll feel like failures when that passes on by.  If my only success would have <br/>\nbeen taking care of my mom or my brother, or my first marriage, or teaching, I <br/>\nwould be a many-times failure.  But if my success was to keep on learning and <br/>\nbeing a good and happy Sandra, then I was successful throughout and still am. <br/>\n I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll be doing in five years, but if I keep focussed on <br/>\nnow, it should be something based naturally on what has gone before.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90549,"nextTopicId":82079}}
