I just got <br/>\noff the phone with my husband and said &quot;this is all about me and how I deal <br/>\nwith this issue&quot;... It&#39;s not about the kids because they seem great.  As I&#39;m <br/>\nreplying to this e-mail Zak ( nearly 6) is making puzzle words and Max <br/>\n(nearly 2) is helping him (well walking away with the pieces and showing me <br/>\nand then coming back to Zak).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo working on the guilt I feel for wanting to work and keeping my kids home <br/>\nis where I&#39;m at... I bet you didn&#39;t think it was that deeply psychological <br/>\ndid you Tracy (LOL)?<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nDawn Falbe  <br/>\nPersonal Development Coach<br/>\nRelocational Astrologer<br/>\n(520) 579-2646<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nThe Path of Least Resistance is Inside of You<br/>\nwww.astrologerdawn.com<br/>\nEnlightening women on how to live their Soul Purpose<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The people who get on in this world<br/>\n are people who get up and look for the<br/>\n circumstances they want, and, <br/>\nif they can&#39;t find them, make them.&quot; - George Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"gNZnzYQm2txrJH1KiXMYlVzXvdvcHgLmHrEz4gJCfh4pd0Hn5D0kmuvMDuYYeojBvjygT8UIKOAY0C0AC1ZP3T-4N4MLhLVwOzZVNoqV9HolT3g6EA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Home Business and Unschooling","postDate":"995057083","msgId":22856,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNCNEY2QkNCLjI1MzMuNDQ3RkFEQGxvY2FsaG9zdD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDlpbm0yOCtrMzBmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22855,"nextInTopic":22858,"prevInTime":22855,"nextInTime":22857,"topicId":22855,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So here s the dilemna then...
