Not micromanaging his time has been a huge shift for me, and<br/>\nthere is no one in my life who is doing this, so I appreciate any feedback I<br/>\ncan get to help me get through this change.  I particularly appreciate<br/>\nsuggestions about how I can be involved even if I&#39;m not right there:<br/>\nbringing snacks, moving his console upstairs, talking with him about it,<br/>\nfinding him magazines, etc.etc.etc. - I really get a feel for how this<br/>\nlooks/feels and can focus my efforts constructively to do these things.<br/>\nYour feedback also really met my need for reassurance that how he is<br/>\nchoosing to spend his time is most certainly in line with my beliefs of not<br/>\nwanting to make decisions for him.  As I mentioned, it is just such a<br/>\nradical shift, some perspective from you is very helpful.  I also<br/>\nappreciated, Sandra, your comment that VG research has often been measured<br/>\nby school success (you didn&#39;t say that specifically, but that is what I<br/>\nunderstood - is that a correct statement?) - this helps tremendously as I<br/>\nshelve all the books I&#39;ve read regarding this issue - I feel that I can shut<br/>\nthe door without looking back if that&#39;s true.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyways, this is a very active list - it&#39;s hard to keep up with the<br/>\nvolume!  Thank-you again,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Michele</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94595,"nextTopicId":94557}}
