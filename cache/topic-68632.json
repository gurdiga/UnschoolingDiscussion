(The monkey hoot from the back row of someone with <br/>\nsomething to SAY!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis weekend when I was out and about, one discussion was just me and the <br/>\ndad, after we had dropped Kirby off with the prom gang (where the boys had <br/>\njust shown up too, and so all were in one place, in a mountain parking lot <br/>\nbetween towns, in their formals, heels, etc. &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was about Mother&#39;s Day.<br/>\nIt was about, on my end, how Mother&#39;s Day is at my house, and on his end, how <br/>\nit is all screwed up at his house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the hope of making sure it was a big deal, he reminded his stepsons two <br/>\nmonths ago.  He reminded them a month ago; nothing.  He remined them two <br/>\nweeks and a week ago; nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a lot of negativity to lay as a foundation for a day on which all the <br/>\nmom asked for was some time all alone, which she got!  But meanwhile backstag<br/>\ne the boys are set up to fail, and the step dad sees them as ungrateful <br/>\nslouches who don&#39;t appeciate their mother nor his thoughtful reminders.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere was my mother&#39;s day.<br/>\nKeith asked me Friday if there was anything I wanted to do.  I said no, maybe <br/>\nTwo Towers at the dollar flick.  (But Kirby and I got back too late for that <br/>\nanyway.)  We discussed that I&#39;d be with Kirby most of the day, and he&#39;s the <br/>\nkid who caused my motherhood to happen, so that seemed kind of appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I was with the other family, I was privileged to partake of a big <br/>\nbreakfast of sausage-grave, biscuits and eggs all made by male people (Kirby <br/>\nwas sleeping off the prom still).  I got &quot;Happy Mother&#39;s Day&quot; greetings from <br/>\nsome teens and the adults we were with. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we left there Kirby had already gone out for lunch with a couple of the <br/>\ngirls from the night before, and I asked him to stop at Sonic so I could get <br/>\nsomething before the two hour drive.  I ordered my stuff and held out money <br/>\nto him (he was driving) and he said &quot;No!  It&#39;s Mother&#39;s Day!&quot; and he paid for <br/>\nmy lunch at Sonic.  That was not too bad.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly met me in the yard with a big hug.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty had bought me two bags of dark chocolate Dove miniatures.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was it, but it was every bit sweet and sincere and nobody had reminded <br/>\nthem and I wasn&#39;t going to pout if they hadn&#39;t done anything at all!!  I was <br/>\nhappy to be with them and it was a good day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":144628419,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"&quot;Kelli Traaseth&quot; &lt;tktraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] RElaxed parenting--info","postDate":"1052751420","msgId":68682,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYTcwMWMzMTg5NiRiZTAzZDhiMCRhMjMzMTlhY0B5b3VyZ2c4N3Zxem96cT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDEwMWMzMTg1YiRjNDY0M2QyMCQzNDAwYThjMEByb2J5bm1hY2hpbmU+"},"prevInTopic":68647,"nextInTopic":68734,"prevInTime":68681,"nextInTime":68683,"topicId":68632,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t know if anyone has mentioned  Living Joyfully With Children  by Win and Bill Sweet,   its one of my favs!

The jacket is<br/>\nterrible too, I can only guess that both were created by someone in a<br/>\nmarketing department. The book itself is about how to get past the need to<br/>\ncontrol, why control doesn&#39;t work, how kids learn from our examples and the<br/>\nonly control we can truly exert is self-control, etc. I felt that it helped<br/>\nme along my parenting journey more than any other book. The other books like<br/>\n&quot;How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk&quot; have some<br/>\ngood &quot;tips and tricks&quot; (like lists of &quot;alternatives to &#39;No&#39;&quot;), but this book<br/>\nis more like the underlying foundation for respectful parenting, and how to<br/>\nachieve it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like this particular little list, I can&#39;t remember where I saved it<br/>\nfrom:<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a &quot;declaration of complete confidence in children&quot;:<br/>\n<br/>\n  1..

Children respond best to modeling and leadership, not control.<br/>\n<br/>\n  4.. Trust... and wait.<br/>\n<br/>\n  5.. Choose between your momentary convenience and your long-term goal for<br/>\nyour child&#39;s sense of self.<br/>\n<br/>\n  6.. Enjoy your child for who he is, not for who you would like him to be -<br/>\nhe will never be this age again.<br/>\n<br/>\n  7..

Right now, I am struggling with my ds who turned 2 <br/>\nyesterday.  I started flipping through a positve discipline book I <br/>\nhad bought years ago and never read.  I was ready to run it over with <br/>\nmy car!!  The examples were so proposterous that I was insulted along <br/>\nwith making claims such as you could spoil a new baby in some rare <br/>\ncases.  Needless to say, we are not pursuing this book.  However, I <br/>\nwould love some feedback on great books or sites that discuss a <br/>\nrelaxed parenting approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank You.
