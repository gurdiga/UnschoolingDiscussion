He was passionate about it almost <br/>\nimmediately, and never went through any struggle.  In fact, one of the main <br/>\nreasons we decided we had to pull him out is that he told us the problem with <br/>\nschool was that there was never enough time to read. School more interfered <br/>\nthan helped him with reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think kids pick these things up when they&#39;re ready, however we school, <br/>\nunschool, or try to influence them. You MIGHT in school or homeschool be able <br/>\nto push a kid who&#39;s not ready to read, but will probably mess up any chance <br/>\nof the child&#39;s LIKING it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was a very early reader (early 4) and my mom says she never &quot;taught&quot; me...I <br/>\njust started reading, because I loved it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":80992264,"authorName":"Diane","from":"Diane &lt;cen46624@...&gt;","profile":"dwesner123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Unschooling/late readers, was OKhere is my  question :0) How do they learn??","postDate":"1007839795","msgId":29676,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDMTI2QTMzLjgyNjFCRjQxQGN5YmVydHJhaWxzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEM3QkM0NDBCLUVCOUItMTFENS04QTgxLTAwMDM5MzQ5RDRBRUBob3VzdG9uLnJyLmNvbT4gPDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAxMTIwODA5MTE1MS4wMDlmZmVjMEBtYWlsLmlzbGFuZG5ldC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":29747,"prevInTime":29675,"nextInTime":29677,"topicId":29676,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Also it may be that those with early readers don t have the same need for support or the ability to provide it with personal stories.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1458784202\">Also it may be that those with early readers don&#39;t have the same need for support or the ability<br/>\nto provide it with personal stories.<br/>\n<br/>\n:-) Diane<br/>\n<br/>\nTia Leschke wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So, I keep seeing these statements that unschoolers read later and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wondering why.  I mean, I understand and it is to be expected that some<br/>\n&gt; &gt;children will learn later than other children as they are all individuals<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and not some little wind up toys that are pre-programed to learn things at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;certain ages.  However, it seems that the stats are somewhat titled.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My guess is that a lot of those &quot;late&quot; readers would be pushed, either in<br/>\n&gt; school or doing school-at-home, and that a lot of them would more or less<br/>\n&gt; get reading at an earlier age than if they were the ones deciding when to<br/>\n&gt; read.  Of course a lot of those will likely become readers who choose not<br/>\n&gt; to read unless made to.<br/>\n&gt; Tia<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tia Leschke   leschke@...<br/>\n&gt; On Vancouver Island<br/>\n&gt; ********************************************************************************************<br/>\n&gt; It is the answers which separate us, the questions which unite us. - Janice<br/>\n&gt; Levy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   ----------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\n&gt; Checked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\n&gt; Version: 6.0.303 / Virus Database: 164 - Release Date: 24/11/01<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: http://www.unschooling.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; http://www.home-ed-magazine.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
