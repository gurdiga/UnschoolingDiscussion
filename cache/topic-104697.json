Who<br/>\nare we?<br/>\n <br/>\nLive Free Learn Free is a magazine for unschoolers and relaxed<br/>\nhomeschoolers in which to share ideas, stories, and experiences. All<br/>\nmaterial is written by those who home educate Â– both parents and<br/>\nchildren. It is an inclusive magazine, not only for and by experienced<br/>\nunschoolers, but also for and by those just starting down the path. It<br/>\nembraces those who are radical in their unschooling methods and those<br/>\nwho are less so.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut mostly, it&#39;s a magazine about children living life - really<br/>\nliving<br/>\nlife - unhindered by curriculums, by lunch bells and standardized<br/>\ntests, by schoolyard bullies and tedious homework.  It&#39;s about<br/>\nfreedom.  It&#39;s about families growing closer than they ever dreamed<br/>\npossible.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re looking for contributions on later readers, real work for kids,<br/>\nand camp experiences, as well as on various other unschooling<br/>\nsubjects.  You can view our submissions page for details of the themes<br/>\nand submission guidelines (several guidelines have been changed<br/>\nrecently): <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livefreelearnfree.com/submit.htm\">http://www.livefreelearnfree.com/submit.htm</a><br/>\n <br/>\nIf you&#39;d like to know more or you have any questions, feel free to<br/>\nemail me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:folkypoet@...\">folkypoet@...</a>.<br/>\n <br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nShana Ronayne Hickman (editor)<br/>\nwww.livefreelearnfree.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104661,"nextTopicId":104713}}
