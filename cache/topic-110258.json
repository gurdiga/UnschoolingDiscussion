When I went to put it somewhere for others <br/>\nto find later, I found this:<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\n I saved this without keeping the name, date or place and it&#39;s been a while <br/>\nso I honestly don&#39;t remember who wrote it at all. And I bet the author has <br/>\nchanged her thoughts, so it&#39;s a relic and can stand without credit. It was from <br/>\nsome unschooling discussion in 2004, and more recent comments will follow.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- The reason this conversation is really bothering me, is because Sandra <br/>\nkept responding with other points that had nothing to do with my one and only <br/>\nquestion. (Her points are GREAT ones, and ones I in fact agree with, but they <br/>\nare points about something other that my one question: Should I give my 4 & 7 <br/>\nyear olds that particular game? She never said Yes (and why) or NO (and why). <br/>\nYou might ask yourself if you were trying to have a conversation with someone <br/>\nand they were skipping over your particular question, and making lots of other <br/>\npoints that had nothing to do with what you were still trying to talk about!!! <br/>\nI&#39;m not wound up and defensive and angry. Although I find myself frustrated, <br/>\nand now on the defense trying to tell you (and Sandra) that I agree with all <br/>\nthose points she made, BUT IT&#39;S NOT WHAT I&#39;M TALKING ABOUT. That&#39;s all.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n A question like &quot;should I buy this, yes or no?&quot; isn&#39;t the kind of questions <br/>\nothers can answer very well. And if we did, we&#39;d need to say WHY we thought <br/>\nno, which would involve explaining a principle. And with all of the best <br/>\nanswers, it needs to start, &quot;It depends.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n If we answer questions with &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no,&quot; and give people what they claim <br/>\nto want, or what they think they want, we are chucking fish out instead of <br/>\nproviding information on how to fish, how to make one&#39;s own custom fishing <br/>\nequipment and when and where the fishing is great. Unschooling can&#39;t work as a <br/>\nseries of yes/no questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n Another principle at work. Helping people learn to find their own answers is <br/>\nvastly superior to distributing answers on demand. And those who volunteer <br/>\ntheir time and experience are not willing to hold other&#39;s hands for years or <br/>\nmonths. They want to empower others. Empowerment is a principle, not a rule. <br/>\nLearning to examine one&#39;s own life and needs and beliefs is necessary for <br/>\nunschooling to work. When priorities and principles are coming clearer, such questions <br/>\nas whether or not to buy a particular game or tool or movie or food are EASY, <br/>\nsimple, happy questions. That&#39;s why the mom quoted above didn&#39;t get the <br/>\nsimple straight answer she thought she needed. No one wanted to waste time or <br/>\nenergy sending her down the wrong path.<br/>\n-------------------------------------------<br/>\n(end of that quote)<br/>\n-----------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people think they just need to know something simple, a rule, when <br/>\nthey really could use having a principle so they wouldn&#39;t NEED the simple <br/>\nanswers or more rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat above and Mary Ellen&#39;s math quote and comments are both here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/rulebound\">http://sandradodd.com/rulebound</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"rules and principles and math","postDate":"1133151521","msgId":110258,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYjEwMWM1ZjNkMiRkMjNjNWMyMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBob21lPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRtYXZhNCtpcmN0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MUI1QUQ3NzQtRDQ2Qi00MDFBLUEyQ0YtN0VENUJCMEREMkE3QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":110263,"prevInTime":110257,"nextInTime":110259,"topicId":110258,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I thought a quote from a book I m reading was interesting.

I could manipulate numbers and symbols accurately because I knew the rules.  Gord, however, understood the principles.  He explained exponents in a way that made me understand that I had been looking at a map of mathematics and Gord knew the countryside of it.  That is an inadequate explanation for such a subtle awakening, but it is the best I can do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110262,"nextTopicId":110272}}
