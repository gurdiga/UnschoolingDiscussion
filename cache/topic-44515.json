I leave articles out for him and <br/>\nhe reads them.  He does not always finish them though.  He told me <br/>\nthe other day, &quot;maybe I don&#39;t want to understand what you are <br/>\ndoing&quot;...???...&quot;it is too different.&quot;  Geez, what can I do?  He will <br/>\nneed to see proof and while I see a lot of it and point it out he is <br/>\ncaught up on comparing our son....big mistake I know.  I tell him <br/>\nconstantly how comparing will never work especially with a child <br/>\nwith LD&#39;s.  Even if ds &quot;caught up&quot; with all the rest, he&#39;d probably <br/>\nstill be dissapointed.  Deep seated issues...we talked about him <br/>\ndealing with those.  Dh does know that homeschooling is right, but <br/>\nunschooling is a different ballgame.  On another note, my ds has <br/>\nbeen very emotional the past few days.  He is pulling away from any <br/>\nreading (me reading to him!), etc.  He is having quite a few <br/>\noutbursts lately that have suprised me, but maybe he is adjusting?  <br/>\nHas anyone experienced this?  My dh says I have given too much <br/>\nfreedom too quickly that I should have eased off.  I imagine we&#39;ll <br/>\npass through this.  Meanwhile, I have to figure out how to tell the <br/>\nprincipal that I do not want any services for him at all....she is <br/>\ngoing to give me @#$% for that.  Pull up my boot straps I guess.  <br/>\nThanks for all the help,<br/>\nMichelle <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@y...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Michelle,  Does it help to show him examples of things you&#39;ve done <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that havn&#39;t worked?

It is <br/>\nmuch needed as my husband&#39;s stress is increasing and it does trickle <br/>\ndown.  He spent a day home with us (during the week)yesterday and <br/>\nasked if &quot;this&quot; is what the kids do all day?  Even though I was not <br/>\nfeeling well with a nasty cold the kids shared with me we still made <br/>\nsome apple bread together (discussed fractions and subtracting) and <br/>\nread together.  We read from our true/false interesting fact <br/>\ncards...the kids think they are funny.  My son played Caesar II <br/>\n(Build a better Rome) which he is obsessed with as is my husband.  <br/>\nThey played outside and watered their pumpkin seeds they had <br/>\nplanted.  We talked about greenhouses and the reasons why they might <br/>\nnot grow here in Okinawa.  I thought it was a good day considering I <br/>\nslept off an on and fought off congestion and a fever. Even though I <br/>\nwould like to be deschooling more comfortably. Nevertheless, my <br/>\nhusband has been supportive, but it is wearing off.  I have given <br/>\nhim several articles and I will give him yours....he is just making <br/>\ncomments like &quot;she needs to be learning her letter sounds (5 yr.old <br/>\nd)despite the fact that he listened to me dictate 3 sentences she <br/>\nasked for and she wrote all the letters on her own...she couldn&#39;t do <br/>\nthat a week ago!  &quot;He needs to be doing his math ...he can&#39;t even <br/>\nadd 5 + 2! (son with LDs)...my husband says he can&#39;t handle it much <br/>\nlonger...I keep telling him he has got to look outside of the box.  <br/>\nHe is now trying to force my son to read i.e. with his Caesar game <br/>\nhe is struggling with stages and my husband tells him to read the <br/>\npop up boxes ...my son just says &quot;I did&quot; and doesn&#39;t ask for help <br/>\nanymore (he did not read them).  He sat down with him last night to <br/>\nread and made him read to him(dad)and it was labored and it upsets <br/>\nme.  He is becoming more reluctant to read or do anything remotely <br/>\nlike schoolwork and I don&#39;t blame him...I expected it.  I am sorry <br/>\nfor such a long post, it just comes at a moment when my dh left to <br/>\nrun errands and I can tell he is about to blow in regards to the <br/>\nchildrens&#39; education.  I don&#39;t know what else to do to help him <br/>\nunderstand.  I&#39;ll invite him to ask questions of the group, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know if he will and he is about to leave for a few weeks (we <br/>\nwill miss him yes, but it will offer some reprieve).  I should stop <br/>\nrambling, I just know we are doing the right thing, but my dh&#39;s <br/>\nsupport is wearing off.
