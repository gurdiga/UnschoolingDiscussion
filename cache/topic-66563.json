Most people,<br/>\nmost of the time, like to do things themselves competently and<br/>\neasily.  Each day a child can and will master new skills of adult<br/>\nliving, unless you stop them.  For myself, I see it as a loop or<br/>\nprocess.<br/>\n<br/>\n- First the child can&#39;t - then I will absolutely and with no<br/>\nhesitation.<br/>\n- Second a child can, but doesn&#39;t know how - the I will do it<br/>\nwith, alongside, watching from the sidelines as cheerleader or<br/>\nwhatever so the child can; I may still do it when speed or<br/>\nprecision matters.  That&#39;s why getting dressed to go to a wedding<br/>\nis supervised long after getting dressed to play in the back yard<br/>\nis ignored.  This is a tough spot and will lead to some days that<br/>\nall of the laundry comes out pink - and to days of tempery &quot;I CAN<br/>\nDO IT, MOM&quot; when judgments about ability differ.<br/>\n-Third a child can and does regularly<br/>\n- Fourth Mom doing it for them is a gift of love, just like the<br/>\ncup of coffee they bring me in bed at some point.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil they can do it, every time I do it is a bit of keeping<br/>\npower and competency as my own special kingdom.  There are things<br/>\nthat I do believe it is my right to keep as my own kingdom<br/>\nbecause the kids is not yet ready - our 6 y.o. is allowed to<br/>\nstart the car, but not drive it.  But I look at the things I do<br/>\nthrough the filter of how they keep the child from learning to<br/>\nmaster the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rubyprincesstsg@...\">rubyprincesstsg@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 29, 2003 8:04 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Math phobia, again<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| In a message dated 4/29/2003 1:01:20 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n| <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marji@...\">marji@...</a> writes:<br/>\n|<br/>\n| &gt; I believe that unschooling works best when we moms get our<br/>\ndesires out of<br/>\n| &gt; the picture.  In fact, I&#39;d say that where parenting is<br/>\nconcerned, that is<br/>\n| &gt; true overall, but in order for unschooling to happen in its<br/>\nmost beautiful<br/>\n| &gt; way, we need to let go of what WE want so our kids can become<br/>\nmore familiar<br/>\n| &gt;<br/>\n| &gt; with what THEY want, and set their goals, and dream, and form<br/>\nplans, and<br/>\n| &gt; all that.<br/>\n| &gt;<br/>\n|<br/>\n| So if WE WANT to see them happy, We WANT to do things to honor<br/>\ntheir being,<br/>\n| as long as I keep doing things that make them happy because I<br/>\nWANT to it&#39;s<br/>\n| not good?  See just when I think I understand it I really<br/>\ndon&#39;t.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| OK,  I do certain things that I know they like because I know<br/>\nit makes them<br/>\n| happy. BUT am I somehow impeding their growth by doing these<br/>\nthings without<br/>\n| them specifically asking?  Or is it just selfish thing to<br/>\ncontinue to do the<br/>\n| things for them?<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Do you all plan special things for your children without them<br/>\nasking?  How do<br/>\n| you go about it so that it is not something about YOU and is<br/>\ncompletely for<br/>\n| the child?<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Or is it simply enough to say, I love having my two grown<br/>\nchildren come home<br/>\n| for dinner every night with the rest of the family so I will<br/>\njust continue to<br/>\n| cook meals that they enjoy?  Whatever the outcome, they get fed<br/>\nand loved and<br/>\n| sent back out into the world for another day, so what if it&#39;s<br/>\nall about me?<br/>\n| Or do I try to find some other place to be?  That I don&#39;t do<br/>\nthings unless<br/>\n| requested?<br/>\n|<br/>\n| I really really don&#39;t want any of this to be about ME, that<br/>\nwould defeat my<br/>\n| entire purpose of parenting.
