She was read to quit after 1<br/>\nweek, but we stuck with it for a month.  I was rather relieved when she<br/>\ndecided she didn&#39;t want to go to school and especially happy about her<br/>\nreasons.  She didn&#39;t like being told what to do and when(wasn&#39;t used to<br/>\nit).  She wanted to complete whatever project she was working on at the<br/>\ntime(coloring, building blocks, etc.,) rather than stop just because it<br/>\nwas story time, or whatever.  I guess I have been unschooling all along,<br/>\nI just hadn&#39;t labeled it as such. <br/>\n<br/>\n\tHere is what I really couldn&#39;t believe or understand about her<br/>\nKindergarten class.  They were teaching them math!  I mean everyday they<br/>\nhad to sit down at the table as soon as they came to class(5 & 6<br/>\nyr.olds), and do an equation.  That means they had to not only write it<br/>\nout on a piece of paper(many of these children were just learning how to<br/>\nwrite #&#39;s and letters and had a VERY difficult time with this exercise),<br/>\nbut were supposed to figure it out.  The teacher would have a<br/>\nnumber(from 1-20) on the chalk board when they came in, and they were to<br/>\nsit down and figure out what + what = that number. Oh they had number<br/>\nlines, and little +/= signs, and manipulatives to help them to figure it<br/>\nout(and 1-3 adults), but they were too young to be force fed these<br/>\nconcepts!  I was apalled.  The teacher explained to me one day how and<br/>\nwhy this was good for them, and I new I was ready to take my daughter<br/>\nhome and keep her there.  These kids, for the most part, did not(could<br/>\nnot) understand what they were doing.  It was frustrating and boring for<br/>\nthem.  My dd tried her best, but this was the first thing she didn&#39;t<br/>\nlike about school and the way she experienced it was this:  She told me<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t like &quot;doing math&quot;, that she felt she wasn&#39;t learning at<br/>\nschool, and was beginning to think she was not very smart since she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t understand what was being &quot;taught&quot; her(actually they were told to<br/>\ndo, without being taught, and then might get some help).  This was very<br/>\ntroubling to me, so I told my dd not to worry about &quot;math&quot;, that she was<br/>\ntoo young(vs.stupid) to understand it, and it didn&#39;t matter, just do the<br/>\nbest she could without worry(ya right), and concentrate on having fun,<br/>\nbecause that was what she was supposed to be doing.  This helped a<br/>\nlittle, but it didn&#39;t take away her worry and the fact that this was<br/>\nwhittling away at her self esteem, at 5 years old.  IT MADE ME WANT TO<br/>\nSCREAM!  For the life of me, I can&#39;t believe they do that to those<br/>\nchildren.  I am so glad my kids do not have to be put through that for<br/>\ntheir entire childhood.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, and since bringing her back home with me and her brother where she<br/>\nbelongs and is free to learn  what she wants, when she wants, in the way<br/>\nthat is best for her, she has bounced back to her happy little carefree<br/>\nand very independent 6 year old self.  I am so proud of my children.  I<br/>\njust felt like sharing that experience with people who might appreciate<br/>\nthe way that I felt, and who understand the way that we live.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1016,"nextTopicId":1037}}
