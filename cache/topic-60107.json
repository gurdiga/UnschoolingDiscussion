When my boys are around like minded children you can see the <br/>\nexcitement.  No one harping or nagging.  They aren&#39;t worrying about what <br/>\ntheir Mom will say.  I get that way when I see my brother, we usually don&#39;t <br/>\nsee each other but every couple of years and we stay up late talking etc.  <br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"kids not helping and Moms losing it","postDate":"1046841574","msgId":60107,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExLmJjYmMzZjguMmI5NmUyZTZAY3MuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":60130,"prevInTime":60106,"nextInTime":60108,"topicId":60107,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/4/03 8:43:50 PM Central Standard Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2003226986\">In a message dated 3/4/03 8:43:50 PM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; <br/>\n Ren, did you ask the kids why things went the way they did when their <br/>\nfriends <br/>\n were there? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was really my fault.<br/>\nIt really got me pissed off at the time, but like most scenarios, I see where <br/>\nI was to blame once I back away and get some perspective.<br/>\nI was totally relaxed the whole time the friends were over. This is another <br/>\nunschooling family so the kids are absolutely awesome and very close to my <br/>\nkids.<br/>\nI fixed them food and brought it to them while they played video games. They <br/>\nall crashed in the living room at various times (mostly in the early morning:)<br/>\nI don&#39;t stress about mess when kids are hanging out, it&#39;s just more fun to <br/>\nhang out and play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo after they went home, my kids were exhausted. They were totally, <br/>\ncompletely wiped out. So cleaning up after themselves to any degree was not a <br/>\npriority of course.<br/>\nI did recognize some of that at the time because I remember saying &quot;I didn&#39;t <br/>\nchoose to ignore my sleep needs!!&quot;<br/>\nThey love these friends so much that they do this everytime they get <br/>\ntogether. They just love their time and don&#39;t want to waste it sleeping. They <br/>\nsee each other weekly most of the time...we&#39;d spent the day at a Renaissance <br/>\nfestival just the day before, but when ya really like someone, I guess sleep <br/>\nis NOT the priority at all.<br/>\nSo my relaxed state in the midst of mess only lasts so long. And I just <br/>\nwasn&#39;t clear enough about warning them that I was starting to get <br/>\nstressed...it just built up.<br/>\nI need to give very clear information before I get stressed, as someone said <br/>\nbefore.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were simply exhausted and wanted to be waited on a bit. And I was <br/>\nexhausted too and didn&#39;t want to help anyone anymore.<br/>\nBad timing, tired people, Mom with too much going on....it all led up to a <br/>\nrough couple of days. But I have to look at the big picture and the happy <br/>\nhousehold that we have most days.  Blow ups were WAY more common before I <br/>\nlearned to apply unschooling philosophies to other areas of life.<br/>\nNow they seem to be the exception, and every time I learn a bit more about <br/>\nmyself and how I can do better.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>\ngrowing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.
