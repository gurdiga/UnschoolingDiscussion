In short, what I said was that a man cannot expect a woman to run <br/>\nall of the household duties and service him too.  The old, you can&#39;t have <br/>\nyour cake and eat it too thing.  My hubby would try desparately to sit on the <br/>\ncouch by at least 9:00 and remain there for the evening.  this is not my idea <br/>\nof romance, relaxing, or good use of time.  So I took this time to do <br/>\nsomething I needed to do.  he can&#39;t come back now and complain about it... I <br/>\ntried to get him out of it, he demands that he is entittled to that time.  <br/>\nSo, isn&#39;t it somewhat strange that the time I demanded for myself is indeed <br/>\nspent working.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doth think that some of the hubby population gets too comfortable and sees <br/>\nus more as furniture than as partners.  You can&#39;t ignore me, then when I go <br/>\naway, call me back.  I&#39;m out of here!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for us, I will not sacrifice my boys&#39; day anymore for the work, that is <br/>\nwhy I quit a year ago...to be with the boys and be an active parent.  So now <br/>\nthat I am back, I do have to make sure that the work schedule doesn&#39;t prevent <br/>\nmy parenting or their exploration and branching on interests.  Though I did <br/>\nnot want this schedule, I do seem to be able to get more of my household <br/>\nduties done and keep on top of things better.  The work I do is good too <br/>\nbecause I am very creative after the sun goes down.  All in all, I do feel a <br/>\nbit more focused and somewhat more productive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be scary for my hubby to have to interact with the boys so much <br/>\nnow...I say tough!  He should have been doing it a long time ago...and not <br/>\njust during baseball season!  He will get used to it, he will find other cool <br/>\nlittle people to snuggle with &lt;g&gt;.  And he will be loved and remembered as a <br/>\ngood Pop to his boys.  And he will be able to play a lot more now too and <br/>\nhave more fun.  I do think hubbies have to learn their are other ways to <br/>\nrelax and interacting with your family isn&#39;t work!  I don&#39;t get to play, I <br/>\nhave to work :o(<br/>\n<br/>\nI may have gone to the opposite extreme here on being harsh with the hubby.  <br/>\nBut I know a lot of us homeschooling moms don&#39;t get the help and support we <br/>\nneed from our spouses to do this.   Asking Dad to take over bedtime routine, <br/>\neven if we aren&#39;t working another job, isn&#39;t asking too much in my book.  We <br/>\ndo have to work on our partnership that we committed our lives to.  But that <br/>\npartnership does have to work for her as well as him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can sacrifice myself into a hole where I simply don&#39;t exist for myself <br/>\nanymore.  or I can demand to have some value for myself and enjoy some of <br/>\nwhat life has to offer too.  I have supported and helped my husband get more <br/>\njoy out of his life.  I insisted he do no more side work, just his straight <br/>\n40, and that he take his moments to re-energize and heal from the day.  He is <br/>\na good man and he does love his job.  I also got back into this job to ensure <br/>\nthat he would not have to take on side work to meet any of our needs and we <br/>\ncan live comfortably, enjoy traveling and learning on the road, and do big <br/>\nprojects like we have dreamed of.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do love my hubby intensely, and he loves me intensely.  we have a good <br/>\nmarriage.  Bu things can&#39;t just work for him, they have to work for me too.  <br/>\nThis sometimes means sacrifices and biting your tongue for the good of the <br/>\nother.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I will try to get my work done as quickly as possible in as few hours as I <br/>\ncan.  That I can try.  I don&#39;t work the weekend evenings and usually let one <br/>\nweeknight fly also.  Now I am behind and am in panic to catch up.  So I need <br/>\nto commit to my time for my work and stop worrying about hubby.  he is a big <br/>\nboy now, he can handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just as an example to those who may feel I am being unfair or unloving to <br/>\nmy hubby.  I took Friday night off..we watched a movie... nothing else.  I <br/>\ntook Saturday night off, the boys spent the night over friends .... and we <br/>\nwatched TV, until 12:30 AM...nothing else.  I took Sunday night off, our 12th <br/>\nwedding anniversary, we got home from my folks around 10:00 PM, he watched <br/>\nsome TV so i went online for a bit...nothing else.  So, tonight I am going <br/>\nback to my work schedule, guilt-free, and wanting to hear no more on this <br/>\n&quot;but you don&#39;t spend time with me&quot; nonsense.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he will miss me by Thursday &lt;g&gt;.  he and the children have me from 5:00 <br/>\nPm till 8:00 Pm too.  So I don&#39;t think this deal is too bad for any of us.  <br/>\nExcept me who has to start work at 8:00 Pm at night!  Well, hubby has to take <br/>\nthe boys to Pokemon League on Tuesdays and Thursdays starting this week.  And <br/>\nthe boys spend Wednesday evening at church.  So maybe all of this will <br/>\nactually smooth itself out in the next couple of weeks.  My schedule should <br/>\nactually slow down after this intitial development and grantwriting crunch.  <br/>\nThen 3 nights a week may be all I will need to get my work done ... maybe.... <br/>\nor am I just dreaming....<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry so long.  I just feel very strong about this subject.  I have given so <br/>\nmuch to others that there is very little left of me.  And what is left is <br/>\nscreaming out in defense of her existence.
