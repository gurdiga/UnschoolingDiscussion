I fully blame the pack mentality within the<br/>\ngovernment school system to be a major part of the<br/>\nreasons why my brothers and I are not close. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Sarah had started kindergarten, she really got a<br/>\nkick out of having a baby brother and a newborn<br/>\nsister. It didn&#39;t take very long at all for her to<br/>\npick up on the viewpoint that siblings are supposed to<br/>\nbe an annoyance. Sadly, it took a little longer for<br/>\nher to lose that attitude than it did for her to pick<br/>\nit up!! <br/>\n<br/>\nI treasure when they are doing things together. Sarah<br/>\nread to Logan for an hour and a half last night before<br/>\nbedtime, going through every Dr Suess book more than<br/>\nonce, and some others as well. Every time I turned<br/>\naround one of them was running to the bookshelf to<br/>\npull out more books. It was great! <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now Sarah, Logan and Megan are all curled up<br/>\ntogether watching the YuGiOh movie on DVD. <br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n--- Angela S &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; *\t<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s really starting to bug me that so little value<br/>\n&gt; is placed on the <br/>\n&gt; interaction within the family!. <br/>\n&gt; *\t-----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Often people are surprised that my girls enjoy each<br/>\n&gt; other so much.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fostering healthy sibling relationships is very<br/>\n&gt; important and can be very<br/>\n&gt; rewarding to the kids.
