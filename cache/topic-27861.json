I am a very vehemently<br/>\n  inclined UNschooler.<br/>\n  My husband is an sweet, but slightly anal retentive<br/>\n  overachiever who insists on <br/>\n  workbook type curriculum so he can track our dd&#39;s progress.<br/>\n  We tried compromising<br/>\n  by getting the Life Pac series of workbooks (as recommended<br/>\n  by a homeschooling <br/>\n  friend in NH).  <br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s killing me.  Every other paragraph lists a scripture<br/>\n  and this stuff is so jam packed <br/>\n  with dogma even the child is a-moanin!  (For ex. in a<br/>\n  chapter on hygiene in the Health<br/>\n  book they spent 4 pages examining a chapter in Ephesians<br/>\n  that talks about obeying<br/>\n  your parents.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I hope I have not offended anyone with this but the fact is<br/>\n  I&#39;m not looking for bible<br/>\n  classes. I would gleefully go back to ordering from<br/>\n  Carolina, but dh is also right that<br/>\n  the cost is AMAZING.  I just want something that helps her<br/>\n  focus on getting the job done, learning<br/>\n  about health, provoking discussions and more learning and<br/>\n  giving dh the workbook<br/>\n  type recording he is looking for. Is this just too tall an<br/>\n  order?  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Any suggestions or thoughts?  Anybody?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks, Jacli<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
