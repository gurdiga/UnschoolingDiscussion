To appease is not to address the <br/>\nproblem, but to offer the same emotional support and respect as I do to my <br/>\nkids or any one else I know seems to be the way. I found that I (this is not <br/>\nConnie&#39;s story necessarily, only my own) tended to expect him to operate in a <br/>\nvacuum, on his own, when it suddenly occured to me that he also had <br/>\nstruggles. His parents did not do a bang-up job with his emotional dev. as a <br/>\nkid, to say the least. I have felt closer to   him as a result of this, and I <br/>\nbelieve it sends the kids more of a message of respect for others when I <br/>\noffer it to my husband. This does not mean that I let him bulldoze me or the <br/>\nlittle guys.<br/>\nConnie, it sounds like you have a huge crisis on your hands. I really feel <br/>\nfor you, and it sounds like  your partner is not able to hear what  you are <br/>\ntrying to say or do.<br/>\nI really hope you have some support around you, and are able to get through <br/>\nthis with  your self and kids somewhat intact!!<br/>\nThinking of you, from far away!<br/>\nNancy in BC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61411,"nextTopicId":61425}}
