Not one person has even complemented him on that decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you&#39;re right your dh does most definitely deserve a big pat on the back because<br/>\nhe is trying to stretch - a truly difficult task.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just<br/>\n&gt; wanted more information about LLL so I could help him with any ?? he may<br/>\n&gt; have in the future. That didn&#39;t even happen. I know that this entire process<br/>\n&gt; has been a joint venture, DH and I, since I could not get pregnant without a<br/>\n&gt; medical staff (and DH). Since EVERYTHING regarding a pregnancy has been a<br/>\n&gt; joint effort, why is it not right for him to join in the bonding and<br/>\n&gt; feeding?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you&#39;re a family i think consensus and flexibility are vital to maintaining a<br/>\nhealthy bond/foundation.  i also expressed milk just so my dh could feed/bond<br/>\nfrom the very beginning, he loved it and imo it was worth it.  we just made<br/>\nsure we got good bottles that made rene&#39; work a bit, like breastfeeding, so he<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t get &#39;lazy&#39; and want only the bottle.  if we had to do it again we<br/>\nwould do it the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I hope that since this is my DH we are speaking about, that this<br/>\n&gt; would now go to the dead topic section, for it is a finished topic in our<br/>\n&gt; home.<br/>\n&gt; Thank you for all your opinions-<br/>\n&gt; Ron and Stephanie<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>well breastfeeding as a topic goes way beyond your dh he is actually mild<br/>\ncompared to many people and men in particular.  breastfeeding has become both a<br/>\npublic and a private issue and is highly emotional.  i hope your dh does not<br/>\ntake the discussion personal.<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin,tx<br/>\n&#39;unity through diversity&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; LOW RATE, NO WAIT!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
