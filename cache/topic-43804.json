It&#39;s been a long battle <br/>\nfor Mirial, from refusing ritalin, to having a counselor visit our <br/>\nhome 3 times a week, and daycare 2 times a week (this is before <br/>\nMirial was in school), to the neighbors calling social workers on me <br/>\nbecause they see my children at home all the time, to the teachers <br/>\ncalling social workers on me because I refused to give permission for <br/>\nMariah to be evaluated (I have my own child psychologist to eavluate <br/>\nif needed)to my family telling me I&#39;m harming the kids by taking them <br/>\nout of school.  When Iknow deep down in my gut, I am doing the right <br/>\nthing for them both.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I know it would be easier if I only had Mariah to teach, I have <br/>\neven had friends tell me to put mirial in crossroads so I could focus <br/>\non the &quot;Smart&quot; child when i teach.  I refuse to do that.  That&#39;s like <br/>\nadmitting defeat and giving up on my baby.  I just can&#39;t do that. <br/>\n<br/>\nOK back to my studies on Georgia legal issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank You so much, you ladies areall the greates bunchof people to <br/>\nhave patience with all my questions and concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaria</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":30108381,"authorName":"Maria","from":"&quot;Maria&quot; &lt;lyciall@...&gt;","profile":"lyciall","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: This is it!!!","postDate":"1031871501","msgId":43846,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFscjY2ZCttbmp2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNEODExQTU5LkRDQjA2RkIxQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":43845,"nextInTopic":43847,"prevInTime":43845,"nextInTime":43847,"topicId":43804,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

An average day at our house can look <br/>\nlike just about anything, but here are some things my kids do. Others here <br/>\ncan tell you about things their kids do, and they will all be different.<br/>\nMy son Jack spends hours on the Playstation2. That is how he learned to read <br/>\nthis year. He loves his gaming magazines and he would get tired of asking <br/>\nsomeone to read it to him all the time. My dd, Moly spends hours watching <br/>\nbirds, she and I take early morning walks to the river so we can watch *our* <br/>\ncranes. She loves Harry Potter too. She spends hours playing with her trading <br/>\ncards. We play games, (tons of games) read books, the kids play on the <br/>\ncomputer, both love to help me cook, (and I am getting over my *no one else <br/>\nin the kitchen but me*  &lt;g&gt;) both kids love to ride their bikes and we have <br/>\ngreat walking/biking trails around here. Jack does have one *lesson* he goes <br/>\nto Karate three mornings a week. Both are active in scouting. Moly&#39;s Junior <br/>\nGirl Scouts will start their meetings next week and she is so excited to see <br/>\nall her friends. Moly has some penpalls she likes to exchange letters with. <br/>\nOur days are filled with things the kids want to do and play. I have my <br/>\nhobbies and interests too.

My son was the same way but I thought he had ADD.  My doctor said no,  he doesn&#39;t have ADD, he can focus on things.  And when he does look out!  And on the other hand if I suggest something I think he might like, NO WAY!  It really has to be his idea or nothing.  That is why unschooling worked for us.  He fits your description in the last e-mail,  he&#39;s amazing in math, computer but also can play an instrument like this(snap of finger).  <br/>\nI think all of us that are just starting this process really need to just relax, relax, relax, and relax!
