In the case of my daughter&#39;s friend, I had them talk to each other because that is what my daughter wanted.  I talked to her mom because in this particular situation I knew I could.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut with other kids who have been here, I have confronted kids and told them they need to go home unless or until they can stop x behavior.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I find happens so much of the time here though is that many of the friends deny any wrong doing, or my own kids don&#39;t really want the friend to leave so I feel as though my hands are tied.

Its like we are a magnet for this stuff.  Of all the &quot;friends&quot; they have, very few are simply &quot;nice kids&quot; that don&#39;t have a ton of baggage attatched.  The vast majority all have behavior or discipline problems of one kind or another, and its not just the schools that are the cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the older ones are getting harder to persuade in a kind way to behave appropriately.  Some of them think everything is a big joke when I try to talk to them in a nice way.  I don&#39;t like the idea that these kids don&#39;t take *any* authority figure seriously.  I don&#39;t think of myself as an &quot;authority figure&quot;, but this is *our* home and I definitely feel taken advantage of lately.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts getting to the point where I&#39;m feeling the need to limit friendships in order to save my own kids from being dragged down with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, June 04, 2003 8:38 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Sticking it out with &quot;friends&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve had really good luck with talking directly to the friends.

He had always been in a group of three or more and the <br/>\n  communication was never straight between him and Julie.  They talked about dance, <br/>\n  and siblings (and each knows the others&#39;), and depending on others, and social <br/>\n  life, and the future (cars, jobs, places to live).   <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

This is a little long, so I apologize in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 11 year old daughter and her neighbor friend (who is 10) grew up together and are both very competitive.  Over the years I knew this child was lying about a lot of things, often in an effort to either control my daughter or to control how my daughter&#39;s other friends perceive my daughter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring these times I gave my daughter strategies for handling the situations and often reminded her that she does not have to put up with this stuff, but she might not want to burn any bridges.  After all, at this age, friends grow together, apart, and together again.  Sometimes my daughter would &quot;take a break&quot; for awhile, but they always reunited.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, fortunately, her mother and I have a very good friendship.  Awhile ago, as the girls were getting older, we decided that we would stay out of the girls&#39; problems getting along.  We would be there to listen to each of them complain, and we would offer support and suggestions for how to solve the problem.  But we would not intervene. We&#39;ve been doing this for about 2? years now. This seems to be working pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust this week, they have been fighting again, more nasty lies, etc.  These two are supposed to go to resident camp together in a few weeks.  This could be a REAL problem.  (They signed up as &quot;buddies&quot;).  So, my daughter and I talked about this.  She came up with a few ideas for solutions.  Then she went to her friend and mentioned to her that she wasn&#39;t sure they should go together to camp since they will probably fight the whole time, to which the other girl agreed that was a possibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter they had talked a bit about it, I called the mom.  She was already aware that the two had been fighting a lot, and I think she must have been aware that my daughter was thinking about canceling the camping thing.  In fact, her daughter had asked *her* to call *me* but she wanted to wait until I called her.  I take it as a compliment that she trusted me to call her...and didn&#39;t feel the need to jump on the phone and get upset.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe and I discussed it and she was perfectly ok with whatever my daughter decided, agreeing that it could be a bad thing if they go together.  I discussed my daughter&#39;s ideas with her and asked her what she thought.  We decided to let the girls discuss it on their own some more and try to come up with their own solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls have since decided they will go together as buddies, but *they* will tell the counselors ahead of time that if they start fighting, the counselors should separate them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought that was a pretty mature way to handle it and try to keep everyone happy...on both their parts.  In fact, the friend&#39;s response was &quot;I think we should work our problem out.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, it definitely requires parents who are on the same page and who can support each other even when their kids are hurting each other.  We have to put our mother bear instincts on the back burner long enough to help our kids work their own problems out...and granted, our kids are a little older than the kids in the original situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSOOOO, in spite of the difficulties, and the many things we differ on, she is a rare gem of a friend to me.   (She always has her best face on, and refuses to hand wash dishes, while I&#39;m raishing a pig and chickens in my back yard (she got a big kick out of telling her family about that LOL).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe both hope our friendship is an example to our girls that its ok to be different with different values, and still be really good friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:genant2@...\">genant2@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, June 03, 2003 10:00 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Sticking it out with &quot;friends&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 6/3/03 2:51:52 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:arodonn@...\">arodonn@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; However, she then started talking about homeschool moms keeping their kid&#39;s <br/>\n  &gt; sheltered from kids that they have trouble with.

I have left a job in the past because of a stressful work <br/>\nenvironment.

They are both 5, have known each other about a year and primarily see each other at a weekly play group.  In the last couple months, though, there have been issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavan is the sort of kid who yells when upset.  So, when something goes wrong at play group, she yells at the other kids.  The other kids, meanwhile, either get quiet and retreat or come to their mom&#39;s when they get upset, so Davan&#39;s pretty different in that.  Willa told her mom, just as the trouble between her and Davan started, that she was upset about Davan&#39;s yelling and just doesn&#39;t know what to do.  Willa&#39;s mom relayed this to me, to which I said that I knew the yelling was a problem and we do try to work on it and I pretty much didn&#39;t know what to tell her.  Her mom said, &quot;We value your friendships and we aren&#39;t going anywhere, but it&#39;s a problem.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSense this conversation, Willa has ignored Davan or outright told her that she wanted to play with Ellie (another girl at play group) and not Davan.  Davan will ask her a question and Willa will just turn away.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s desirable behavior, either, but Davan and I seem to be the only ones it bothers, where as Davan&#39;s yelling is obviously a problem to everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavan and I have taken a bit of a break from the playgroup due to a trip out of town and Memorial Day happening.  So, it had been 3 weeks sense we were last at playgroup and the dynamic had been Davan being left out of the Davan/Ellie/Willa group at the last two playgroups prior to our break.  Davan had had a bit of a hard time with this, but did okay with just playing with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday was out first day back and things came to a head for me.  Davan and Ellie were playing very well together and Willa was feeling left out, even though Davan and Ellie had invited her to play with them.  It was fairly obvious that Willa wanted Ellie to play with her alone without Davan.  Eventually, the three of them, plus Griffon (Willa&#39;s 3 year old brother) were playing upstairs while the adults were all downstairs with the babies.  We heard someone crying - it sounded like a baby and we all looked around to make sure non of them had gone up the stairs, but they were all with us.  Willa&#39;s mom thought it was Griffon, at that point and took off up the stairs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was Willa.  Willa told her mom that &quot;they&quot; had put something around her neck and were pulling, strangling her.  Willa&#39;s mom told the kids that was totally unacceptable and brought the crying and very distressed looking/sounding Willa downstairs with her.  The feeling was, obviously, that Willa was telling the complete truth and that Davan was responsible.  I even bought into it, much to my shame!  Even Ellie was saying, &quot;It was Davan&#39;s plan!  It was Davan&#39;s plan!&quot; over and over.  I accused Davan of putting her robe tie (which she&#39;d been wearing around her waste, but was then off) around Willa&#39;s neck, which Davan denied.  Davan told me, &quot;I don&#39;t even want to talk to someone as silly as you!&quot; and turned away.  While I wish she&#39;d just told me outright what had happened, I can&#39;t blame her for this, as I was unjustly accusing her.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe ended up telling me (and this was later collaborated by Ellie and Willa, both) that Willa was pretending to sleep on the couch and Ellie and Davan were trying to wake her up.  This escalated to them trying to pull her off the couch by her shirt.  The interesting thing here is that Davan was not touching Willa at all.  It had, apparently, been Davan&#39;s plan to pull Willa off the couch (thus Ellie&#39;s mantra), but it was most definitely Ellie pulling on Willa.  I guess that the shirt being pulling was tight around her neck.  However, no one ever put anything around Willa&#39;s neck and Davan never hurt her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter Ellie apologized and I was still talking to Davan about what had happened, Ellie and Willa went off to play together.  When Davan showed up, saying she was sorry to Willa (which she chose to do because Willa was so upset).  Willa again just ignored Davan.  Ellie invited Davan to join in their play and Davan agreed.  Willa then told Davan, &quot;My nose was bleeding from being strangled!&quot;  Which was simply untrue.  The other moms showed up where the girls were playing in time to hear Ellie&#39;s version (identical to Davan&#39;s) about what had happened and Willa then said that they hadn&#39;t put anything around her neck, after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWilla&#39;s mom then said, as if to find something to blame Davan for, &quot;It sounds like they didn&#39;t put anything around Willa&#39;s neck.  When I was bringing Willa downstairs, though, Davan said, &#39;Yeah!  Take her away!  We don&#39;t want to play with a crybaby!&quot;  Now, this isn&#39;t a nice thing to say, but in light of what was an attention getting move on Willa&#39;s part, maybe wasn&#39;t that off base.  We are working on not using hurtful names, just like the yelling.  Davan does forget in the heat of the moment, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhew!  This has turned out much longer than I expected!  I was just going to say that Davan had trouble with a friend, causing both the friend&#39;s mom and myself to often assume Davan was the one &quot;doing wrong&quot;.  I decided after yesterday, after this last incident, that this isn&#39;t a good situation for Davan to be in and we were not going to go to playgroup anymore because of this situation.  When I told Ellie&#39;s mom of this, but that we would like to see Ellie another time during the week, she was supportive if I felt I needed to do it for Davan&#39;s sake.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, she then started talking about homeschool moms keeping their kid&#39;s sheltered from kids that they have trouble with.  That maybe one thing that was good about public school is that kids have to work things out with kids they don&#39;t get along with and that prepares them for getting along with co-workers they don&#39;t like later.  What do you think about this?  I&#39;m thinking that it might be easier to learn to get along with unpleasant co-workers if you have a solid foundation of acceptance in childhood, but maybe I&#39;m thinking faultily.  I also feel like this isn&#39;t just a problem with not getting along, but of Davan being in a situation where she&#39;s the &quot;bad one&quot; in the eyes of the other kid&#39;s parent and sometimes even mine when I&#39;m with them.  This can&#39;t be good for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I&#39;ve poured this all out.  Thanks for making it this far and I&#39;d appreciate some feedback.
