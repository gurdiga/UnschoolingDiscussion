Jackie was invited to go rollerskating with a freind, leaving us alone for a few hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithin a few minutes after starting the movie, Lisa&#39;s friend Allison came over.  Her mom limits her movie intake, so I first called her mom to ask if she could watch with us.  She didn&#39;t answer, so I sent Allison home to ask.  The answer was no.  The mom said she had seen the movie and it disturbed her.  (Later, after I watched it, I talked to her mom some more and found out that she didn&#39;t watch it to the end.  I told her that was the best part!)  Lisa told Allison she could play later, but wanted to watch the movie then, while Jackie was gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe night before, Jackie had pulled a twin mattress and a bunch of pillows onto the living room floor.  We started the movie on the couch with snackes, then moved to the mattress to watch the rest.  Lisa&#39;s friend had seen The Sixth Sense recently and had warned about some &quot;cover your eyes&quot; parts.  It helped to have all those extra blankets and pillows handy!<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout the movie we talked about it.  At the end we watched the extras on the DVD, then went back to look at a couple scenes to see how we had missed that the Doctor (sorry, I&#39;m not going to tell.  You&#39;ll have to watch it to see for yourself!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe decided the movie wasn&#39;t &quot;scary&quot; so much as it had a fair amount of gore and the shock of the ghosts appearing suddenly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for all the tips!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\nPS I&#39;m still watching The Day The Earth Stood Still (1957 movie where an alien space ship lands on Earth in 1951).

Up to this point the *scariest* things we&#39;ve watched are the 3 Harry Potter movies.  And Snow White.  Lisa was disturbed by the witch in the Disney version.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe this desire was prompted by some friends seeing scary movies and telling her about them.  I&#39;d also shared with her the email about music in scary movies.  We watched Jaws together (dh, me, & kids) recently when dh happened upon it channel surfing, and we talked a lot about what to expect, special effects, and gave the kids warning on parts they may not want to see.  We offered to not watch it at all if they preferred that.  (We&#39;d both seen it years ago, but not recently.)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has a number of friends whose parents have convoluted rules about which movie ratings they are allowed to watch.  I&#39;ve always considered content over ratings when choosing movies for my kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only two movies that really terrified me were The Excorcist and The Shining.  (OK, the ending of the 1st Harry Potter with the double faces freaked me a bit.)  I&#39;ve enjoyed Sandra&#39;s comments about her experience vs. her kid&#39;s with The Excorcist.  Lisa has had lots of questions about my experience with these movies.  Today I told her that The Excorcist scared me because at the time I believed in The Devil, but I don&#39;t have that belief any more.  I told her about some of the freaky parts - head spinning and split pea puke - and how it would probably seem corny to me now.  I explained what an excorcism is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe checked the library first.  They didn&#39;t have anything she wanted (though they do have The Excorcist and The Shining both on DVD!) but I grabbed a video copy of The Day The Earth Stood Still: Aliens Invade the Earth, from 1957.  It looks like it might be fun for some cheesy special effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext we went to the video store where we browsed covers until Lisa chose The Sixth Sense.  She said that most scary movies have THE in the title.  Her friend saw this movie and has told her about it.  We&#39;ve been talking about the parts her friend told her about -  Grandma says hello.  I see dead people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you to whoever mentioned watching such movies in the am, rather than right before bed - was that here?<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa also went to screen-it dotcom and read about this movie and some others.  She told me about The Forgotten, in which a child dies and everyone except the mother acts as if the child never existed.  She mentioned another movie where the F word is spoken a bazillion times.  We joked about a future will people will say &quot;F&quot; and the letter alone will be considered nasty.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy concern now is that her 9 yo sister wants to watch The Sixth Sense with us.  She is the one who is more likely to report disturbing dreams.  I&#39;m not sure what to do about having her watch it too.  I guess I was thinking we would watch it when she was busy doing something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104408,"nextTopicId":16252}}
