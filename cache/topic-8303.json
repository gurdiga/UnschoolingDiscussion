His mother supplied the answer:<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Lobbying.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; It was no idle question. The Freivalds were headed to the nation&#39;s capital<br/>\n&gt; as trainees for a little-known but potent educational lobbying force -- home<br/>\n&gt; schoolers. Soon they joined 130 home-school parents and 40 children in a<br/>\n&gt; Holiday Inn conference room, praying and singing hymns as they learned such<br/>\n&gt; techniques as researching a congressman&#39;s voting record on the Web.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;When I started home-schooling, I was worried that we were withdrawing from<br/>\n&gt; society,&quot; says another trainee, Jo Hershey of Lancaster, Pa. &quot;But now I feel<br/>\n&gt; we have the best of both worlds. We home-school, and we influence<br/>\n&gt; educational policy nationwide.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Do they ever. Although often portrayed as an isolated fringe group, parents<br/>\n&gt; who teach their children at home have become inside-the-Beltway pros,<br/>\n&gt; wielding enough clout to help block a Clinton administration bid for<br/>\n&gt; national student testing, launch their own political action committee and<br/>\n&gt; push their concerns into the midst of this year&#39;s presidential race.<br/>\n&gt; Despite relatively small numbers -- an estimated million to 1.5 million of<br/>\n&gt; the nation&#39;s 53 million schoolchildren are taught at home -- their ability<br/>\n&gt; to overwhelm Congress and state legislatures with phone calls, faxes,<br/>\n&gt; e-mails and visits has won them a unique status as educational conscientious<br/>\n&gt; objectors, in the form of exemptions from compulsory attendance laws and<br/>\n&gt; state tests.<br/>\n&gt; But home schoolers aren&#39;t content to be left alone. Suspicious of any<br/>\n&gt; federal intervention in what they consider a family matter, they are<br/>\n&gt; rallying resistance to the bipartisan coalition of government, business and<br/>\n&gt; academic leaders seeking more accountability and higher standards in K-12<br/>\n&gt; education.<br/>\n&gt; For instance, in a quiet alliance with publishers McGraw-Hill Cos. and<br/>\n&gt; Houghton Mifflin Co., home schoolers are assaulting the National Assessment<br/>\n&gt; of Educational Progress, a federal test given to a fraction of<br/>\n&gt; schoolchildren that is the preferred tool of policymakers for figuring out<br/>\n&gt; whether learning levels are rising or falling.<br/>\n&gt; Pennsylvania Congressman Bill Goodling, chairman of the House Committee on<br/>\n&gt; Education and the Workforce, calls home schoolers the most effective<br/>\n&gt; educational lobby on Capitol Hill. They frequently volunteer in his election<br/>\n&gt; campaigns. &quot;They know the issues,&quot; says Rep. Goodling. &quot;And they have an<br/>\n&gt; outstanding phone network.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; A study last year by two University of North Carolina sociologists concluded<br/>\n&gt; that home-schooling families are more likely than public-school families to<br/>\n&gt; work for political campaigns, contribute to candidates, participate in<br/>\n&gt; protests or boycotts, sign petitions and write letters to the editor. &quot;We&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; the activists,&quot; says Michael Farris, president of the 60,000-member Home<br/>\n&gt; School Legal Defense Association in Purcellville, Va.<br/>\n&gt; That activism often trumps public opinion. Ninety-two percent of Americans<br/>\n&gt; believe that home-schooled students should take the same standardized tests<br/>\n&gt; that are required of public-school students, says a 1999 Phi Delta<br/>\n&gt; Kappa/Gallup poll. Yet home-schooled children, like private-school students,<br/>\n&gt; are exempted from these tests, which public-school students in many states<br/>\n&gt; must pass to graduate.<br/>\n&gt; This exemption has emerged as an issue in the presidential campaign. The<br/>\n&gt; presumptive Republican nominee, George W. Bush, rarely misses a chance to<br/>\n&gt; espouse accountability in education. As Texas governor, he toughened<br/>\n&gt; consequences for students who do poorly on state tests. If elected<br/>\n&gt; president, he says, he will boost funding for states with high test scores<br/>\n&gt; -- and punish the laggards.<br/>\n&gt; Nevertheless, Mr. Bush was among four Republican presidential candidates who<br/>\n&gt; addressed the legal-defense association&#39;s convention last September and<br/>\n&gt; expressed support for home schooling. And Mr. Bush has made what Mr. Farris,<br/>\n&gt; who has endorsed him, calls the &quot;big promise&quot;: to shield home schoolers from<br/>\n&gt; all regulation, including testing mandates. Mr. Bush contends that home<br/>\n&gt; schoolers don&#39;t need to be held accountable in this way because they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; receive government funding.<br/>\n&gt; Mr. Bush&#39;s supporters include some prominent home-school activists: Mr.<br/>\n&gt; Farris; Tim Lambert, the Republican national committeeman from Texas and<br/>\n&gt; head of the Texas Home School Coalition; and San Antonio hospital-bed<br/>\n&gt; magnate James Leininger. Dr. Leininger, whose four children have been taught<br/>\n&gt; at home, has given at least $40,000 to Mr. Bush, $50,000 to Texas Lt. Gov.<br/>\n&gt; Rick Perry and $300,000 to other Republican committees and candidates since<br/>\n&gt; 1996, according to state and federal records.<br/>\n&gt; The Democratic National Committee says it is inconsistent for Mr. Bush to<br/>\n&gt; exempt home schoolers from tests. More surprisingly, so does Chester Finn<br/>\n&gt; Jr., a former assistant U.S. secretary of education whom Mr. Bush identifies<br/>\n&gt; as an adviser. &quot;If standards are important for all kids, they&#39;re important<br/>\n&gt; for home schoolers too,&quot; Mr. Finn says. &quot;But it&#39;s a kind of accommodation<br/>\n&gt; that America frequently makes with strong-willed minorities. They protest<br/>\n&gt; loudly, they have very vigorous fax machines and they are capable of<br/>\n&gt; mobilizing a very large fraction of their actual numbers.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Kristen Amundsen learned that the hard way. When the Democratic member of<br/>\n&gt; the Virginia House of Delegates proposed in February that home-schooled<br/>\n&gt; children take the state&#39;s Standards of Learning exams, which public-school<br/>\n&gt; students starting with the Class of 2004 must pass to receive diplomas, so<br/>\n&gt; many angry calls and e-mail messages poured into the legislature that her<br/>\n&gt; bill was scuttled without a vote. Its supporters, she says, were afraid to<br/>\n&gt; go on record against the home-school lobby.<br/>\n&gt; Fear of similar initiatives on the federal level motivates the 170 people in<br/>\n&gt; the hotel conference room who are training to be volunteer lobbyists for the<br/>\n&gt; legal-defense association. &quot;Any organization that&#39;s going to stand up and<br/>\n&gt; say, &#39;Hands off!&#39; has my support,&quot; says Elizabeth McCormick, a<br/>\n&gt; home-schooling mother from Wisconsin.<br/>\n&gt; The trainees are taught how to dress (suits for men, skirt and blouse or<br/>\n&gt; dress slacks for women), field frequently asked questions (&quot;How are you<br/>\n&gt; going to teach calculus and physics?&quot;) and access the association&#39;s online<br/>\n&gt; library and Congressional directory.<br/>\n&gt; If they pass muster with the association, the volunteers will be expected to<br/>\n&gt; spend four or five days a year on Capitol Hill, meeting each day with seven<br/>\n&gt; to 10 staffers for 20 minutes each. That includes children. The association<br/>\n&gt; encourages them to lobby with their parents so congressional staffers can<br/>\n&gt; see that they&#39;re not social misfits.<br/>\n&gt; This early introduction to politics breeds the home-school activists of the<br/>\n&gt; future. With similar foresight, Mr. Farris, the legal-defense association<br/>\n&gt; president, is opening a college in Purcellville for home-schooled students<br/>\n&gt; in September. All students at Patrick Henry College will major in<br/>\n&gt; government, and as many as possible will be placed in public-sector summer<br/>\n&gt; jobs and internships.<br/>\n&gt; The association is not popular with secular home schoolers. Many are<br/>\n&gt; alienated by its fundamentalist religious bent and three Rs approach to<br/>\n&gt; education. But the secularists also tend to be individualists. Their latest<br/>\n&gt; stab at a national organization, the National Home Education Network,<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t take positions on issues.<br/>\n&gt; Beth Richardson, a home-schooling mother, belongs to a splinter group that<br/>\n&gt; left the legal defense association&#39;s Rhode Island affiliate three years ago.<br/>\n&gt; The association fosters &quot;groupthink,&quot; she says. &quot;We feel that nobody should<br/>\n&gt; really lead, nobody should be in charge.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; In practice, such iconoclasm leaves the legal defense association as the<br/>\n&gt; home schoolers&#39; voice on Capitol Hill. Founded in 1983, it first worked in<br/>\n&gt; courts and legislatures to legalize home schooling, which came to pass in<br/>\n&gt; every state by 1993.<br/>\n&gt; That year, in response to Bill Clinton&#39;s election, the association set up<br/>\n&gt; what one official calls its &quot;one-two punch.&quot; Volunteers from nearby comb the<br/>\n&gt; Hill, as more-distant members make their views known by phone, e-mail or<br/>\n&gt; fax. Members are organized by Congressional district, with a parent<br/>\n&gt; coordinator in each.<br/>\n&gt; This system got its first test in February 1994, when George Miller, a<br/>\n&gt; Democratic representative from California, offered an amendment to an<br/>\n&gt; education bill known as HR6. Mr. Miller says he didn&#39;t intend the amendment,<br/>\n&gt; which specified that teachers must be certified in the subjects they teach,<br/>\n&gt; to apply to home-schooling parents. But the association, alarmed that the<br/>\n&gt; courts might interpret it that way, activated its network, alerting<br/>\n&gt; Christian-right radio shows as well.<br/>\n&gt; Hundreds of thousands of phone calls deluged Congress and tied up Mr.<br/>\n&gt; Miller&#39;s office lines, forcing him to resort to a voice mail recording for<br/>\n&gt; five days. The amendment, which had sailed through committee, got only one<br/>\n&gt; vote on the House floor -- Mr. Miller&#39;s. Since then, major federal education<br/>\n&gt; legislation has contained boilerplate language exempting home schoolers. And<br/>\n&gt; Mr. Miller has become a valuable bogeyman for Christian-right fund-raisers,<br/>\n&gt; who elicit home-school contributions by warning that, if the Democrats win<br/>\n&gt; back the House, he would become the education-committee chairman.<br/>\n&gt; Mr. Miller says that the association exaggerates potential dangers to<br/>\n&gt; justify collecting $100-a-year dues from members. HR6, he says, &quot;was a<br/>\n&gt; tuneup to see whether they could stampede the House. And the evidence is,<br/>\n&gt; they can.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; As a nonprofit, the legal defense association can&#39;t endorse candidates,<br/>\n&gt; because it would lose its tax-exempt status. But the line sometimes gets<br/>\n&gt; blurry. Its president, Mr. Farris, is also chairman of the Madison Project,<br/>\n&gt; a political action committee that says it funneled about $350,000 in each of<br/>\n&gt; the last two Congressional elections to conservative Republican challengers<br/>\n&gt; for Democratic-held and open seats.<br/>\n&gt; Mr. Farris expects the Madison Project to give between $20,000 and $30,000<br/>\n&gt; to each of 20 candidates this year. It is also spinning off a home-school<br/>\n&gt; political action committee to focus on key congressional races. One likely<br/>\n&gt; target: Kansas Democratic Rep. Dennis Moore. In 1983, when Mr. Moore was<br/>\n&gt; district attorney of Johnson County, Kan., he brought -- and won -- a case<br/>\n&gt; against two children for truancy because they were home schooled.<br/>\n&gt; Legislatively, home schoolers want to shrink the National Assessment of<br/>\n&gt; Educational Progress, or NAEP. &quot;This will probably be the first issue you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; be lobbying on,&quot; Christopher Klicka, senior counsel of the association,<br/>\n&gt; tells the group at the Holiday Inn. &quot;We noticed what we call &#39;NAEP creep.&#39;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s the back door for another national test attempt.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Two years ago, home schoolers joined a right-left coalition -- also<br/>\n&gt; including black and Hispanic Democrats in Congress -- to defeat the Clinton<br/>\n&gt; administration&#39;s proposal for a national test for all students. Although<br/>\n&gt; participation would have been voluntary, home schoolers predicted the test<br/>\n&gt; would spawn a national curriculum.<br/>\n&gt; Unlike that proposed test, NAEP doesn&#39;t give results for individual<br/>\n&gt; students. It provides state and national scores on various subjects, based<br/>\n&gt; on a sample of public, private and parochial school students. (Home<br/>\n&gt; schoolers haven&#39;t participated because the survey is limited to schools.)<br/>\n&gt; The nonprofit Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J., designs NAEP<br/>\n&gt; under a five-year, $75 million agreement with the federal government.<br/>\n&gt; Now, the Clinton administration and Vice President Al Gore have proposed<br/>\n&gt; extra funding for states that do well on NAEP, which is due for<br/>\n&gt; congressional reauthorization this year. (Gov. Bush would use NAEP as one of<br/>\n&gt; several measures for rewarding states.)<br/>\n&gt; Worried that NAEP will morph into a national test, home schoolers linked up<br/>\n&gt; with McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin, which fear that an expanded NAEP<br/>\n&gt; would give states and local school districts less reason to buy their<br/>\n&gt; standardized tests, now used chiefly to measure individual student<br/>\n&gt; performance.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I actually was shocked the first time I met with the test publishers,&quot; says<br/>\n&gt; Doug Domenech, director of governmental affairs for the home-school<br/>\n&gt; association. &quot;I didn&#39;t think they&#39;d buy our changes.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Executives at both CTB/McGraw-Hill, the McGraw-Hill division that sells the<br/>\n&gt; Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, and Houghton Mifflin, which sells the<br/>\n&gt; Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, confirm the alliance. Michael Kean, vice<br/>\n&gt; president of CTB/McGraw-Hill, describes NAEP as a competitor and says its<br/>\n&gt; state results are largely useless. &quot;In terms of networking in Washington,<br/>\n&gt; the home schoolers provide some access,&quot; Mr. Kean says. &quot;They carry some<br/>\n&gt; people power.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Keith Oakley agrees. As chairman of the Texas House of Representatives&#39;<br/>\n&gt; public-safety committee in 1997, he sought to repeal a law that allowed<br/>\n&gt; parents to teach their children to drive, in place of certified instructors.<br/>\n&gt; Hundreds of home-schooling families packed the legislature in protest. With<br/>\n&gt; the help of a state representative whose own son was home-schooled, the bill<br/>\n&gt; was trounced.<br/>\n&gt; Chastened, Mr. Oakley cites the defeat as part of the reason he didn&#39;t seek<br/>\n&gt; re-election in 1998. &quot;I&#39;ve still got their tire tracks on my back,&quot; he says.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------- End of forwarded message -------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Good friends, school spirit, hair-dos you&#39;d like to forget.<br/>\n&gt; Classmates.com has them all.
