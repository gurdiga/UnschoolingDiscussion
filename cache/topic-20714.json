I have a 4.5 yo ds and a 1.5 yo dd and some days they are just<br/>\ngreat - playing together like the best of pals. Some days it is really<br/>\ntough, especially when I have something I need to get done, LOL.  Today I<br/>\nwas packing for our trip, so it was one of &quot;those days&quot;. One thing I try to<br/>\ninsist on in our house is that we treat each other respectfully. Anyone who<br/>\ncan&#39;t do that can remove themselves to another room or to a quiet spot to<br/>\ncalm down (including DH and I!!). So if either one of my kids is verbally or<br/>\nphysically harming the other, if they can&#39;t work it out themselves, I ask<br/>\nthe one who is being the aggressor to come with me to another room to calm<br/>\ndown. Or, if I need to comfort the other one first, I ask the agressor to<br/>\nwait for me and then after I&#39;ve comforted the other one, I go and help them<br/>\nwork through whatever the problem is - talking about it, hugging, etc.. With<br/>\nmy two, it&#39;s not necessarily the oldest who is the most aggressive. My dd is<br/>\na biter and hair puller (which my ds never did at this age), so I have to be<br/>\nreally vigilant as she does this out of the blue. I&#39;ve also tried to give ds<br/>\nsome places that he can play where my daughter can&#39;t disturb his stuff. It<br/>\nhas to be very frustrating for him to build something up only to have her<br/>\ncome and knock it down. I&#39;ve also noticed that things are much calmer if<br/>\nthey each have some dedicated &quot;mommy time&quot; at some point during the day. My<br/>\nson gets it when my daughter naps, and my daughter usually gets it after my<br/>\nson goes to sleep (since he doesn&#39;t nap, he usually goes to sleep first and<br/>\nshe&#39;s more of a night owl). I try not to make any judgements about anything<br/>\nI don&#39;t see personally, and if the kids aren&#39;t getting along, I just take<br/>\nthe tack &quot;I see things aren&#39;t working out, why don&#39;t we play in separate<br/>\nrooms until you two feel like playing in the same space again?&quot; and they<br/>\nusually want to do that. I also remember that the book &quot;Siblings Without<br/>\nRivalry&quot; had some good suggestions, I need to re-read it now as my daughter<br/>\nis getting verbal enough to implement some of their suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your son mostly playing with the neighbors and missing mom time,<br/>\nperhaps this is part of the problem?? This is hard for me to address as our<br/>\nkids don&#39;t play at other&#39;s houses without us there, unless it&#39;s a special<br/>\noccasion and then only with one or two trusted families. Perhaps you can set<br/>\nup a special time while your daughter naps to do crafts or build with legos<br/>\nor do some one thing that your son really wants to do. If you made a<br/>\nschedule (with his input) at the beginning of the day or week, and talked to<br/>\nhim each morning about what that day&#39;s activity would be, maybe he would<br/>\nwant to do that instead of hanging with the other kids??  Just some<br/>\nthoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, I know that with kids at these ages a day can either be<br/>\nfabulously brilliant (yesterday I sat in the beautiful sunshine while my<br/>\nkids played &quot;beavers&quot; and worked together to build a beaver lodge in the<br/>\ncreek by our house with sticks) or a day can be agonizingly chaotic (today<br/>\nwhile I tried to pack, my kids took turns antagonizing each other with<br/>\nwhistles and harmonicas until the racket threatened to explode my brain).<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) inventer of new and wonderful things<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) singer of protest songs<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Betsy Hill","from":"&quot;Betsy Hill&quot; &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"HgxSGaxu0AptCAuswYc8zfrT_tTcLZg09qGlJf82EXI-sQ_aOTPFXyvGP3Sq1F-bpU6RM_tACw6Ev6hv5tZ9L7L8VZucM_3k7ugjG5w","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Constant fighting","postDate":"989259760","msgId":20741,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI3MUMzNDUyLUU1NDVAMjA5LjE3OS4yNTIuMTI+"},"prevInTopic":20718,"nextInTopic":21089,"prevInTime":20740,"nextInTime":20742,"topicId":20714,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Is there any<br/>\npushing, grabbing and yelling coming from the opposite direction?  I know<br/>\nit&#39;s more appropriate/likely at the toddler level, but that doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\nthat your son (4) will LIKE it.

You probably have to suggest possible<br/>\nreasons; 4yr olds have trouble assessing and<br/>\nverbalizing their own feelings.  At one and a half,<br/>\nhis sister is still young enough to be resented for<br/>\nthe special attention, and old enough to interfere<br/>\nwith his own independent pursuits... a particularly<br/>\nannoying combination.  Especially since girls seem to<br/>\nbe more people-pleasing, and so get more strokes<br/>\ngenerally and fewer negative feedbacks than boys do. <br/>\n*You* might understand that this may have a direct<br/>\ncorrelation to apparently controllable behavior on his<br/>\npart, but chances are your 4 yr old is not<br/>\ninternalizing it that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nFour is generally a more relational age than three...<br/>\nat three their focus is on individuating, pushing<br/>\nlimits, testing boundaries and rules; at four they<br/>\nbecome more interested again in their connections to<br/>\ntheir parents and other loved ones, in how they belong<br/>\nto and are like their parents.  The competition for<br/>\ntime and attention from you may have been subsumed a<br/>\nbit in that developmental independent pushing at age<br/>\nthree, and be more emotionally immediate for him again<br/>\nat four... generating more resentment at a time in<br/>\nwhich he has more mental and physical resources with<br/>\nwhich to express his anger and wreak revenge(and<br/>\nhopefully oust the Young Pretender).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can find the reason(s) that he is acting out,<br/>\nit will be easier to alleviate the behavior.  You can<br/>\ngive him special attention, give him special powers<br/>\nand independence that your daughter does not have,<br/>\nboth in terms relational to her (being her teacher in<br/>\nskills he has mastered, taking his word for it and<br/>\npraising when he &#39;translates&#39; for her, etc) and in<br/>\nways completely independent of her (going to movies<br/>\nwith mom or dad without her, having a different bed<br/>\ntime, being able to choose his own food, etc).  Make<br/>\nsure he has some area that is totally off-limits to<br/>\nher; all kids are territorial, and like anyone else<br/>\nhave a need for occasional quiet and solitude... make<br/>\nsure he has that opportunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then (here&#39;s the hard part) ignore the attacks...<br/>\nI don&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t snatch her away.  I mean<br/>\ntreat them matter of factly, don&#39;t react to them in an<br/>\nemotional way.  Pretend you are picking her up in<br/>\norder to put her in a chair, change her diaper,<br/>\nwhatever.  Reprimands to him or conspicuous comfort to<br/>\nher will just increase his resentment.  And the<br/>\npossibility is that at least part of the time the<br/>\n&#39;attack&#39; is actually just a four-year-old&#39;s attempt to<br/>\ninteract in an interesting way... he may simply find<br/>\nher reactions interesting or amusing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGet her out of the way, distract him with some project<br/>\nthat is more interesting and fun... and then catch him<br/>\nout at any positive interactions with her and praise<br/>\nthem conspicuously.  Any little thing.  The more good<br/>\nfeelings you can get him to connect to her and<br/>\npositive interactions with her, the better.  Start out<br/>\nby praising the tiniest positive action and gradually<br/>\nraise the bar as he gets acclimated... just like potty<br/>\ntraining.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vouget@...\">vouget@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4yods keeps grabbing things away from 1 1/2yodd, and<br/>\n&gt; pushing her, and <br/>\n&gt; yelling at her, etc.  I just don&#39;t know what to do<br/>\n&gt; anymore.
