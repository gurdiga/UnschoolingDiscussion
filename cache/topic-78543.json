My husband  is <br/>\nreally looking forward to the bike tour of Columbia on Saturday morning.    He <br/>\ncollects vintage lightweight bikes, great for touring and road travel.   He has <br/>\nover 50 bikes!  .  So, if anyone who is traveling by plane, or has no way of <br/>\ntransporting thier bike, would like to do the bike tour and needs a bike, just <br/>\nemail me and I will bring one for you.  We have all sizes, models, you name it.. <br/>\nlol.   DH and I will be traveling seperately, he will only be at the <br/>\nconference on Saturday.  We have a two  bike racks that will each hold 3 bikes and <br/>\nalso quite a few of the bikes have quick release tires that allow for easier <br/>\ntransportation.  Drop me a line and I will be glad to hook you up with a bike!<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78472,"nextTopicId":78530}}
