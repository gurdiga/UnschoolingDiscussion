It is soooo rude. Do they really<br/>\nthink I&#39;m such a creep I&#39;d do it if I didn&#39;t think it was for the best?<br/>\nBut I&#39;ve perfected the answer:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oh hell, no! But you know those little $#@%&s made me suffer so much in<br/>\nchildbirth that I decided there and then that I&#39;d make them suffer too!<br/>\nSo I keep them home and deprive them of all that neat stuff at school<br/>\njust to pay them back for all that childbirth pain. I torture them<br/>\ndaily, and I beat them several times a week to remind them what will<br/>\nhappen when we get home if they don&#39;t look real happy when we&#39;re out.<br/>\nYes sir, I&#39;m having a wonderful time making them pay for all that pain&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I finally pause to draw breath, the questioner invariably blushes<br/>\nand says &quot;I guess that was a silly question, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; And sometimes<br/>\nwe even go on to have a meaningful discussion about education!<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8929,"nextTopicId":8937}}
