I was told it<br/>\n&gt; was not complete. They want more specifics - table of contents, etc. -<br/>\n&gt; for basic communication skills. They also sent a letter saying that I<br/>\n&gt; had to have my son in public school until this is completed. He is very<br/>\n&gt; upset and so am I about this. I guess it sounds simple to people who<br/>\n&gt; have been unschooling for years. I don&#39;t understand why I have to be so<br/>\n&gt; specific if I am unschooling. I feel like they are asking too much. I<br/>\n&gt; told them I wasn&#39;t sure yet what curriculum I would be following so they<br/>\n&gt; said they would send me a sample. I feel like I am lying to them because<br/>\n&gt; they are making me say things I don&#39;t want to say in order to be allowed<br/>\n&gt; to unschool my son. It doesn&#39;t feel good. I can only imagine what I will<br/>\n&gt; go through for my 14 year old with dyslexia in order to unschool him. I<br/>\n&gt; feel so anxious about the whole thing now.
