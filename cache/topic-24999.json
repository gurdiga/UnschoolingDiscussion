Of <br/>\ncourse virtually everything does. And even if it didn&#39;t, life will go on if <br/>\neverything is NOT educational. Maybe we obsess about that a bit too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think sometimes you get back to the respect thing: I, for example, just <br/>\nfind Teletubbies totally creepy and it makes my skin crawl. If Julian (who <br/>\nfeels strongly that I need to mention that he has never wanted to) wanted to <br/>\nwatch it when I wasn&#39;t around, I&#39;d certainly have no problem with that. But <br/>\nif I was doing something in the living room first, I&#39;d assume I had the right <br/>\nto veto that. On the other hand, if I wanted to watch something he didn&#39;t <br/>\nlike and he was there first, he&#39;d have veto power.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, this whole thing rarely comes up. I&#39;m babbling...<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24972,"nextTopicId":24718}}
