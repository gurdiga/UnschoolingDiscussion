I thought it was grime and dirt in general.  I don&#39;t immunize my<br/>\nchildren but I DO live in an area with horses freely roaming the streets. &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is from a tetanus info site:<br/>\nTetanus, also sometimes called &quot;lockjaw&quot;, is caused by a toxin produced by a<br/>\nbacteria called Clostridium tetani. C. tetani is found all over, including<br/>\nsoil (the garden and field kind), stool and manure, and anything lying on<br/>\nthe ground. Rusty metal is also a favourite place for C. tetani to hang out,<br/>\nand in fact puncture wounds with rusty nails are a common cause of tetanus.<br/>\nC. tetani grows in wounds, especially closed wounds like punctures, and<br/>\nproduces a toxin that paralyzes muscles -- thus the term &quot;lockjaw&quot;. In the<br/>\nworst case tetanus can kill by paralyzing the breathing muscles. Although C.<br/>\ntetani itself can be treated easily with penicillin, antibiotics will not<br/>\ndestroy or neutralize the toxin. Antibodies to the toxin can bind to and<br/>\ninactivate the toxin before it attacks muscles and nerves<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the vaccines derived from human cell lines, this explains it as<br/>\nwell as I&#39;ve seen it anywhere: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cogforlife.org/vaxbrochsample.htm\">http://www.cogforlife.org/vaxbrochsample.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38208,"nextTopicId":38214}}
