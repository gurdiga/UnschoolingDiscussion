(I did finally read your second example and found it easier than <br/>\nthe first.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember anything at all about my math (arithmetic) experiences <br/>\nbefore grade 4.  I think I didn&#39;t have any problems with it.  In grade 4, I <br/>\nbogged down on long division.  I probably stayed after school every day <br/>\nthat year trying to finish my work.  It just seemed to take so long with <br/>\neach problem to figure out how many times a number would &quot;go into&quot; another <br/>\none.  I&#39;d try one number, and it would be too big.  Then I&#39;d try another, <br/>\nand it would be too small, etc. etc. etc.  From that time on, I was in the <br/>\nlowest math group.  In grade 5, we didn&#39;t finish the book (by about <br/>\nhalf).  In grade 6 we finished even less (because of having to finish the <br/>\nprevious one) and then I got to grade 7, where we were tracked.  I got put <br/>\ninto the top (college bound) track because of my language arts skills.  We <br/>\nwere expected to do grade 7 and 8 math in that year and go on to algebra in <br/>\ngrade 8 instead of 9.  Remember I hadn&#39;t come close to finishing the grade <br/>\n6 book.  I got through because we had a teacher who would raise our grade a <br/>\nlittle bit for each oral report we did about math.  I did tons of them, <br/>\neven though I hated public speaking, and managed to get through.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlgebra completely stumped me, not because I couldn&#39;t get the concepts but <br/>\nbecause I took so long to do the arithmetic and got behind.  Maybe I would <br/>\nhave been ok if we could have used calculators for the arithmetic, but that <br/>\nwas before calculators.  And we weren&#39;t allowed to use slide rules, even if <br/>\nI had known how.  On to geometry after barely managing to get a C in <br/>\nalgebra.  I did great until we hit square roots . . .<br/>\nIn college, I had to take a math course and took &quot;math for liberal arts <br/>\nstudents&quot;.  It was symbolic logic, and I *loved* it.  I even took a more <br/>\nadvanced course and was told I should go into programming.  (I did but <br/>\ndidn&#39;t finish before moving to Canada.  Here, you had to have a whole pile <br/>\nof math and science to even get in, even though I had been getting straight <br/>\nAs in programming in California.)<br/>\nSo there you have my math experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I also want to hear, especially from that above group, how you handle math<br/>\n&gt;stuff with your kids -- how do you make sure you don&#39;t pass on your math<br/>\n&gt;anxiety to them?

I fear I haven&#39;t <br/>\nsucceeded well at all in that area.  My son was actually &quot;ahead&quot; of his <br/>\nschooled friends in the early years.  He managed to learn most of the <br/>\npractical arithmetic up through percentages and some fraction stuff, mostly <br/>\nthrough his interest in money.

He liked to have us<br/>\nask him math questions in the car, so I used to say what&#39;s 5 + 6 and he&#39;d<br/>\nthink a minute and answer 11, so I&#39;d say what&#39;s 8 +3 and he&#39;d think a minute<br/>\nand answer 11.  We&#39;d do several of these in a row, and what I always found<br/>\ninteresting, was that he&#39;d take the time to think it through, even though he<br/>\nsaw what I was doing - he was delighted with the idea that there was more<br/>\nthan one way to get the same answer.  We noodled around with other number<br/>\nthings too.  Multiplication for example - he&#39;d want me to make up problems<br/>\nfor him, so I&#39;d say what&#39;s 3 x 5, then I&#39;d rephrase it what are three fives.<br/>\nI find that that subtle difference in wording really helps me to actually<br/>\nSEE what it is I&#39;m supposed to be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s always had access to computer games and board games and card games and<br/>\npuzzles and real life use of money as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve never drilled him on memorizing tables or spent much time on writing<br/>\n&quot;problems&quot; down, most of this stuff is all verbal.  I find he gets concepts<br/>\nvery easily and is able to jump to the next level in stuff pretty<br/>\nintuitively.  I&#39;m just barely hanging on by my fingernails, but I think<br/>\nwe&#39;re pretty safely over the hump of me having to worry about having passed<br/>\non math phobia to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps a lot that his dad is not nearly so much a mathphob as me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also helps a LOT that we know Pam in real life, so that when he has a<br/>\nquestion about some concept that has me baffled, he can talk to her about<br/>\nit.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJocelyn Vilter</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] more negative and positives stuff","postDate":"1020798452","msgId":36829,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5Yy4xZTU1MGJhLjJhMDk3ZmY0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36827,"nextInTopic":36832,"prevInTime":36828,"nextInTime":36830,"topicId":36801,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/7/2002 11:20:04 AM Pacific Daylight Time, ...

I don&#39;t find a lot of uses for soldering iron in my life --- <br/>\nbut I have a friend who does. Why? Because he knows how to use one and, when <br/>\nsomething comes up that he wants to do, he thinks of it as part of his tool <br/>\nkit. If I am faced with the same situation, a soldering iron won&#39;t be in my <br/>\ntool kit and so I won&#39;t even see the situation as one that requires a <br/>\nsoldering iron. I&#39;ll see it as needing glue or tape or maybe as needing a <br/>\nfriend who might have more tools &lt;G&gt;. So - with negative and positive numbers <br/>\n- if you don&#39;t have a facility with them, you won&#39;t notice all the times they <br/>\ncould have been useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is the case with algebra. People often say they never got algebra and it <br/>\nnever hurt them because they never had any use for it anyway. But, I use <br/>\nalgebra frequently in my regular day-to-day life (not counting using it <br/>\nprofessionally in statistics and economics). I use it because I have a <br/>\nfacility with it and so I use it to figure things out that other people might <br/>\nhave figured out (with more difficulty, less flexibility, and more likelihood <br/>\nof error) some other way or might have just ignored or might have guessed at <br/>\nor might have taken someone else&#39;s word for.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - this isn&#39;t an argument that everybody SHOULD learn algebra or how to use <br/>\npositive and negative numbers. No more than that everyone SHOULD learn to use <br/>\na soldering iron. But it is just to explain why you don&#39;t always notice all <br/>\nthe possible &quot;uses&quot; for all these mathematical tools in your daily life.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I&#39;m also uncomfortable leaving the impression that I might think <br/>\nunderstanding math is only worthwhile because it is useful in daily life. <br/>\nReading is good for more than understanding assembly instructions, filling <br/>\nout job applications, reading traffic citations &lt;G&gt;, and other &quot;practical&quot; <br/>\napplications - it is a way to communicate and to understand the world <br/>\n(reading literature, poetry, interesting information, biographies, history, <br/>\netc.).

My <br/>\ntheorem is that bad things often happen when arithmetic computational skills <br/>\nare taught BEFORE concepts have been absorbed and integrated. A corollary is <br/>\nthat concepts can be absorbed in daily life, through fun and games, through <br/>\nconversation and argument and by observation.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Math&quot; is something.

It is a way to give some MEANING to the signs so that you <br/>\nwon&#39;t have to memorize a formula or so that, at the least, the formula will <br/>\nhave some sense behind it. I searched math books - dozens of the most popular <br/>\nof them - almost every one just gave the formula, none gave understandable <br/>\nexamples. So that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do - write up more understandable <br/>\nexamples.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is an example of the positive and negative signs having an actual meaning, <br/>\ninstead of just a formula.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;formula&quot; says: &quot;When multiplying two numbers, if the signs of the two <br/>\nnumbers are the same, the product is positive and if the signs are different, <br/>\nthe product is positive.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is just a formula - no meaning and hard to remember since there is no <br/>\n&quot;reason&quot; or &quot;explanation&quot; for it - just a rule to follow.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I&#39;ve become very aware of (and this might help some of you) is that <br/>\npeople who consider themselves &quot;nonmathies&quot; often don&#39;t really read EACH <br/>\nlittle bit of an explanation. My mom and my sisters are all very math anxious <br/>\n- when I explain something to them, they don&#39;t &quot;hear&quot; it all. Their attention <br/>\nwanders, they block bits, they are too used to the kind of reading where they <br/>\ncan skim a little and still follow the action. Whatever the reason - the fact <br/>\nis that these kinds of explanations require someone to focus on one bit at a <br/>\ntime and make sure that each bit is understood before moving on to the next. <br/>\nIt is SLOW reading, sometimes painstaking. But - the understanding you can <br/>\nget from doing it that way is very very empowering.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard, in writing, to make this clear, because I can&#39;t watch your eye <br/>\nmovement, facial expression, body language, etc., and so I can&#39;t (gently &lt;G&gt;) <br/>\nbring you back to the step where you got lost (it almost always is because of <br/>\nlack of enough attention to the step right before that one).<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] more negative and positives stuff","postDate":"1020768007","msgId":36807,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4RkQyNzQ3Ljg2QzMlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwM2EwMWMxZjU2MSQwNzQ2ZDU0MCQ2NDAwYThjMEBnb2R6aWxsYT4="},"prevInTopic":36806,"nextInTopic":36819,"prevInTime":36806,"nextInTime":36808,"topicId":36801,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But the positive and negative can represent *anything* that&#39;s<br/>\nopposite. In Pam&#39;s example, they represent opposite cardinal directions.<br/>\nThey can also represent charges on a particle, whether something is<br/>\nincreasing or decreasing, coming after or before or above or below some<br/>\nchosen point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s from being taught how to do arithmetic before we&#39;ve had lots of<br/>\nexperience with numbers that has cemented the idea that positives are<br/>\nsomething and negatives are less than nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMultiplying 2 negatives numbers is just multiplying 2 qualities that come in<br/>\nopposite flavors to their 2 positive counterparts. The positives and<br/>\nnegatives sometimes make sense like up and rising being positive and down<br/>\nand falling being negative. Sometimes they&#39;re just chosen so everyone is<br/>\nusing negative the same way. (The &quot;negative&quot; charge of an electron isn&#39;t<br/>\nreally negative. It&#39;s just opposite the &quot;positive&quot; charge of the proton.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe numbers can tell you *how big* something is. The positives and negatives<br/>\ncan tell you *where* it is in relation to some (sometimes arbitrarily<br/>\nchosen) reference (zero) point.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife came first. Then we invented math as a way to describe life. Teaching<br/>\nmath out of the context of what it&#39;s describing is like teaching a foreign<br/>\ngrammar and vocabulary without ever hearing or using the language.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath makes sense in context.

(They&#39;ll end up east of where they <br/>\nstarted.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSince there are three of them, each taking 2 steps, you&#39;ll have a total of 6 <br/>\nsteps to the east and the answer is +6.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have:  -3 X -2 = +6<br/>\n<br/>\n*********************<br/>\n(Note - i could have made the meanings of the signs be reversed - let the <br/>\nsign of the first number be walking forward or backward and the sign of the <br/>\nsecond number be which direction they are facing, east or west. It doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmatter. Sometimes, for some real-world situations, one way makes more sense. <br/>\nBut it doesn&#39;t matter here.)<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36922,"nextTopicId":36935}}
