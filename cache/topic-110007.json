So standardized tests went<br/>\n&gt; through some awkward days and some fancy experimental days, and are<br/>\n&gt; probably still constantly revised because of complaints that some<br/>\n&gt; aspect or other wasn&#39;t fair.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh well.  One student may divine the answer the test designer is<br/>\nlooking <br/>\nfor and another may not be able to see where any of the questions are <br/>\nheaded.  Questions are often not without intentions even in real life. <br/>\nIn real life you would want to avoid putting intentions onto your <br/>\nquestions.  But that&#39;s the whole point of standardized tests.  Paradox:<br/>\n<br/>\nquestion reality.. yeh but question someone&#39;s knowledge.. maybe you&#39;ll <br/>\nget all kinds of seemingly &quot;wrong&quot; answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But for unschoolers, it doesn&#39;t matter.  We can encourage kids to go<br/>\n&gt; with more creative answers.  A very badly worded question (trivia or<br/>\n&gt; real-life or standardized test) can create more mirth and learning<br/>\n&gt; than a well-worded one, if the mom&#39;s attitude about it is light and<br/>\n&gt; happy instead of dark and angry. If learning is the goal, not<br/>\n&gt; testing, then we as unschoolers should not invest negative energy in<br/>\n&gt; or around testing.  It&#39;s just a thing, like a fence or a menu, or<br/>\n&gt; like an old pair of shoes maybe we should throw away.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It would be a bother to have to test ds to meet state requirements. <br/>\nBut <br/>\nI agree.  Illogically worded questions would excite mirth as easily as <br/>\nanger, and mirth would be a good choice.  The cool thing is, in some <br/>\nstates at least -I think all of them-, it doesn&#39;t matter if kids pass<br/>\nor <br/>\nfail.  As long as the tests are completed and sent in, the school aged <br/>\nkids are all accounted for.  (I&#39;m not sure about the laws, so nobody <br/>\nquote me on that.)  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any need to invest ourselves <br/>\nin outcomes.  Otherwise, I&#39;ll be writing something like this: &quot;Dear <br/>\nSenator/ Congressperson, if you legislate that I teach to the test at <br/>\nhome, I promise you a failing grade on YOUR test by voting against<br/>\nyou.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Here&#39;s an example of a much better answer, a story Pam Sorooshian<br/>\n&gt; posted some time back:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ================<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;There are 72 students in a school and 6 classes. How many students<br/>\n&gt; are in each class?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rosie says - &quot;There could be any number from zero to 72 in a class.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The answer is 12.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ================================<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeh, 6x12=72.  But you&#39;d do better to visit the classrooms and do a <br/>\nheadcount or look at the attendance sheets because in real life you <br/>\nmight not want to assume something based on what it&#39;s handy to do in <br/>\nyour head with math.  A handier thing to know: how to deal with real<br/>\nlife.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And my favorite from my kids, when they were little, and a pre-school<br/>\n&gt; BrainQuest card showed line drawings of a table, lamp, chair and bed<br/>\n&gt; and asked which one used electricity.  It was a great moment.  The<br/>\n&gt; kids looked at me with the most wonderful little-kid looks of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;What!?&quot; and said all of them could, but none of them had to.  Sure<br/>\n&gt; enough, there are electric tables (we owned two, with outlets mounted<br/>\n&gt; in the side, and a light table), and certainly beds in hospitals use<br/>\n&gt; electricity, and our neighbor had just bought a recliner that could<br/>\n&gt; lift her up and out of it, and they&#39;d seen recliners that had heat<br/>\n&gt; and massage features.  They were also familiar with kerosene lamps,<br/>\n&gt; oil lamps and battery lamps, and the picture-question clearly showed<br/>\n&gt; an electrical outlet, I think, so batteries wouldn&#39;t have counted.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So for my kids, that was not a question with a simple &quot;right&quot; answer.<br/>\n&gt; Good for them!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely.

Cheating!<br/>\n<br/>\nA   young (former) friend of mine once said cleverly (NOT) &quot;I would say &#39;f- - <br/>\n- you,&#39; but I&#39;m not going to.&quot;    <br/>\n<br/>\nTest questions have always been frustrating, and in the early 70&#39;s there were <br/>\nattempts to make tests &quot;relevant,&quot; and so there was a test designed to be <br/>\nupdated and make more sense.   And then THOSE qustions were sent around because <br/>\nit had to do with subway schedules and elevators and stuff.   Most people in <br/>\nthe   U.S. don&#39;t live anywhere near a subway (and most of those not even near a <br/>\nbus), and many in towns with no elevators whatsoever except maybe in the <br/>\ntwo-story hospital, if they have one.    So those questions too were rejected.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the same season, though, testing itself was being studied and analyzed to <br/>\ndeath, and the way some tests were devised for a while (maybe still, but I <br/>\ndoubt it), when they started doing computer scoring, was that there were better <br/>\nanswers and worse answers.   Responses were weighted so that they could get the <br/>\nREALLY high scores (see how many best answers a person had).   So if someone <br/>\npicked that 2nd answer that seemed almost as good as the first, that could <br/>\nshow on the scoring too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for test scores to be very useful, all involved have to understand <br/>\nthem--every school counsellor, teacher and parent... and that just wasn&#39;t likely to <br/>\nhappen.   So standardized tests went through some awkward days and some fancy <br/>\nexperimental days, and are probably still constantly revised because of <br/>\ncomplaints that some aspect or other wasn&#39;t fair.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for unschoolers, it doesn&#39;t matter.   We can encourage kids to go with <br/>\nmore creative answers.   A very badly worded question (trivia or real-life or <br/>\nstandardized test) can create more mirth and learning than a well-worded one, if <br/>\nthe mom&#39;s attitude about it is light and happy instead of dark and angry.   <br/>\nIf learning is the goal, not testing, then we as unschoolers should not invest <br/>\nnegative energy in or around testing.   It&#39;s just a thing, like a fence or a <br/>\nmenu, or like an old pair of shoes maybe we should throw away.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an example of a much better answer, a story Pam Sorooshian posted some <br/>\ntime back:<br/>\n<br/>\n================<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There are 72 students in a school and 6 classes. How many students are <br/>\nin each class?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRosie says - &quot;There could be any number from zero to 72 in a class.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer is 12.<br/>\n<br/>\n================================<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my favorite from my kids, when they were little, and a pre-school <br/>\nBrainQuest card showed line drawings of a table, lamp, chair and bed and asked which <br/>\none used electricity.    It was a great moment.   The kids looked at me with <br/>\nthe most wonderful little-kid looks of &quot;What!?&quot; and said all of them could, but <br/>\nnone of them had to.    Sure enough, there are electric tables (we owned two, <br/>\nwith outlets mounted in the side, and a light table), and certainly beds in <br/>\nhospitals use electricity, and our neighbor had just bought a recliner that <br/>\ncould lift her up and out of it, and they&#39;d seen recliners that had heat and <br/>\nmassage features.    They were also familiar with kerosene lamps, oil lamps and <br/>\nbattery lamps, and the picture-question clearly showed an electrical outlet, I <br/>\nthink, so batteries wouldn&#39;t have counted.    <br/>\n<br/>\nSo for my kids, that was not a question with a simple &quot;right&quot; answer.   Good <br/>\nfor them!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110651,"nextTopicId":110401}}
