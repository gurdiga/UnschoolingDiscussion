My older son however has seen things, such as Star Wars or 9/11 and is able to process the information in a different way. He talks through a lot of things. He to this day still talks about the fire we had over a year ago, they are just different. For us, it would have felt wrong to not let him know the truth (instead of him just seeing that his mommy was upset and not knowing why).<br/>\n<br/>\nKaraGet more from the Web.

DO YOU THINK unguided tv <br/>\nwatching goes into the subconscious and lowers the bar on moral beahvior?? I <br/>\nfind myslef accepting things i see on t v every day  a little more each <br/>\nyear...not happily i might add!!!!! I have had the kids i adopted since 5 <br/>\nweeks or 3 weeks old...but thier birth mothers were in at least 2 of their <br/>\nlives for 4 years!!!! LOTS OF DAMAGE And fear still reigns....at night esp. <br/>\nStrong independent thinkers come from kids who have never felt liek the <br/>\nbottom dropped out of thier lives. Imagine being taken away from your <br/>\nsecurity....even if its scary you dont know it s scary til you learn new ways <br/>\nof life@ foster home!!!!!!!! SO&gt;........i am lucky and feel blessed that mine <br/>\nare doing so well....there are many others who are not or cannot. I guess <br/>\nadoption is another whole issue.....but in general! I ASK OF YOU!!!!! do you <br/>\nthink tv watching and seeing killing and even the WTC over and over lowers <br/>\nour threshold?? I got very tired and sickened by seeing it over and over. as <br/>\ndid my kids. but ........its not so horrifying the 50th time....no question <br/>\nabout that.... i DO think tv is an issue....but i truly dont know if im <br/>\ndamaging my kids by letting them watch whatever they want.... they do <br/>\neventually turn off stuff.....or find better activities......Im asking for <br/>\nopinions......P&gt;S&gt; ALL YOU WHO ARUGE ABOUT UNSCHOOLING???? read Linda <br/>\nDobson&#39;s book:  Homeschoolers Success Stories and quit worrying! JUST DO <br/>\nIT!!!!!!!! everyone is different...and no one has the right to define for <br/>\nanyone else or judge!!!!! LET IT GO LET IT GO !SERENITY NOWWWWWWW as KRamer <br/>\nsays on Seinfeld!
