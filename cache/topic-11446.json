The more we can learn about<br/>\nwhere you&#39;re from, your city, region, and country, the better.  That sort of<br/>\ninformation is what I personally hope to glean from this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I realize I&#39;m discriminating against non-native English speakers, I<br/>\nhave no choice but to make English the language used in this forum.  Please<br/>\nforgive me for that.  We welcome all, even those of you who feel inadequate<br/>\nwhen it comes to writing messages in English.  We promise to be considerate,<br/>\nand patient.  Perhaps your efforts will motivate some of us native speakers<br/>\nof English to learn another language ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegular participation in this forum should reward us with a broader<br/>\nperspective of the homeschooling movement, a deeper sense of connectedness<br/>\nwith people from around the world, and perhaps a few new friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo spam.  No chain letters.  No discussion of politics or religion.<br/>\nOpen-mindedness, respect of other&#39;s beliefs and customs, and a listening ear<br/>\nare all mandatory.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy goal is to create a fun and supportive group with a lot of interesting<br/>\npeople.  If you would like to see that as well, you&#39;ve come to the right<br/>\nplace.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Andersen<br/>\n&quot;Unconventional Ideas&quot; at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://unconventional.go.to\">http://unconventional.go.to</a><br/>\nWant to live more deliberately?
