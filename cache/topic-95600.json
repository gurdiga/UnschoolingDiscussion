Just another option!  I<br/>\njust loved using it for my last baby. I wore him quite a bit and it always<br/>\ncalmed him.  It was light, and I could move him around to the back when he<br/>\nwas asleep, which was really great for being able to have arms free for my<br/>\nother children or for doing dishes/cooking, etc... Plus, it was even more<br/>\ncomfortable wearing him on my back. I&#39;ve been using the Ergo Baby Carrier<br/>\nsince Evan was able to sit up on his own and he started to<br/>\ndislike being so wrapped up, so I don&#39;t really need the sling anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor reviews of the New Native Sling read here<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.epinions.com/kifm-Baby_Equipment-Carriers-All-New_Native_Baby_Carrier\">http://www.epinions.com/kifm-Baby_Equipment-Carriers-All-New_Native_Baby_Carrier</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo see the New Native Sling being worn and read other reviews, look here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://store.naturalbambinos.com/sling-nn-conv.html\">http://store.naturalbambinos.com/sling-nn-conv.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~Andrea</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95401,"nextTopicId":95412}}
