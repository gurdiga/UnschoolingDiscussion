I am new to the list and new to the idea of unschooling.  My<br/>\nson is just 2-1/2 and my husb. and I just recently realized that<br/>\nunschooling is what we want for his &quot;education.&quot;  It was such a<br/>\n&quot;lightbulb moment&quot; (as Oprah would say!) when I realized what this would<br/>\n<br/>\nmean for our son, our home life, our careers, and it just feels so<br/>\nright.  I was never interested in homeschooling, i.e. following a school<br/>\n<br/>\ncurriculum at home, but when I started thinking about unschooling I<br/>\nrealized that was really the alternative to education that I was looking<br/>\n<br/>\nfor, but unable to articulate.  Thank goodness for the internet and for<br/>\nall the wonderful resources and communities to help us think about<br/>\nparenting in the 21st century!!  (I just had to stick that in there.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I know about Gatto (sp?) and Holt, but I was thinking of<br/>\nordering Linda Dobson&#39;s _Art of Education_ because it sounded<br/>\ninteresting - the subtitle is something like Reclaiming your Child, your<br/>\n<br/>\nCommunity, your Self??  Does anyone have insights about this book?  Do<br/>\nyou recommend it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any feedback,<br/>\nTiff</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7261,"nextTopicId":7262}}
