I certainly agreed with your<br/>\nassumptions about math when I first started reading about unschooling.  I,<br/>\ntoo, was a victim of contextless, rote-learned math.  It really seemed the<br/>\nonly way.  There were specific ways to do addition, multiplication,<br/>\ndivision, and on up the math scale that just had to be explained step by<br/>\nstep and sat down and practiced ad nauseum.  And what child was going to put<br/>\nin all those necessary hours on her own?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took me several years of reading what other unschoolers had to say but it<br/>\nreally wasn&#39;t until I saw my daughter actually manipulating numbers without<br/>\nbeing specifically shown how that I understood how unschooling could work<br/>\nwith math.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with school math, and as far as I&#39;ve seen all math curriculums,<br/>\nis they start kids off immediately with the abstract.  A child may be able<br/>\nto see they have one brother and one sister and therefore have two siblings,<br/>\nor one gray cat and one yellow cat to make two cats, but put 1+1 on paper it<br/>\nbecomes incredibly abstract.  Why would anyone want to add 73+48?  The<br/>\nprocess is meaningless.  The answer is meaningless.  It has no context.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany math programs do have kids adding sorting bears or manipulating rods or<br/>\nany number of other hands-on things, but they&#39;re still basically<br/>\nmeaningless.  The teacher has created the problem and dumped it on the<br/>\nchild.  Why does anyone want to know how many blue bears there are?  Why are<br/>\nthe red and blue bears being added together?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, on the other hand, my daughter is quite intrigued to find out how many<br/>\nJurassic dinos she has versus Triassic.  How many plant eaters versus meat<br/>\neaters.  (And whatever other classifications she can come up with, limited<br/>\nonly by her imagination -- versus the 2 or 3 categories of the sorting<br/>\nbears.) How many years separated the various ages of the dinos.  The heights<br/>\nand weights of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd though counting and graphing M&M&#39;s by number and color seems the same as<br/>\ndoing these same things with the counting bears, it&#39;s not.  She&#39;s gaining<br/>\ninformation in the form of patterns and relationships (that are often<br/>\nexpressed as numbers) about her own world, things *she* cares about.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously there&#39;s only so far counting will get you in life ;-) but we<br/>\nmanipulate all sorts of numbers in her life and I make sure she&#39;s immersed<br/>\nin patterns and relationships between various things in her life for her to<br/>\nexamine (or not).  Like fractions in cooking and time: &quot;Since the cup is<br/>\ndirty, how can I make 1 1/2 cups?&quot;  &quot;The recipe calls for 1 Tablespoon but<br/>\nwe&#39;re cutting it in half.  And a Tablespoon is 3 teaspoons.  So what would<br/>\nthat be?&quot;  &quot;It&#39;s an hour and a half or 3 Bill Nyes until Daddy comes home.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s 20 minutes or a third of an hour until Xena comes on.&quot;  Though<br/>\nlearning to take 1/3 of 60 is more universally applicable, she can *feel*<br/>\nthe 20 minutes wait out of 60 minutes and she can get the feel that<br/>\nfractions are ways of relating one thing to another.  Decimals come up with<br/>\nmoney.  Percentages come up with sales, tax, food labels, possibility of<br/>\nwinning a contest, shrinking an image in a paint program.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s gaining a feel for the contexts the various concepts are used in, she<br/>\nsees me manipulating them and helping her manipulate them.  And in the<br/>\ncourse she&#39;s adding pieces to the puzzle of her world, making new patterns<br/>\nand relationships clearer.<br/>\n<br/>\nUp until recently we&#39;ve done zero in the way of formal math.  Only a few<br/>\nmonths ago she wasn&#39;t totally consistent on her addition but I asked her if<br/>\nshe knew what 8x5 was.  She said that was 16 +16 + 8.  *Not* 8+8+8+8+8,<br/>\nwhich would have been a good answer showing she understood the concept of<br/>\nmultiplication, but she manipulated the numbers properly into something she<br/>\ncould feel more intuitively.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently she has been doing paper and pencil math under protest.  Sort of.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe wants to earn money for Pokemon cards.  I buy the packs at any where<br/>\nfrom $4-$6 a piece, pull out the trainer cards and then calculate how much<br/>\nshe needs to pay for each Pokemon card.  (Or have her do it for a whole<br/>\ncard, though that&#39;s still a bit beyond her true understanding even if she<br/>\ndoes get the answer right.)  I suggested all sorts of household tasks for<br/>\nher to earn 25 cents or a dollar or whatever which were met with groans.<br/>\n(She even turned down *$2* to clean out the floor of my car!  ;-)  I<br/>\nsuggested she do pages in the Miquon math workbooks that have been gathering<br/>\ndust on the shelf at 10 cents per page.  Being a low energy child (like her<br/>\nmother ;-) she usually opts for the math.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s getting *much* better at the pages, but I can still see a huge<br/>\ndifference between what she does on paper versus what she does with the real<br/>\nmeaningful numbers in her life.  She quickly calculates in her head how much<br/>\nshe&#39;s earned and how much she needs and how much she&#39;ll have left over after<br/>\nbuying a card, tells me how many 36 cent cards she can get with her $2<br/>\nallowance versus how many 41 cent ones.  (And she does this without drills<br/>\nand without pages of workbook practice, just from messing around with the<br/>\nnumbers in her life in a very low key way -- the stuff she&#39;s doing in the<br/>\nworkbooks is actually much simpler.)  She told me the way she figured out<br/>\n16+16 was it was just 10+10 then 6+6 which is 12 which is 10+2, so that was<br/>\n10+10+10+2 or 32.  She&#39;s discovering for herself how to break numbers apart<br/>\nand play around with them.  And she *knows* why someone would want to do<br/>\nthat.  If it were taught in a book, it would take weeks and most kids would<br/>\nstill be baffled about what the purpose of it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nPencil and paper math and head math *are* different.  The pencil and paper<br/>\nmath are a new language she&#39;s learning.  And yet, I&#39;m quite confident if we<br/>\nhad gone on without much pencil and paper stuff (other than the normal<br/>\nthings that come up in life) she would have caught onto it *way* quicker in<br/>\na couple of years without the agony she was putting herself through.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s obviously a far way from algebra and trig and calc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone pointed out that algebra is just figuring out what you don&#39;t know<br/>\nfrom what you do know.  Now how did I get all the way through engineering<br/>\nschool without realizing that insight?  Maybe because I enjoyed identifying<br/>\nthe problem types and figuring out which methodology to apply to them.  It<br/>\ndidn&#39;t make any difference whether I truly understood why I was doing what I<br/>\nwas doing.  The fun was it worked.  Because that&#39;s how algebra is taught.<br/>\nIt&#39;s all about practicing manipulating different types of equations.  It&#39;s<br/>\nnot about what those equations mean.  Or why anyone would want to write a<br/>\nquadratic equation let alone solve it.  It&#39;s all just preparation for<br/>\npotential contexts.  But the equations themselves have no context.  They&#39;re<br/>\nmeaningless.   (Unless you&#39;re one of the &quot;good&quot; ones who rise to the surface<br/>\nthrough this bizarre math-teaching process just because you happen to like<br/>\nto manipulate equations for the sake of manipulating equations.)<br/>\n<br/>\nQuadratic equations don&#39;t come up in real life often, but I can help my<br/>\ndaughter to think algebraically when we tackle real life problems.  (I may<br/>\nbe doing it already unconsciously, but you&#39;ll have to wait a few years for<br/>\nme to be conscious enough of it to provide real life examples of her using<br/>\nit.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course that isn&#39;t enough to get her into CMU.  Or into MIT either ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, given the choice, I&#39;m quite certain I wouldn&#39;t have gotten in enough<br/>\nmath on my own to get into CMU.  So what makes me certain my daughter will?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I&#39;m *not* certain, but what leads me to believe that my daughter&#39;s<br/>\noutlook will be different is, for one thing, I was the victim of force-fed<br/>\nlearning.  I needed to be force fed math because I&#39;d always been force fed<br/>\nlearning.  I needed to be force fed school math because it had no<br/>\nrelationship to my own world.  I didn&#39;t *need* it.  I can&#39;t imagine learning<br/>\nwhat I learned on my own because the only thing I have to base my imaginings<br/>\non are the process I went through.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I *can* imagine, though, is being so intrigued by something that the<br/>\nmath gets learned because it makes what I&#39;m interested in make sense.  I<br/>\n*can* imagine forcing myself to learn something in order to achieve<br/>\nsomething else.  (HTML comes to mind ;-)  Though that was more a combination<br/>\nof both of them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat my daughter has going for her is a different experience with math.<br/>\nOther than the workbook pages :-P, she&#39;s used to seeing math as a tool.<br/>\nShe&#39;s used to using math because she wants the information it can give her.<br/>\nSo when she gets to high school, she won&#39;t have the memory of 8 previous<br/>\nyears of drudgework associated with math.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;ll also have a better foundation of understanding what she&#39;s doing.<br/>\nThough she might be behind her PS counterparts in calculation speed, she&#39;ll<br/>\nbe ahead in understanding what the processes mean.  (But the speed will<br/>\ndepend on her.  If she feels working around gaps in her multiplication<br/>\ntables is more annoying than learning the tables -- and if she knows that<br/>\ndrilling them or doing other things will help her (and it&#39;s my job to help<br/>\nher learn to identify when a problem exists and to seek out solutions) --<br/>\nthen she&#39;ll learn them.  If not, she won&#39;t.  (*I* still have gaps in my<br/>\ntables.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo she&#39;ll hit her high school years with a different attitude towards math<br/>\nand learning math.  (And this really applies to *all* subjects.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut will she be able to pick up all the math she needs to get into college<br/>\njust by living?  Well, yes and no.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where it gets hard to explain because our thinking is based on<br/>\noodles more assumptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s so easy to project a schooled teen (which includes most of us) as a<br/>\nnormal teen and assume all kids given the chance will watch TV and eat<br/>\nconcoctions centering on sugar, fat and salt all day and want nothing more<br/>\nin life than 256 channels and a clicker in the hand ;-)  That behavior is<br/>\ncaused by the stress of school (and a lot of other factors.  I have another<br/>\nrant about being forced to spend 12 years working towards a vague goal that<br/>\nsomeone else has chosen for you. ;-)  But in an environment where the adults<br/>\nand everyone else in the family are curious about life, where everyone&#39;s<br/>\ninterests are taken seriously (even the so-called non-educational ones), the<br/>\nkids are actively curious too.  There&#39;s no reason for them to want to shut<br/>\ntheir brains down as a life&#39;s goal.  (Which doesn&#39;t mean my daughter doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwatch TV.  At times she even watches a lot of TV.  But she chooses it for<br/>\nother reason than shutting off the world.  (Though that&#39;s a legitimate use<br/>\ntoo.  It&#39;s just that she doesn&#39;t have to spend a goodly portion of her free<br/>\ntime recovering from 6 hours of force fed learning in a high-stress<br/>\nenvironment everyday.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHad unschooling been thrust upon me as a teen, I imagine I would have spent<br/>\nas much time as possible doing nothing.  It&#39;s hard to imagine a teen<br/>\nlearning on their own something that we ourselves would avoid.  It seems<br/>\nobvious that given the choice most teens would avoid Shakespeare or American<br/>\nHistory or Algebra or whatever school made us hate because we know *we&#39;d*<br/>\navoid it.  But, given a choice, would we have avoided it because it&#39;s<br/>\ninherently dull or because school made it dull?  It isn&#39;t fair to assume the<br/>\nbehavior of a schooled teen is normal behavior.  The only experience<br/>\nschooled kids have had with most subjects is dull textbooks.  The life has<br/>\nbeen sucked out of all subjects for them.  Why *would* they pursue them on<br/>\ntheir own?  Especially if they assume the only way to learn them in a<br/>\nworthwhile way is the way schools teach them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no reason for my daughter to avoid learning because she&#39;s never been<br/>\nforced to do it.  To her learning is something you do to find out more about<br/>\nwhat you&#39;re interested in and to become better at it.  It&#39;s not something<br/>\nsomeone makes you do because they tell you you need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe *will* avoid learning in ways that aren&#39;t natural for her or don&#39;t suit<br/>\nher needs.  Some kids like workbooks.  That doesn&#39;t make them better<br/>\nlearners than those kids who don&#39;t.  It just means they learn differently.<br/>\nShe *will* avoid learning anything that isn&#39;t relevant to what she wants to<br/>\ndo or is interested in.  Which makes parents nervous for two reasons:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) What if she never gets interested?  It&#39;s possible she won&#39;t on her own.<br/>\nBut it&#39;s my job/pleasure to run as much of the world in front of her as<br/>\npossible.  The broader her experiences, the more likely something will<br/>\nconnect to something else in her life and be relevant.  (Though I can&#39;t<br/>\ndepend on when.)  Everything is connected to everything else. And everything<br/>\nrelevant is inherently interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n*But* it&#39;s also possible she won&#39;t get interested in something &quot;important&quot;.<br/>\nMath?  Writing?  Chemistry?  If she has absolutely no interest in it, then<br/>\nit&#39;s unlikely she&#39;ll be drawn to a profession that needs it to an extent<br/>\ngreater than she can pick up by living.  Though she won&#39;t leave the house<br/>\nwithout being able to figure out sales tax or write a letter to a friend or<br/>\nknow that baking powder is important in cookies because she&#39;ll have used<br/>\nthose.  She&#39;ll have enough to get by.  But it&#39;s possible she&#39;ll need higher<br/>\nmath than she has.  Or better writing skills.  Or an entire chemistry<br/>\ncourse.  Well, if it&#39;s just chemistry standing in her way, wouldn&#39;t it make<br/>\nsense for her to go down to the community college and take it rather than<br/>\ndeciding on a different career just because of one course?  And if that&#39;s<br/>\ntoo much trouble, how much did she want that career anyway?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut math and writing?  Well, I hope something I&#39;m saying here helps you see<br/>\nwhy I believe there&#39;s a middle ground between &quot;no math&quot; and 4 years of high<br/>\nschool math from textbooks.  And writing I talk about below.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) And the second reason it makes parents nervous is supposedly there are<br/>\nthings kids need to learn that they won&#39;t need until college.  And<br/>\nsupposedly it takes 12 years to learn them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut does it?  Does it take 12 years to learn math?  Or does it take 12 years<br/>\nfor *schools* to force feed a child math (and writing and history, et al) by<br/>\nthe methods they need to use to force feed 30 kids at a time?  Methods which<br/>\nare also limited to ways that can result in outcomes that can be tested to<br/>\ndemonstrate progress.  Also limited only to methods that must be progressive<br/>\nalong a specific track so the next year&#39;s teacher can pick up where the<br/>\nprevious teacher left off.  Does *math* need taught that way?  Or do schools<br/>\nneed to teach it that way to satisfy the needs of schools as assembly lines?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a way, school math is rather like learning to spell thousands of words<br/>\nand decline hundreds of verbs of a foreign language without hearing that<br/>\nforeign language spoken.  The rationale being that once all the parts are<br/>\nlearned, the whole can be built from that.  But how many kids survive the<br/>\nrote process?  How many kids conclude not before long that the language is<br/>\nuseless because the parts have no meaning?  My daughter is hearing the<br/>\nlanguage and using it, without formally declining the verbs and learning the<br/>\nspellings.  Even if she&#39;d never been exposed to reading it (but already had<br/>\nthe decoding skills from reading English) how long would it take her to<br/>\nlearn to read that foreign language after having learned it from using it?<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce my daughter has a thorough understanding of what it means to do<br/>\ndivision, she won&#39;t need umpty gajillion problems to practice.  Once she has<br/>\na thorough understanding of problems with a range of potential solutions<br/>\n(programming and robotics come right to mind), and has encountered and<br/>\nunderstood powers and negative numbers she won&#39;t need years of practice to<br/>\ngrasp algebra.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy job is to make sure there are reasons in my daughter&#39;s environment to<br/>\nneed the skills and see them being used.  (Just as I talked to her well<br/>\nbefore she could talk.)  Though she finds a lot of uses for the skills on<br/>\nher own, given the freedom to do so.  There&#39;s no reason for her to avoid<br/>\nwriting or reading or math (until the workbooks) on her own because she&#39;s<br/>\nnever been forced to do them.  The hard part is waiting for *her* timescale.<br/>\nI need to wait until these things are internally important to her.  I can&#39;t<br/>\nworry, well, she&#39;s 8 now and should be doing ... because natural learning<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have anything to do with calendars and time schedules.  It has to do<br/>\nwith needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she has a goal in mind, she won&#39;t have anything except natural barriers<br/>\nbetween her and it.  She won&#39;t have what someone thinks she needs to get<br/>\nthere and someone else&#39;s *way* she needs to get it standing in her way.  If<br/>\nshe decides to become a vet, she&#39;ll know what colleges require for her to<br/>\nget there.  *If* her desire is strong enough, she&#39;ll learn what she needs to<br/>\nlearn because she wants what the learning can get for her.  (Desire is an<br/>\nincredible motivator.)  *And* most importantly she&#39;ll have better resources<br/>\nto achieve it than sitting down with a textbook and slogging through it.<br/>\n(Though that&#39;s an option too.  Fortunately she won&#39;t have the history of<br/>\nslogging through textbooks putting up a psychological barrier for her.)<br/>\nShe&#39;ll have a good foundation of *understanding* math concepts and will see<br/>\nit and other math being used (and use it herself) as she explores what it<br/>\ntakes to be a vet: taking care of animals, working in a vet office or a<br/>\nhorse stable.<br/>\n<br/>\n**&#92;blue{So, if your kids aren&#39;t prepared enough to go to a university, then<br/>\nyou assume that they will be motivated to study once they get rejected?}**<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer to this one is probably obvious from the above.  No, I don&#39;t<br/>\nexpect rejection to spur her.  I expect wanting to do something will spur<br/>\nher to do something.  And perhaps that something won&#39;t even be college.  I<br/>\ntoo had visions of my daughter going onto CMU or MIT.  But now my vision has<br/>\nshifted from preparing her to be anything she wants to be to helping her be<br/>\nthe best her she can be.  Yet I&#39;m not sitting around waiting to pounce on<br/>\nher interests to nurture them.  I&#39;m also directing things through her world<br/>\nthat I think are important or I think will interest her.  When (if ever) she<br/>\npicks up on them is up to her.  The more important I think something is, the<br/>\nmore likely I&#39;ll keep directing it in her path in a way that will interest<br/>\nher, or connect it to something she is interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\n**&#92;blue{ We do provide a very stimulating environment.  We have books and<br/>\nmaterials everywhere.  Lots of interesting folks float in and out of our<br/>\nhome and office.  While my 9 yo son likes to read and mess around with the<br/>\ncomputer, he wouldn&#39;t ever just open up a math book.}**<br/>\n<br/>\nNor would most kids.  For a child to choose the more formal learning in a<br/>\nbook requires an interest and need that the book can fulfill.  The<br/>\nenvironment may be there, but he&#39;s not ready to ask the questions that the<br/>\nbooks will answer for him.  Or he may be discovering the answers on his own<br/>\nthrough self-discovery or talking to people.  Unfortunately for nervous<br/>\nparents, you can&#39;t put unschooling on a time schedule.  You can&#39;t set up the<br/>\nenvironment and expect there to be a specific outcome at a specific time.<br/>\n(Though I can just about guarantee that if the innate talent or desire is in<br/>\nhim for what the computers and people and books can provide, by the time<br/>\nhe&#39;s 14 he&#39;ll have sucked the environment for all it&#39;s worth ;-)  9 is way<br/>\ntoo soon for most kids to be doing more than playing around with things and<br/>\nexploring broadly.  They may be delving deeply into some things, but the<br/>\ncognitive development necessary to make them open a math book for<br/>\ninformation just isn&#39;t there until the teen years.  (Of course there&#39;re<br/>\nalways exceptions.  But do the exceptions mean that the nonexceptions are<br/>\nfalling behind?  Or are the nonexceptions just learning other perhaps less<br/>\nobvious things?  A HS&#39;d friend of my daughter&#39;s has *at 8* read all the<br/>\nLittle House books and all their sequels and is well into other historical<br/>\nnovels.  Am I jealous?  Well, yeah, of course ;-)  Yet my daughter is, less<br/>\nobviously, picking up bits and pieces of world and American history.  She&#39;s<br/>\ngaining a broad overview of it all, expanding some bits here and there as<br/>\nshe finds out more about someone or something she&#39;s heard interesting things<br/>\nabout.  Is one learner better than the other or are they just different?)<br/>\n<br/>\n**&#92;blue{My son also wouldn&#39;t write anything on paper, which I understand is<br/>\nfairly typical for boys.  Writing skills don&#39;t progress overnight.}**<br/>\n<br/>\nWho says?  Okay, not overnight, but does it take *years* of practice?  Or<br/>\ndoes it take years of *using* the skills in ways that are meaningful for the<br/>\nlearner?  <br/>\n<br/>\n**&#92;blue{Are you saying that I should encourage, but not demand?  I am still<br/>\nmissing something in terms of how this unschooling plays out.}**<br/>\n<br/>\nHow well would you learn Hindi if someone decided it would be important for<br/>\nyour future because they used Hindi in their lives and so made you practice<br/>\nfor the next 10 years?  Wouldn&#39;t your goal be to learn as little as possible<br/>\nto satisfy them?  But if you were moving to India, then wouldn&#39;t learning<br/>\nHindi take *way* less time?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat your son needs is being immersed in an environment where it&#39;s important<br/>\nto communicate his ideas.  He also needs to see others using communication<br/>\nin a meaningful way and to read and hear others communicating in various<br/>\nways.  When *he* needs to communicate using the written word, he will.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, you can make sure he has access to the skills.  Listen to a<br/>\nvariety of things: conversation, books and books on tape, comic books,<br/>\nmovies (reading the scripts of favorites is really cool), plays, puppet<br/>\nshows, poetry, folk tales, nonfiction, cereal boxes, TV Guide, political<br/>\ntalk shows, lyrics, ministers, magazine articles, Nintendo magazine, science<br/>\nshows, letters to the editor.  *Anything* as long as he&#39;s interested.  He<br/>\nneeds to hear good (and bad) literature so his ear can learn the rhythms of<br/>\nlanguage.  I&#39;ve pointed out to my daughter why it&#39;s tough for me to read the<br/>\nMagic Tree House books outloud to her and she can now pick up on parts that<br/>\nsound awkward.  (It wasn&#39;t a lesson, just an outgrowth of a natural<br/>\ndiscussion.  Which is probably the heart of unschooling: just talking<br/>\nnaturally about things that happen along.  Despite the fact that I&#39;m not a<br/>\ngreat talker, some amazing things have come up in conversation.)  It has<br/>\nprobably inadvertently sowed the seed of her being more conscious of there<br/>\nbeing a range of how well written things are.  She would have learned that<br/>\nanyway though perhaps unconsciously.<br/>\n<br/>\n(That &quot;happen along&quot; part of unschooling is misleading.  It&#39;s not that I&#39;m<br/>\nleaving things to chance, nor am I deliberately bringing something in as a<br/>\nlesson.  I direct a lot of things her way and just from experience know that<br/>\nfrom the wealth of things, there will be unexpected learning.  Nothing I can<br/>\nplan though.  She learned more than anyone would imagine from a few weeks<br/>\nwatching Gilligan&#39;s Island.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting is just talking on paper.  You&#39;re trying to see where someone<br/>\nmentally is relative to where you intend your words to take them and then<br/>\nyou plan out a course to get them there.  Talk to your son.  Ask him to<br/>\nexplain what he&#39;s doing and ask questions to help him learn to order his<br/>\nthoughts and learn to see from the point of view of who he&#39;s communicating<br/>\nwith rather than from his own position.  (But only ask if you&#39;re interested.<br/>\nKids have good radar for lessons masked as conversation ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless someone has gotten the idea that writing is hard by being forced to<br/>\nwrite before they are ready or need to, or being forced to write in ways<br/>\nthat aren&#39;t natural to them, once they realize it&#39;s just talking on paper,<br/>\nthat little extra step is hardly any step at all.  There&#39;s additional skills<br/>\nthey can learn, like how to organize their thoughts for something longer,<br/>\nbut it&#39;s not a skill that needs 12 years of practice.  (A schooled friend of<br/>\nmy daughter&#39;s came over to play with my daughter and they decided to make<br/>\nbooks together.  The schooled girl told her there were all these things you<br/>\nhad to do: title page, a plan, and some other things.  My daughter said<br/>\n&quot;Oh,&quot; and just made books.  The schooled girl never did finish.  Merely an<br/>\nanecdote that may mean nothing, but it is a piece of data.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it only takes years to learn to write when people are forced to<br/>\nwrite things they don&#39;t care about.  Where does most writing practice end<br/>\nup?  In the trash, right?  Real writing should make a difference in people&#39;s<br/>\nlives.  Sure there&#39;s project reports and documentation to write, but do we<br/>\nneed to force kids to write boring stuff so they&#39;ll be prepared to write<br/>\nboring stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh school is when it&#39;s more common for kids to feel the need to put words<br/>\non paper.  But, again, they need real reasons.  Perhaps letters of complaint<br/>\nabout a product, letters to the editor, a family newsletter, a pen pal,<br/>\nemail, message boards, an article for the local paper, or one of the<br/>\nwebsites out there that kids can submit their writing to.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut many of these things can be &quot;laying around&quot; for him right now, suggested<br/>\nwhen it&#39;s possible he&#39;d be interested.  And dropped when he&#39;s not or carried<br/>\nas far as his interest carries him.  As long as he sees writing as<br/>\npurposeful, then there won&#39;t be anything other than natural barriers between<br/>\nhim and putting words to paper.<br/>\n<br/>\n**&#92;blue{Studies I have read show that certain windows open for certain math<br/>\nconcepts at specific times.  There seems to be accumulating evidence for a<br/>\ncertain scope and sequence for math too.  I am talking primarily about<br/>\ngetting skills so you can do higher level math.}**<br/>\n<br/>\nThe studies, of course, are based on kids whose basically only exposure to<br/>\nmath is in school.  Math to them is artificial, irrelevant to their own<br/>\nworld.  How many parents are helping their kids use the math that&#39;s all<br/>\naround them?  Math, to most kids (and adults!) is just the stuff in math<br/>\nbooks.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, my daughter *is* being exposed to math right now, using it in ways that<br/>\nare meaningful to her.  She&#39;s using the skills she needs right now.  I&#39;m not<br/>\nsitting around waiting for her to pick up a math text.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, there probably is a window of opportunity for math knowledge.  But<br/>\nthere&#39;s no way to miss it if a child&#39;s curiosity is being fed and she is<br/>\nimmersed in the language of math.  There&#39;s a window for learning to speak<br/>\ntoo, but the only way to miss that is by not speaking to the child.  As long<br/>\nas we speak math to our kids, they&#39;ll learn the parts they are<br/>\ndevelopmentally ready for.<br/>\n<br/>\n**&#92;blue{What if she chooses no math?  How do you handle that?}**<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously she hasn&#39;t yet.  It is possible she&#39;ll decide to be a painter and<br/>\nwon&#39;t need math beyond consumer math and what&#39;s relevant to the science of<br/>\ncolor.  But she&#39;ll have been exposed to fun stuff like Fibonacci numbers and<br/>\nprobabilities and algebraic thought.  But, honestly, how many people need<br/>\nalgebra?  Why torment a child with &quot;what if&quot; when it&#39;s more likely to cause<br/>\nthem to dislike the subject than to learn it?<br/>\n<br/>\n**&#92;blue{If I tell my wife that I want to try this unschooling approach<br/>\nstarting tomorrow, then what we would do at 8 AM?}**<br/>\n<br/>\nSleep?  Eat?  Watch TV?  Go outside and enjoy the sun shining through the<br/>\ntrees?  Read a book?<br/>\n<br/>\n**&#92;blue{Would my son choose when he gets up?}**<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless he stops breathing, he&#39;s always weighing his options and making<br/>\nchoices.  They may not be the choices *you&#39;d* want him to make.  But, what<br/>\nif you knew your wife had an agenda for you and there were &quot;right&quot; choices<br/>\nin her eyes and &quot;wrong&quot; choices and you knew she was weighing the choices<br/>\nyou were making against her idea of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; and judging the<br/>\nquality of your choices?  How would that affect your relationship?  I assume<br/>\nthere are some things you each do to please the other, but they are *still*<br/>\nchoices.  The more pressure someone feels from the other to make the choices<br/>\nthe other wants them to make, the more strain there is in the relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n**&#92;blue{Would he choose what he wants to learn?  Should we let him mess with<br/>\nthe Star Wars games on the computer all day?

If he&#39;s interested, he&#39;s learning.  It may be hard to see how what<br/>\nhe&#39;s learning relates to what is &quot;important&quot; in life.  In fact, it may only<br/>\nbe relevant to his life right now.  But it *is* relevant.  It&#39;s nurturing<br/>\nthe person he is now.  I think we concentrate too much on moving kids along<br/>\nto what they should become and preparing them for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n**&#92;blue{What if he says he never wants to do writing ever?}**<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, what if?  There&#39;s *plenty* of professions where people don&#39;t need to<br/>\nwrite.

Wouldn&#39;t that mean when all kids hit 12 months we should *make* them<br/>\nwalk because that&#39;s when kids need to walk, and we all know how important<br/>\nwalking is so they should get started when we think it&#39;s important?  Unless<br/>\nthere&#39;s something physically wrong with them, or their environment<br/>\ndiscourages it, all kids do eventually learn to walk just because they feel<br/>\nthe need to.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone made me write an essay on math and kids, it would be as short as<br/>\npossible to make them go away.

My opinion only.}**<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I do have the advantage of seeing the same math being learned naturally<br/>\n*way* easier than it&#39;s being taught and learned in school.  I have the<br/>\nadvantage of reading other people&#39;s kids&#39; experiences with unschooling math.<br/>\n(Helen Hegener has a good story about her son and trigonometry as I recall.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for science, ah, I have a rant about that too ;-)  The short version is,<br/>\nI think way too much emphasis is placed on memorizing the answers to<br/>\nquestions kids haven&#39;t asked and way too little time on fostering scientific<br/>\nthinking and fostering a wonder about how the universe works.

Unschooling isn&#39;t so much in what unschoolers do<br/>\nas in their attitude towards life and learning and how they&#39;re intertwined.<br/>\nOur conversations are our lessons without being lessons.  Everytime my<br/>\ndaughter spontaneously asks a question or tells me about an observation,<br/>\nthat&#39;s a &quot;test&quot; that shows me unschooling is working.

Is there<br/>\n&gt; ever a point in one&#39;s life where one *must* learn her addition facts,<br/>\n&gt; or her multiplication tables?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a word? No, there isn&#39;t any single point in time where quoting &#39;addition<br/>\nfacts&#39; becomes a life and death issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn another word? Yes, there comes a point where understanding the definition<br/>\nof &quot;addition&quot;/&quot;adding.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich facts are you speaking of?  The fact that 344908452934032 +1 =<br/>\n344908452934033??<br/>\n<br/>\nOr the fact the fact that *addition is the concept of combing two or more<br/>\nunits to find a sum?  And that understanding this *addition fact* (ie the<br/>\ndefinition) comes at the time that each individual is ready to comphrend the<br/>\nidea.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost children come to understand the concept of one cookie plus one cookie<br/>\nequals two cookies rather early.  Way before they are even capable of<br/>\nexplaining with other words that they understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRepeating math additions facts by rote at an early age is a parlor trick.<br/>\nLearning them over time because you use them happens to 99.57% of us by<br/>\ndefault.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not a true unschooler--I&#39;m more of a relaxed homeschooler.<br/>\n&gt; However, I totally unschooled my daughter for math last year, because<br/>\n&gt; she had become so frustrated with math and was going nowhere.  I just<br/>\n&gt; decided to give her a year off.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiving her a year off of school math was a wonderful thing to do. It,<br/>\nhowever, is not unschooling.  There was an expecation of returning to school<br/>\nmath that sort of gets in the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n In that year she did make some<br/>\n&gt; improvement on her own.  She learned how to do double digit addition<br/>\n&gt; with carrying and double digit subtraction with borrowing because she<br/>\n&gt; wanted to buy stuff from her American Girl catalog and adjusted how<br/>\n&gt; much money she had, how much she still needed.  Even though she can<br/>\n&gt; do the double digit addition, she sometims forgets what 6 + 5 is. She<br/>\n&gt; is now 8 and we started back with a math curriculum and she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; struggling again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis speaks volumes to me, but I&#39;d be interested in knowing your thougths on<br/>\nwhy she&#39;s reacting to textbook math by struggling?<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is having trouble with place value--if you<br/>\n&gt; give her  a number of 39, she can&#39;t put 3 10 blocks in the 10 place<br/>\n&gt; and 9 one blocks in the ones place.  If I go back to unschooling her,<br/>\n&gt; will she ever get this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nInherent in this question is an absolute boatload of foundational issues<br/>\nthat I&#39;m not sure we can ferret out together.  Can you see her being 40 and<br/>\nstill unable to understand place value?  It matters not whether you unschool<br/>\nher or continue to make her struggle with a math text, one day this concept<br/>\nof place value will be an aha moment.   She&#39;s gonna get this one way or the<br/>\nother, simply because the world she lives in runs on money and taxes and<br/>\nmortage payments.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question is, rather, is the struggling necessary?  Is knowing place<br/>\nvalue to the hundred thousands something an 8 year old should know or should<br/>\nbe made to struggle to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI, of course, as a long term unschooler will say no. It&#39;s not necessary to<br/>\nwaste a part of her life struggling to get this concept at 8 years old.<br/>\nLife will bring too many of it&#39;s opportunities for this to be learned.  I do<br/>\nnot find value in forcing my children to learn any one fact just because<br/>\nsomeone put it in a book and called it an age appropriate activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if this same 8 year old was begging for her own bank account or wanting<br/>\nto run her own business or any other aspect of living where she NEEDED to<br/>\nunderstand this, then yes, it might be worth sitting with her while she<br/>\nstruggles to grasp the concept.  But then if it&#39;s needed, she&#39;ll be driving<br/>\nthe train and will be willing to struggle.

I should warn you<br/>\nthat I am an independent bookseller and Miquon is one of the products we<br/>\ncarry so I may seem biased, but the reason we carry the Miquon is because we<br/>\nlike it. We could make more money selling Saxon or Math-U-See, but when it<br/>\ncomes to pre-highschool math, we just don&#39;t like them as much and they are<br/>\nmore expensive so we don&#39;t carry them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is something I previously wrote up in response to questions about why I<br/>\nlike Miquon:<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of people are surprised that in the very first Miquon book you get<br/>\ninto things like multiplication and division of fractions. Traditional math<br/>\nprograms don&#39;t get into this type of stuff until much later, but using the<br/>\nrods makes it seem like common sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;Labsheet Annotations&quot; is important to have. Using the Labsheet<br/>\nAnnotations not only gives you explanations of answers and other activities,<br/>\nbut it also has a chart that explains the code letters and numbers on the<br/>\nwork book pages. These codes enable you to use the system in very different<br/>\nways. You can take a standard approach and just go page by page through the<br/>\nbooks. If your child suddenly develops a fascination with fractions, you may<br/>\ndecide that you want to pursue that. The codes will tell you how to skip<br/>\nthrough the books so you can find just the sections on fractions, going from<br/>\nthe introductory concepts to more advanced concepts. This means you can<br/>\neither go through the books page by page to focus on the level of the<br/>\nmaterials, or you can decide to focus on concepts (adding, length, area,<br/>\nvolume, factoring, squaring etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several things I like about the program. One of the first things<br/>\nis the idea of using colors for the different levels instead of ranking them<br/>\nby grade or age. This frustrates some people because they want to know what<br/>\ngrade level their child is at, but I think ability is more important than<br/>\nage and kids should work at their own level and not have to endure negative<br/>\npressure because the book says its for kids younger than them. If grandma<br/>\nasks what level math youre doing and the response is I finished orange and<br/>\nam just starting red, theres no judgmental information there. Colors are<br/>\nneutral unlike grade levels or numbers. (By the way, I think there can be<br/>\njust as much negative pressure if everyone is complimenting the child for<br/>\nbeing ahead of their grade level).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I like is the variety of approaches used. There is good use of<br/>\nmanipulatives and the presentation of problems in a variety of ways. There<br/>\nare also different strategies given for solving problems. For example, one<br/>\nsection on the  addition of a string of numbers shows 8+1+2+9+3=  ? The<br/>\nsolution is not to just get the totals, but to do it by drawing lines to<br/>\nconnect the numbers that add to 10 and then adding them (8+2, 1+9, 3+7).<br/>\n<br/>\nKids too often memorize multiplication tables and learn how to get correct<br/>\nanswers but dont really understand what they are doing. Math is usually<br/>\ntaught as if there is only one right answer and only one right way to get<br/>\nit. But that is not true. At a recent support group meeting, most people<br/>\nsaid that 3x9=27, and they just knew it from memorizing the multiplication<br/>\ntables. I was one of two people that said they rounded the 9 up to 10 and<br/>\nthought of the problem as (3 x 10)- (3x(10-9) or 30-3. This may seem more<br/>\nconvoluted, but it actually can help build important estimation skills and<br/>\nmake it easier to do quick calculations in your head. If your mind works<br/>\nthat way, you should be encouraged to approach math that way instead of by<br/>\nrote memorization of multiplication tables.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like that the program is fairly inexpensive. If you find it doesnt<br/>\nwork for your child, you dont feel the urge to force them to use it to get<br/>\nyour moneys worth. If it works very well and your child wants to move more<br/>\nrapidly, you dont have to feel like holding them back because the next book<br/>\nis so expensive. Although the program is designed for grades 1 through 3,<br/>\nmany people use it for 1 through 6 as you are basically at a pre-algebra<br/>\nlevel when you complete the program.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line is that I think most programs teach you to do math, while this<br/>\none puts more emphasis on understanding it on several levels. You see<br/>\ndifferent strategies for solving problems, you do hands on activities that<br/>\nare fun, and you apply what you learn to different situations. Rote<br/>\nmemorization may be good for tests where there is a time limit and you have<br/>\nto answer quickly, but understanding concepts will help you solve more<br/>\nproblems in the long run (especially later in life after you forget all<br/>\nthose equations that you so diligently memorized for a test).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you made it this far and are interested in more information or a place<br/>\nwhere you can get the entire set of Miquon books for under $50, go to the<br/>\nfollowing web page:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.FUN-Books.com/mathematics.htm#Miquon\">http://www.FUN-Books.com/mathematics.htm#Miquon</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to get so long winded!<br/>\n<br/>\nBilly<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.FUN-Books.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Olivia [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:liv2learn@...\">liv2learn@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know it is not very unschooling-like to ask about this but...<br/>\n&gt; My 7 yo has gotten to a point where he has expressed a need for some<br/>\n&gt; help learning basic math (for scorekeeping in games and managing<br/>\n&gt; money, etc.).

With measuring cups<br/>\nand spoons?  Saving a bunch of change for a couple of weeks, and counting<br/>\nit out (5&#39;s, 10&#39;s, 2&#39;s and multiplication).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was trying to teach our son to count by 2&#39;s (guess what... He learned to<br/>\ncount by 10&#39;s from the table of contents from a book I read to him!  The<br/>\nchapters were by 10&#39;s!) and as I was laying out the pennies, he was<br/>\nignoring me completely (or so I thought).  Next thing I know, somehow I&#39;d<br/>\nlaid out a group of pennies by 3&#39;s (didn&#39;t do it on purpose.  Remember I<br/>\nwas trying to show counting by 2&#39;s here).  He looked at the pennies and<br/>\ndeclared, &quot;Mama, look!  Did you know that three 3&#39;s is 9?!&quot;  And he<br/>\nremembered it from that experience!  The year before, he was looking at his<br/>\nguitar and noticed the three tuning knobs on both sides, and realized that<br/>\n3+3=6, and never forgot it.  If he&#39;d written it 50 times, it would have<br/>\nstayed in memory, but this applied it in such a way that he never forgot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur son learned 10% from the tithe.  Also, you may be surprised at some<br/>\nthings she knows.  I saw on the &quot;curriculum&quot; we were shown, that we were<br/>\nsuppose to &quot;cover&quot; perimeter this year.  I thought this was absurd, for<br/>\nsuch a young child.  Dh disagreed, reciting examples as: &quot;Well what if he<br/>\nwants to put up a fence one day?  He&#39;ll have to know that.&quot;  Well I asked<br/>\ndh when he was ever going to fix the gate, and he said that was beside the<br/>\npoint!  Well, I said, &quot;fine&quot;, and asked our son to pretend that the box was<br/>\na backyard and he wanted to build a fence around it.  Than I asked him how<br/>\nhe would know how much wood to get to build it, how many inches long.  He<br/>\nsaid, &quot;Well, first I&#39;d need a ruler.&quot;  So I got the ruler.  than he said,<br/>\n&quot;And I guess I&#39;d have to measure&quot; and he measured each side of the box! <br/>\netc!  I looked at dh and said, well, perimeter covered! LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how old your daughter is.  But what about helping out with the<br/>\nregistry of the checkbook, or other everyday house mathematical<br/>\nresponsibilities, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also some okay computer programs (i.e., math blaster, jump<br/>\nstart).  they have some fall backs, but she may enjoy it.

And I know she wants me to direct<br/>\n&gt;her more because she told me directly that is what she thought I should do.<br/>\n&gt; Part of my panic came in when her younger sister (who loves math) suddenly<br/>\n&gt;joined her boat and quite doing any at all!

I have - I believe it is possible to be nearly completely<br/>\n&gt;illiterate when it comes to math.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s highly likely that the 18 year old was schooled, and in a position<br/>\nwhere people sat him down and tried to force him to learn math for an hour a<br/>\nday.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing to be teaching our children is *how to learn* when they are *ready<br/>\nto learn*. If your daughter did absolutely NO MATH for four years (an<br/>\nimpossibility, by the way, I&#39;ll get to that in a minute) but she learned the<br/>\npriceless lesson of how to learn something, it would not matter a whit. In<br/>\nfour years, she could say, as Lisa&#39;s daughter did, &quot;Ack! I do not know<br/>\nfractions!&quot; and sit herself down and learn them. Same with anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, really, she can&#39;t &quot;not do math&quot; for four years (or four days). She can<br/>\n&quot;not pick up a math book&quot;, but so what? She could not pick up a math book<br/>\nfor the rest of her natural life and still be a math genius.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath is not just (and not best) in books called &quot;Learn Math in 170 nearly<br/>\npain-free lessons&quot;. Math is all around us. We breath it and live it and sit<br/>\non it all day, every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time your daughter goes to the store and buys something, she uses math<br/>\n(how big a bill do I give them? How much change do I get back? Are these<br/>\npeaches a better bargain, or are those? I have $20.00 and I need to buy<br/>\nthese five things, so can I get the big box of noodles, or only the small<br/>\none?). Every time she looks through a TV Guide she is using math (When does<br/>\nthat program start? Oh, look, this program is on for an hour and overlaps<br/>\nthe other one I want by half an hour, when do I need to start the VCR?).<br/>\nEvery time she helps you pay the bills, budgets the family&#39;s weekly money,<br/>\nis put in charge of the map for a family trip, earns money babysitting the<br/>\nkid next door, has her own savings account and calculates the interest to<br/>\nmake sure the bank has not made an error against her, sits down with her<br/>\nfather and builds a bat or bird or doghouse, she is DOING MATH.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is extremely valuable to an unschooling parent to learn to see what<br/>\n&quot;subject&quot; is inherent in what their children are doing. MUCH more valuable<br/>\nthan sitting and fretting about the child &quot;not doing math&quot; (or science, or<br/>\nreading, or history). The textbooks have nothing to do with it. Look at what<br/>\nyour daughter is *really* doing, play the fun game of translating it all<br/>\ninto &quot;subjects&quot; and ENJOY. It often helps to have other people look at a<br/>\nlist of your daughter&#39;s activities for one week (post it here, I love<br/>\nbreaking things into subjects.) It often helps to keep a journal for a month<br/>\non &quot;what my kids did all day&quot; and then read back and be amazed by what they<br/>\ndid learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a the overwhelming myth that learning is hard, must be linear,<br/>\ncomes only with textbooks and teachers. One afternoon building that<br/>\nbirdhouse teaches your daughter more about geometry than a semester of<br/>\nsitting bored in a classroom (or against her will with Mom at the kitchen<br/>\ntable).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is entirely likely that at some stage your daughter will want to do more<br/>\n&quot;academically formal&quot; work. The key here is that the timetable is HERS. She<br/>\nmay want to do three &quot;chapters of math&quot; next week, or it might not be for<br/>\nthree years. It doesn&#39;t matter, in the meantime she is still learning and<br/>\nliving math.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive her real life things that involve math. Teach her to balance the family<br/>\ncheckbook and put her in charge of it each month when the bank statement<br/>\ncomes. Put her in charge of clipping coupons on things you use and let her<br/>\nhave half the money she saves from the grocery bill for her own use. Play<br/>\npoker for penny stakes to teach about probability. Yahtzee is the best math<br/>\ngame ever. There are a million ways for a child to see the fun and use of<br/>\nmath, and one sure way (enforced drudgery over math books) to kill any sense<br/>\nof that fun. If she has been schooled, or forced into curriculum, in the<br/>\npast, she will have a lot of healing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tea Lover Denise","from":"Tea Lover Denise &lt;jalecroy@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"bO2rxBdffPk0CTYl7_vn5OcENAuu2I898Z5ed3s-o7s6ZH_zYnCh6_czLpYr4fOoMvTeH7Iw4zOKFCasVwtpPz7JA44UjQ8wZlmZMrz_","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Math","postDate":"928778342","msgId":719,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy42Mi43MTkuOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":266,"nextInTopic":4488,"prevInTime":718,"nextInTime":720,"topicId":266,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"FYI, I recently bought my oldest daughter (BS, Math) a book entitled, The Universe and The Teacup ~ The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty by K.C.
