I had been a member of this list and others for years before we left to go with Darin on the truck. And one of the things that always stood out to me was that an anonymous someone would join, not wait the requested reading/reviewing time, jump in and almost immediately attack. Sometimes the attack will be directed at the list as a whole, often it is directed at one particular person, Sandra mostly. I don&#39;t quite understand why though, Pam and Joyce are moderators as well. Ren, Kelly, Rue, Karen, Betsy, the list is long on members who are active and vocal. *Maybe it is because Sandra is the Doddess.* &lt;eg&gt; People recognize that *trait* even in VR, because they probably haven&#39;t met her IRL. <br/>\n <br/>\nRegardless though, whether it is a singular person or the list as a whole that is attacked, this list prevails. It goes on, weathers the storm... We get floods of emails in our boxes. Digest members get longer digests and more of them throughout the day. This goes on for (usually) a week or so and then the offending party fades away. Many times said person starts their own list (or in this case goes back to their list to *report* and bash) and most times the list lasts for a few months and then dries up in the backwaters of Yahoo Groups. Historically though, this list continues. To me, (in this case) historical proof is as good as scientific proof that unschooling works. If unschooling didn&#39;t work then this list wouldn&#39;t work. Schuyler is right, it would be easy to end up bitter, it says something that we don&#39;t though. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler Waynforth &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:s.waynforth@...\">s.waynforth@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nI went to look at Michael Atherton&#39;s group last night.
