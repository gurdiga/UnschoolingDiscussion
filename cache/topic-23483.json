And this, I think is exactly on target:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;It seems to me that your friend feels the need to justify what she has done<br/>\nwith her life by belittling the choices you have made in yours.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the friend&#39;s decisions are behind her and too late to change.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSad but too true:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;She clearly has no real respect for children if she believes they cannot<br/>\nlearn without being forced to, and she definitely has no respect for<br/>\nparents.   Another good reason to keep our kids of public school.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If I had to respond to the letter, I would simply say &quot;time will tell&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah wrote that, and it&#39;s good.  One thing I&#39;ve heard people say which then <br/>\nkind of give the public school teachers a fright they must cover up is <br/>\nsomething along the lines of &quot;Well if they get all messed up and don&#39;t learn <br/>\nanything I&#39;ll put them in public school and the special ed teachers can get <br/>\nthem all caught up!&quot;  And then you have to smile your biggest, most innocent <br/>\nand eager smile.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHEY know special ed teachers aren&#39;t in the business of getting people caught <br/>\nup. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;As to the parts of speech, it is necessary to have an understanding of them <br/>\nfor proper written communication.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo you don&#39;t.   Richard Prystowsky and I just did a workshop three days ago <br/>\nabout writing, and the formal study of grammar NOT being required for people <br/>\nto be good writers.   It&#39;s like reading/writing music and being a musician.  <br/>\nSome of the greatest musicians don&#39;t read music.  Some very great writers <br/>\ncan&#39;t &quot;dissect a sentence&quot; in formal terminology.  Conversely, you ALL know, <br/>\nsome sentence-diagramming-champions can&#39;t write anything worth reading, and <br/>\nsome kids who get A&#39;s in music theory don&#39;t have the first clue how to get <br/>\nreal music out of an instrument.  Maybe they can hit the right keys on a <br/>\npiano or throw together a series of fingerings on a clarinet, but are still <br/>\ntone-deaf and rhythm-free, let alone devoid of musical artistry.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrammar does not lead to writing.  Grammar is a thing unto itself, like <br/>\ntheoretical math, or computer-modelling of choregoraphy.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Your example of war.....if the child doesn&#39;t learn about the concept, they <br/>\nwon&#39;t understand it in a book. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs she suggesting ROTC or violent video games or re-runs of CBS news from <br/>\n1968 or WHAT!?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;However, the real cap on the futility of the discussion is her repeated<br/>\nharping on dissecting a sentence.  Except for English teachers or sometimes<br/>\non these lists, how many people EVER in their whole lives will have to<br/>\ndissect a sentence!  Geez Louise, that woman needs to get over herself and<br/>\nget a real life!&gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought that too.  I wondered if she really meant to say &quot;diagramming a <br/>\nsentence&quot; or &quot;analyzing sentence structure&quot; because &quot;dissect&quot; is not the <br/>\nterminology used for sentences in my experience.  I have an English degree <br/>\nand I&#39;ve taught English composition.  I understood it though, and I&#39;m willing <br/>\nto have people use English pretty much as they want if it makes good sense, <br/>\nso I found it perfectly descriptive, but odd.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess she LOVES science and reading and not that other stuff!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;That is the mentality of a teacher, they are trained to teach...and test <br/>\ntest test to make sure Johnny remembers from Tuesday to Friday what he was <br/>\ntold. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOH yes, and if the kid repeatedly fails to perform on Fridays, it&#39;s HIS <br/>\nfault, or his parents&#39; fault, or there&#39;s something wrong with him.

If anything sounds familiar it is because I have learned so much<br/>\nfrom you all here, from Sandra and Joyce and others. :)  I feel like I have<br/>\nexplained myself very well but I don&#39;t think she understands at all.<br/>\n&gt; *******<br/>\n&gt; I was also a bit skeptical of unschooling until I did more reading and<br/>\nresearch.  And now, having done it for 7 years &lt;g&gt; watching how both of my<br/>\nchildren learn and how they process information, I wouldn&#39;t have it any<br/>\nother way.  I can tailor the way I present information to their individual<br/>\nlearning styles.  Have you read any books by John Holt or John Taylor Gatto?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t believe that there is a set body of knowledge that everyone needs<br/>\nto learn, in a set order, over a period of months or years.  Imagine a sheet<br/>\nof paper representing all of the knowledge in the world.  Now place a dot on<br/>\nthe paper.  This is what schools have deemed important.  But what if my dot<br/>\nis across the page?  And my child&#39;s dot is in yet another place?  A child<br/>\nimmersed in the world can make connections between history and math and<br/>\nscience, and connect their own dots.  Not everyone is a scientist.  Not<br/>\neveryone is a writer.  Not everyone is an athlete.  Not everyone wants or<br/>\nneeds to go to college (depends upon their field of interest).  A child<br/>\n(especially an older child or teen) who immerses himself/herself into a<br/>\ntopic of choice (be it marine biology, art, ancient Egypt, or even  Pokemon<br/>\nor Nintendo), over time, will cover all of the basic &quot;subjects&quot;  ie reading,<br/>\nmath, history,science, geography, etc.  Because one thing leads to another,<br/>\nto another, etc.  It happens naturally.  And things learned this way are<br/>\nlearned for life.  They are not studied to be tested on an then forgotten.<br/>\nThink of the knowledge you use on a daily basis in your normal activities.<br/>\nHow much did you learn in school?  How much did you learn on your own<br/>\nbecause you were interested?  How much did you learn in school but forgot<br/>\n(ie what was the war of 1812 about?) but you know where to look up the<br/>\ninformation if you ever needed it?  You remember the things you need to know<br/>\nand the things that interest you, and the rest is forgotten.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My kids are exposed to all kinds of things every day.  We have tons of<br/>\nbooks, resources, and materials that they can use.  We go to the aquarium.<br/>\nSturbridge Village (a history museum of America in the 1830&#39;s).  The Science<br/>\nCenter.  The children&#39;s museum.  State parks.  Camping. The post office.<br/>\nThe library. Swimming lessons.  Ice skating lessons. Homeschool playgroups.<br/>\nThe phone guy adding a new phone line. Looking in the microscope a worm<br/>\neggs. Watching surgery.  Discussions about all kinds of things happen<br/>\nthroughout the day.  Spelling, math, history, geography, etc.  It&#39;s fun to<br/>\nsee even Thomas making connections.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling is trusting in a child&#39;s natural curiosity to teach them what<br/>\nthey need to know. The parent is there to answer questions, talk, infect the<br/>\nkids by their own curiosity about life! (though curious about what they&#39;re<br/>\ninterested rather in what you think would be good for the them to be<br/>\ninterested in!), and surround them with lots of resources and supplies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The hard parts are 1) trusting natural curiosity to draw your child to<br/>\nwhat they need to learn when. Math is fascinating when you can see how it<br/>\nrelates to every day living; 2) trusting your child&#39;s natural schedule<br/>\nrather than the school imposed one (eg, that the child will read eventually<br/>\neven if they aren&#39;t doing so at 7, they will multiply even if they aren&#39;t<br/>\ndoing it at 9); 3)  trusting that it&#39;s okay for kids to learn things out of<br/>\norder! It doesn&#39;t bother kids at all to pick up interesting tidbits about<br/>\nThomas Jefferson, knightly armor, Egyptian mummies, WW2 combat planes. They<br/>\nmake their own connections as they get more and more things in place.<br/>\n(Later, an orderly approach will be fascinating to them as they can make<br/>\neven more connections.); 4)  seeing real learning that is right there all<br/>\naround you, for example, the things that need sorted, the cookies to divide,<br/>\nthe planning for a party that are all real live math. And it&#39;s especially<br/>\ntough to trust that those few minutes of real engaged figuring are worth 20<br/>\npages of worksheet practice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I appreciate your input.  I know where Caroline&#39;s strengths and weaknesses<br/>\nare and I find creative ways to encourage her in those weak areas by<br/>\nsneaking it into something she&#39;s interested in.  She is very strong in math,<br/>\nscience, and geography, right on target with reading but way ahead in<br/>\ncomprehension, and very weak with her handwriting.  So far it&#39;s working for<br/>\nus.  However, we have also seen it work fabulously in the adult world.<br/>\nAllen taught himself to program computers.  By reading, doing, and asking<br/>\nquestions of those who knew how.  Then he took a 6 week computer course, and<br/>\nsince then has taught himself several more languages with which to code.<br/>\nThe neat  part is that most of his coworkers learned computers in school.<br/>\nAnd who do they turn to when they can&#39;t solve a complex problem?  Or when<br/>\nthe code they wrote is slow to perform?  They come to Allen because he can<br/>\nthink &quot;outside of the box&quot; and can solve problems readily (and I mean<br/>\nproblems that have stumped numerous people for months), and has code that he<br/>\nwrote run in 5 minutes while the other guy&#39;s is still running an hour<br/>\nlater.....And he was 35....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just some perspective from the other side of the educational fence :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Janet<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Her reply:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree that it&#39;s a system that can work as long as the parent is<br/>\nintelligent and presents opportunities for learning.  Learning is a totally<br/>\nnatural process, you can&#39;t keep a child from learning.  Learning Math is a<br/>\nnatural process.  Children should know what 5 X 3 looks like......they<br/>\nshould use manipulatives to see what 5 X 3 looks like.  It should not be<br/>\ntaught by rote memory because all math is connected.

If anything sounds familiar it is because I have learned so much from you all here, from Sandra and Joyce and others. :)  I feel like I have explained myself very well but I don&#39;t think she understands at all.<br/>\n*******<br/>\nI was also a bit skeptical of unschooling until I did more reading and research.  And now, having done it for 7 years &lt;g&gt; watching how both of my children learn and how they process information, I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.  I can tailor the way I present information to their individual learning styles.  Have you read any books by John Holt or John Taylor Gatto? <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe that there is a set body of knowledge that everyone needs to learn, in a set order, over a period of months or years.  Imagine a sheet of paper representing all of the knowledge in the world.  Now place a dot on the paper.  This is what schools have deemed important.  But what if my dot is across the page?  And my child&#39;s dot is in yet another place?  A child immersed in the world can make connections between history and math and science, and connect their own dots.  Not everyone is a scientist.  Not everyone is a writer.  Not everyone is an athlete.  Not everyone wants or needs to go to college (depends upon their field of interest).  A child (especially an older child or teen) who immerses himself/herself into a topic of choice (be it marine biology, art, ancient Egypt, or even  Pokemon or Nintendo), over time, will cover all of the basic &quot;subjects&quot;  ie reading, math, history,science, geography, etc.  Because one thing leads to another, to another, etc.  It happens naturally.  And things learned this way are learned for life.  They are not studied to be tested on an then forgotten.  Think of the knowledge you use on a daily basis in your normal activities.  How much did you learn in school?  How much did you learn on your own because you were interested?  How much did you learn in school but forgot (ie what was the war of 1812 about?) but you know where to look up the information if you ever needed it?  You remember the things you need to know and the things that interest you, and the rest is forgotten. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are exposed to all kinds of things every day.  We have tons of books, resources, and materials that they can use.  We go to the aquarium. Sturbridge Village (a history museum of America in the 1830&#39;s).  The Science Center.  The children&#39;s museum.  State parks.  Camping. The post office.  The library. Swimming lessons.  Ice skating lessons. Homeschool playgroups. The phone guy adding a new phone line. Looking in the microscope a worm eggs. Watching surgery.  Discussions about all kinds of things happen throughout the day.  Spelling, math, history, geography, etc.  It&#39;s fun to see even Thomas making connections. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is trusting in a child&#39;s natural curiosity to teach them what they need to know. The parent is there to answer questions, talk, infect the kids by their own curiosity about life! (though curious about what they&#39;re interested rather in what you think would be good for the them to be interested in!), and surround them with lots of resources and supplies. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe hard parts are 1) trusting natural curiosity to draw your child to what they need to learn when. Math is fascinating when you can see how it relates to every day living; 2) trusting your child&#39;s natural schedule rather than the school imposed one (eg, that the child will read eventually even if they aren&#39;t doing so at 7, they will multiply even if they aren&#39;t doing it at 9); 3)  trusting that it&#39;s okay for kids to learn things out of order! It doesn&#39;t bother kids at all to pick up interesting tidbits about Thomas Jefferson, knightly armor, Egyptian mummies, WW2 combat planes. They make their own connections as they get more and more things in place. (Later, an orderly approach will be fascinating to them as they can make even more connections.); 4)  seeing real learning that is right there all around you, for example, the things that need sorted, the cookies to divide, the planning for a party that are all real live math. And it&#39;s especially tough to trust that those few minutes of real engaged figuring are worth 20 pages of worksheet practice. <br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate your input.  I know where Caroline&#39;s strengths and weaknesses are and I find creative ways to encourage her in those weak areas by sneaking it into something she&#39;s interested in.  She is very strong in math, science, and geography, right on target with reading but way ahead in comprehension, and very weak with her handwriting.  So far it&#39;s working for us.  However, we have also seen it work fabulously in the adult world.  Allen taught himself to program computers.  By reading, doing, and asking questions of those who knew how.  Then he took a 6 week computer course, and since then has taught himself several more languages with which to code.  The neat  part is that most of his coworkers learned computers in school.  And who do they turn to when they can&#39;t solve a complex problem?  Or when the code they wrote is slow to perform?  They come to Allen because he can think &quot;outside of the box&quot; and can solve problems readily (and I mean problems that have stumped numerous people for months), and has code that he wrote run in 5 minutes while the other guy&#39;s is still running an hour later.....And he was 35.... <br/>\n<br/>\nJust some perspective from the other side of the educational fence :) <br/>\n<br/>\nJanet <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHer reply:<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that it&#39;s a system that can work as long as the parent is intelligent and presents opportunities for learning.  Learning is a totally natural process, you can&#39;t keep a child from learning.  Learning Math is a natural process.  Children should know what 5 X 3 looks like......they should use manipulatives to see what 5 X 3 looks like.  It should not be taught by rote memory because all math is connected.  I understand.......I just see too many people abusive a perfectly good system.  Yes I have read your books.  I agree with the authors for the most part.  I&#39;ve taught several seminars demonstrating the method that you use.  (There are teachers out there who only know how to teach with a paper a pencil.)  As long as you are challenging Caroline in the areas she isn&#39;t naturally curious about.  Your example of war.....if the child doesn&#39;t learn about the concept, they won&#39;t understand it in a book.  I know that Caroline likes fish, but somewhere along the line she&#39;s going to have to learn how to dissect a sentence and I doubt she&#39;ll come to you and be begging for you to teach that concept.  Balance is what I&#39;m talking about.......I know you&#39;ll do a great job.<br/>\n<br/>\nkim   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Janet F Hamlin","from":"&quot;Janet F Hamlin&quot; &lt;jefhdvm@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"UZL9yTF-ChD5Ff0433BfqO1cJY_QF4rSw2qoZZ_DVWhUW7cI4Dg3LnLSUAmX5XQbexuS0BSV6bMSWnLa0B-snVZKxQdCJL6fqws","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: How to respond?","postDate":"998493738","msgId":23495,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYTkwMWMxMmIxZSQ3YzE4ZDUyMCQ4ZGRlZmVhOUB0aWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23493,"nextInTopic":23496,"prevInTime":23494,"nextInTime":23496,"topicId":23483,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Am I the one who just doesn t get it?

And.. well... who made her the person to figure out what<br/>\nis appropiate for other families?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; child suffers by becoming strong in areas of science and reading.....areas<br/>\n&gt; that all children adore......but fall behind in math or language/writing<br/>\n&gt; skills.  They don&#39;t know what a preposition is and can&#39;t write an<br/>\n&gt; intelligent paper.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, this is a personal bias.   Not ALL children adore reading or science.<br/>\nCertainly not all of mine do.  Knowing or not knowing what a preposition is,<br/>\nis not a measuring stick for a well-educated person, and certainly not the<br/>\nmeasure of a balanced child.  Knowing how to write well is a wonderful<br/>\nthing, something most of our children will learn to do at some point. The<br/>\nkicker is that not all children will want to learn the same skills at the<br/>\nsame time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome sort of assessment lets the parent know where they<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; need to devote more time to create a balanced learner.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Living with a child 24/7 will tell you much more than a paper and pencil<br/>\nassessment. Especially when that assessment which is created by some other<br/>\nadult with their own bias of what is and is not important knowlege.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA smart parent will<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; use the interests of the child to teach the subjects that the child<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; normally approach on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sigh.  She&#39;s not listening to you or even thinking about alternative values.<br/>\nI simply do not value all school subjects equally.<br/>\n<br/>\n Just letting the child do whatever they<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; want and learn whatever they want is not a method that I would endorse.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She&#39;s not listening.  Equating *doing whatever they want* with *learning<br/>\nwhatever they want*, is simply a failure to comprehend. She&#39;s using<br/>\nemotionaly charged language to place shame or guilt.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; creating an atmosphere that is conducive to learning and leading the child<br/>\n&gt; through the learning process is a method that I continually endorse.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She&#39;s a teacher, how can she not see her position as important. If children<br/>\ndon&#39;t need *leading*, then what has she done with her life?<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a method that takes a lot of preparation on behalf of the parent......it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; not a method for the average lazy, stupid parent.

Ask her how many 12th graders she knows who can remember their 9th<br/>\ngrade civics lessons. IF this were true, why do we have milllions upon<br/>\nmillions of high school graduates who can&#39;t remember anything from 12 years<br/>\nof history classes?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour article is interesting,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but having raised 4 children, it is seriously flawed in spots.

Parenting is<br/>\nsomething we all do, whether we unschool are not. She&#39;s conflating what<br/>\nparents do for their children with the idea of standards in education.  The<br/>\nintegration of expectations is inherent in our daily lives.

Eldest daughter *loves* reading and writing, likes<br/>\nmath and hates science.  Eldest son hated schooly type anything but loves<br/>\nworking with his hands and now, at age 30 has discovered reading.  Second<br/>\nson *loves* writing and has since he was old enough to hold a pencil.  He is<br/>\no.k., with reading and math but hates science.  Third son *hates* reading<br/>\nbut *loves* math and science and only touches a pencil when threatened with<br/>\ndeath or not getting his check cashed &lt;g&gt;  Next to youngest kidlet *hates*<br/>\nmath but *loves* science and is o.k. with reading and writing.  Youngest<br/>\n*loves* writing, writing and more writing and thinks math is too easy and<br/>\nreading is o.k. but only if it is the right book.  Science is o.k too if it<br/>\nis about plants and animals.  Oh, and as of today, chemistry as in cooking<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, hello, there is no right way to use homeschooling.  That is one of the<br/>\npoints!  And, I think perhaps that writing will not explain it to her, she<br/>\nwill have to experience a day with unschoolers and when it is one of &quot;those&quot;<br/>\ndays, she is going to wonder how the parent survives it!  Personally, today<br/>\nI am exhausted since they haven&#39;t stopped since 6:23 this morning!<br/>\n<br/>\nToday was one of those days!  Youngest found a math workbook and buzzed<br/>\nthrough 58 pages (gee, I don&#39;t know why anyone doesn&#39;t like math, it is<br/>\nsoooo easy).  She then went out and worked in her garden and asked a million<br/>\nquestion about soils and asked for &quot;the stuff that tells if the soil is<br/>\nright.&quot;  Then she headed for the dictionary because she wanted to be sure<br/>\nshe was using the right word when she put lawn clippings around her<br/>\nstrawberry plants (mulch, not munch &lt;g&gt;).  Next was &quot;baking&quot; non-bake peanut<br/>\nbutter and oatmeal cookies and the million questions about how come some<br/>\ncookies have to be baked and how come some don&#39;t.  She then dug out an old<br/>\ncookbook that includes a lot of simple chemistry type explanations of how<br/>\nthings work.  She liked the part about the eggs the best.  Gee fun, she<br/>\nwants to try three ways to make an omelet tomorrow morning so she can see<br/>\nwhich way puffs up the most and which way she likes the taste of the most.<br/>\n<br/>\nEldest at home kidlet was balancing his checkbook, then off to work and<br/>\nafter work was off to see about buying a car.  He spent last night using<br/>\nloan calculators to determine what he could afford and was using an<br/>\nanalyzing program he found to see what it would cost him in a year to<br/>\noperate various models.  He then headed down to the library to check out<br/>\nChilton&#39;s to see how hard the various models would be to work on himself.<br/>\nThen he sound some thingy on the net that tells average life spans etc. on<br/>\nvarious models.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiddle at home kidlet was busy with his paper route and figuring what he was<br/>\ngetting paid if it was by the hour and how long it is going to take him to<br/>\nsave up enough money to buy his very own personal computer (he doesn&#39;t like<br/>\nto share).  He came home and plopped when he was done, made his lunch,<br/>\ngrabbed a book and &quot;chilled.&quot;  Then he was off to visit a friend who is<br/>\ngoing to work with him on a science fair project for next year.  They have<br/>\nalready bought the hardware they need and are now working out the backboard<br/>\ndesign.  They have been busy reading science journals, science fair project<br/>\nbooks and various books on electricity and steam.  They already have a draft<br/>\nbooklet in the computer ready to print and proof that they plan to hang on<br/>\ntheir backboard.  They both came home for dinner and then put up the tent in<br/>\nthe backyard.  They set up the telescope and are hoping it stays clear until<br/>\nit is really dark.  They have his sky star chart set up and are going to see<br/>\nhow many more of the stars they can find and identify.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to ages, well, they don&#39;t fit into the 2-2nd grade.
