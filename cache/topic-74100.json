But her whole family fell ill while we were in the city.  We were close enough to home that we could have gone home but somehow, I don&#39;t even remember how, we ended up staying with another family that we had met &quot;online&quot;.  We even had an offer from yet *another* family that we knew online.  (I think we had all agreed to meet at the Franklin Institute because that is where we met).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe slept on her living room floor.  I have to confess, it was quite the adventure, staying at a stranger&#39;s house, sleeping on their floor!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeday I&#39;ll have to write a book about untraveling!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, June 13, 2003 10:45 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] engraved invite<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;Where do you live???
