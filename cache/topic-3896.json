That is so generous of you to offer to have him go <br/>\nthere.  I don&#39;t think his parents would consider that right now but we are <br/>\ngoing to research all that we can and use the time until Dec 6.  when he has <br/>\nto go back to court.

I really would like <br/>\nsomeone to investigate what&#39;s going on in that town because it goes far <br/>\nbeyond this situation.<br/>\n    During the last school year, my nephew went back to get a book from his <br/>\nlocker, then saw a friend and started talking instead of hurrying to class, <br/>\nand was taken to the office for truancy.  They called the police who gave him <br/>\na ticket, handcuffed him, and took him to where his father worked since his <br/>\nmother wasn&#39;t home at the time.  These kinds of things are happening all the <br/>\ntime in Lancaster now and it is making too many people there lose all faith <br/>\nin the justice system.  <br/>\n    I love the motto at the Natural Child website (children behave as well as <br/>\nthey are treated).  I think it would be great if we all marched around the <br/>\nschool there holding up signs that said just that.  I believe some of those <br/>\nadults need to be shamed into remembering the ideals they must have once had <br/>\nand seeing how far away from them they now are.  <br/>\n    Thanks so much to everyone for all the support and ideas.

I also would flee <br/>\nthe state if they were going to put my child in one of those camps, <br/>\nparticularly under these circumstances.  But his parents are not in a <br/>\nposition to do so.  They are also probably going to have to rely on the <br/>\npublic defender as his attorney.  I&#39;m afraid he will be just another number <br/>\nto the public defender.  There are other kids with similar situations whom he <br/>\nis representing and they are all being handled similarily.  He also asked <br/>\nwhether his stuttering and words delay was real or &quot;just an act.&quot;  He said, <br/>\n&quot;you know how these kids are.&quot;<br/>\n     I also feel it is outrageous.  I think I mentioned that this is a first <br/>\noffense for him.  How can anyone think that he&#39;s going to come out of that <br/>\ncamp better or that this is a good thing for our society?  I really am <br/>\nbothered by the tie-in between the school district, police, and courts in <br/>\nLancaster.  I question whether it is constitutional because I don&#39;t see a lot <br/>\nof due process in many of their procedures.  Parents are given tickets when <br/>\ntheir kids violate the rules (dress code, being late to class, missing too <br/>\nmuch school, etc.) and they just have to pay them.  Worse, this is a <br/>\ncommunity that has been hit hard by recession and tends to have a lot of <br/>\nfamilies on low incomes who lack the resources to fight this.<br/>\n     I don&#39;t know exactly how to get the word out on this.  I even tried <br/>\ncontacting the ACLU because I thought they looked at cases that they felt <br/>\nwere constitutional violations but they haven&#39;t returned my calls.  Maybe I <br/>\nshould call the L.A. Times.  I don&#39;t know if the local Lancaster newspaper <br/>\nwill respond to this because it is so common there.<br/>\n     Your web site looks interesting.
