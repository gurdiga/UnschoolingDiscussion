I need to \nmake this clear, as any counsellor-type will know, so that no-one thinks I talk \nabout breastfeeding on&nbsp;LLL&#39;s behalf, yet.&nbsp; But I too groaned when I \nread this post, not only because of its inflamatorry nature, but because this is \nexactly the kind of superiority complex which puts some people off \nbreastfeeding.&nbsp; Breastfeeding is natural.&nbsp; Breastmilk is what babies&#39; \nsytems are designed to deal with.&nbsp; That does not mean that bottlefeeding, \n&#39;with safety and love&#39; as Bill and Martha Sears&#39; Baby Book says, cannot meet the \nneeds of babies who cannot be breastfed.&nbsp; </font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"2\">I think Stephanie&#39;s husband would read this message and be \nmore put off.&nbsp; It would be more helpful for him to talk to other fathers \nwho support their partner&#39;s feeding choices.&nbsp; My dh said, when asked how \nmany times dd2 woke in the night, &#39;I don&#39;t know,&#39; I don&#39;t wake up.&#39;&nbsp; A \nmajor benefit for the co-sleeping, breastfeeding father!!</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"2\">Dogmatics and rants don&#39;t change people&#39;s minds, nor can they \nchange the fact that some people physically can&#39;t breastfeed.&nbsp; There&#39;s \nenough aggro in the world without adding to it.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font size=\"2\">Tracy</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:monkeycoop@...\"\n title=\"monkeycoop@...\">monkeycoop@...</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\"\n title=\"Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Wednesday, April 05, 2000 3:09 \n  PM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] \n  champagne moment... </div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>In a message dated 4/5/00 2:36:58 AM Central Daylight Time, \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sulan@...\">sulan@...</a> <br>writes:<br><br>&lt;&lt;
