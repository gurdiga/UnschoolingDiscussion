The Texas Memorial Museum<br/>\nhas millions of fossils in its collections. Spanning hundreds of<br/>\nmillions of years, our fossils tell the story of the natural history of<br/>\nTexas. At any given time, however, only a fraction of TMM&#39;s fossils are<br/>\non display in exhibits. The rest are in our research labs, on loan to<br/>\nother museums around the world, or stored in our collection areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis exhibit allows us to show off some of TMM&#39;s finest fossils. Some,<br/>\nlike the saber-toothed cat and the exquisite starfish from South Austin,<br/>\nare old favorites that haven&#39;t been on display in<br/>\nyears. Others, like Chasmosaurus and the plesiosaur, are newer<br/>\nacquisitions that have never been seen in public. In addition to our own<br/>\nspecimens, we are fortunate enough to have a few rare pieces on loan for<br/>\nthis exhibit. Two specimens are on loan from other museums:<br/>\nConfuciusornis from the Beijing Museum of Natural History, and<br/>\nThrinaxodon from The University of California at Berkeley. In addition,<br/>\nDiplocaulus is on loan from a private collector. We are grateful to<br/>\nthese lenders for allowing us the chance to display their specimens.<br/>\n<br/>\nlink: Scratching the Surface Again!
