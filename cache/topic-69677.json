(After a week of reading.)  And it is<br/>\n&gt; *definitely* okay to ask about the SC conference, even if you are the<br/>\n&gt; umpty-umpth person asking.  In fact, even though it would be tad<br/>\n&gt; repetitive, it would be GREAT to have someone new, or newly &quot;aware&quot; ask<br/>\n&gt; about it every single day between now and August.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wishing Kelly a very successful event and wishing I were on the East coast,<br/>\n&gt; Betsy<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you, Betsy!
