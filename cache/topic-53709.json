It seemed to be an obsession, but flying by the seat of my pants, I didn&#39;t try to change his listening habits though a lot of what I heard him listen to went against my grain.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe started to use his own money to buy CD&#39;s with parental advisories on them.  I had a basic trust and respect for his long term innate goodness.  I asked that he listen to those CD&#39;s in his room as he had a little 2 year old brother running around that was a little sharpy.  When we were all in the car he chose the radio station and any time a song was coming on that he knew had mature lyrics he would turn it off out of respect for his little brother.   In those days he said his little brother was his &quot;best friend&quot; even though he did enjoy friends of his own age.  A girl down the street that was 14 came over to our house just to hear the CD&#39;s because her parents would not allow them in the house.  This girl was a public schooler and did not live the tame life my son did as they both got older.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my grown son is one of the kindest, most unselfish, most trustworthy people I know; a real credit to this planet.  He is a music major, well liked by students and teachers and enjoys all kinds of music.  He has composed gentle love songs, a few rap songs, film scores, video game music, classical type music,etc.  He is not an angry or depressed type that so many of the lyrics he listened to as a young teen portrayed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI truly hope that my 2nd son does not feel compelled to listen to CD&#39;s with parental advisories but I would make the same decision as I did the first time.  I think &quot;compelled&quot; is the key word here.  It wasn&#39;t a passing curiousity that my son could be distracted away from.  It was almost a need of some sort that had to be respected.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nSuzanne<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Pam Hartley <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, January 07, 2003 8:16 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Grand Theft Auto<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ----------<br/>\n  &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  &gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2812<br/>\n  &gt;Date: Tue, Jan 7, 2003, 4:07 PM<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Do you keep murder mysteries out of your house lest he become a murderer?
