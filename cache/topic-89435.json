Sydney 8, is extremely helpful and confident about taking<br/>\ncare of Anika 3, and b/c she&#39;s so good at it, the temptation is there to<br/>\nexpect her to pitch in whenever it would be especially convenient for me.  I<br/>\nthrew my back out a few weeks ago and have been trying not to lift or bend<br/>\ntoo much to let it heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Anika woke up in the living room and started crying while S and I<br/>\nwere reading in the bedroom.  S said &quot; o, mom, you stay here.  I&#39;ll get her,<br/>\nthat way you won&#39;t hurt your back.&quot;  Not only did she go get her but she<br/>\ncarried her 50lb sister to her mommy while speaking soothingly to her.  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t ask her to help just then but I&#39;ve a feeling she wouldn&#39;t have taken<br/>\nsuch joy in the task if it had been expected of her.  Other times I might<br/>\nask her to do something for her sister to speed things up on my agenda and<br/>\nshe&#39;s just as likely to say no.  I guess that&#39;s ok too.  I sure do like it<br/>\nwhen she does things like that on her own.  How *can* she if I&#39;m always<br/>\nasking?<br/>\n<br/>\n-krisula<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;So I think you have to let go of the control. If Sarah wasn&#39;t there, the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>baby would cry while you helped Logan or Logan would throw up on his own or<br/>\nyou&#39;d hold the baby the best you could while helping your son.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Ask her for whatever help she can give, offer some suggestions and then<br/>\n </span></blockquote>let<br/>\ngo. You could say, &quot;Would you mind doing something with the baby? Maybe you<br/>\ncould try giving her a bottle, since that sounds like her hungry cry to me,&quot;<br/>\nthen let go of control. (That&#39;ll be the hard part!) And when the crisis is<br/>\nover say &quot;Thanks ever so much!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Maybe it would help to reread what you wrote and substitute yourself in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>for<br/>\nSarah and your husband in for yourself. Imagine that he&#39;s doing something<br/>\nthat seems totally ridiculous to you, like juggling flaming torches and<br/>\nwants you to handle one set in a particular way while he handles the ones<br/>\nthat are giving him trouble. That&#39;s quite likely the way she sees it until<br/>\nshe can get to the point where she knows whatever help she can do will be<br/>\nappreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8178,"nextTopicId":89304}}
