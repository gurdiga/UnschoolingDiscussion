It doesn&#39;t work.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can teach ANY child to read before they are<br/>\nready to learn.  Nor can you teach them anything else<br/>\nbefore they are ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe says, &quot;Left alone, dyslexic children learn things<br/>\ntheir way. Home schooling is great for them, because<br/>\nthey can learn things the way it works for them, not<br/>\nthe way a teacher presents things to a classroom! &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll children would learn things much differently than<br/>\nthe way a teacher presents things in a classroom if<br/>\nleft to learn their own way, not just dyslexic<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe says, &quot;Also, check to see if the child is &quot;cross<br/>\ndominant&quot; - meaning a right handed child with a<br/>\ndominant left eye or vice versa.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut according to this website: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www3.azwestern.edu/psy/dgershaw/lol/Handedness.html\">http://www3.azwestern.edu/psy/dgershaw/lol/Handedness.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The main reason for handedness lies in hereditary<br/>\nfactors that determine which side of the brain will be<br/>\nmore developed and therefore dominant. ***Typically<br/>\nthe left side of the brain controls the left side of<br/>\nthe head but the right side of the body*** � indicated<br/>\nby the shaded portions of the figure.

I know I don&#39;t do anything differently<br/>\nfor my son based on the knowledge that he is dyslexic,<br/>\nbut I do things uniquely based on his interests and<br/>\ndesires, as I do for my other two children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help school-at-homers, though, to relax a bit<br/>\nand not try to make their dyslexic child fit into the<br/>\nsame mold as their other children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwifetovegman<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew Yahoo!
