The adults have the downstairs and the kids <br/>\nhave the upstairs.  Upstairs has an activity room with lots of bins full of <br/>\nstuff -- science stuff or train tracks or videos and a game that go together <br/>\nor puzzles or origami books ad supplies or dinosaur stuff, etc.  Then they <br/>\nhave a kid-sized couches and tables reading area.  There are bean bags on the <br/>\nother side for the bigger kids.  Lots of computers -- although during the <br/>\nsummer there was an actual waiting period of about 5 minutes to get on one <br/>\nlast week.  Then the books -- smaller kids one one side of the room -- older <br/>\nkids on the other.  Everyone wanders back and forth but it is well-organized. <br/>\n The librarians do not check out books.  That is done downstairs on the way <br/>\nout -- for yourself if you don&#39;t want to wait for a librarian to do it.  So <br/>\nthe librarians and aides (3-4 I&#39;m guessing) are available to help and answer <br/>\nquestions.  They also have speakers come in -- magician, bat lecture, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a really nice set up and all on line too if you want to check on <br/>\nanything.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they are very nice to hsers.
