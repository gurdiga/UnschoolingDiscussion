This was said in a condescending tone in front of his 12 year old daughter who LOVES Harry Potter. I quizzed him on it and he backed down but then my MIL spoke up saying she saw a 12 yr old boy at the library who had actually dared to wear a cloak and carry a wand out in public. She had this look of disgust on her face as she said this. I said I thought it was wonderful that he could get so excited by something and have the confidence to be himself. Would it be better if he was dressed exactly like everyone else because he was afraid of being different? She shut up then!<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought about it later  and wondered if they have forgotten what it was like to be children and if their entire childhood was spent just trying to blend in and be like everyone else. I also realized that if that same conversation had taken place a year or so ago I wouldn&#39;t have said anything. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can see that they will want less and less to do with us as our kids get older and stop being little and cute and continue to do &#39;strange things&#39; like wear capes! Which suits me fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nI love seeing my kids unafraid to be kids. I love having fun with them! Even if it means being a bit silly. <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76263,"nextTopicId":76127}}
