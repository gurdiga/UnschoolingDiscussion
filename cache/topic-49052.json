My husband and<br/>\nI have become involved with a group of parents who<br/>\nhave had children in the NICU at St. John&#39;s Mercy in<br/>\nSt. Louis, Missouri. Our Jakob was born at 24weeks<br/>\ngestation (1lb. 10oz) and was at St. John&#39;s for a long<br/>\nwhile. By the time we left, we had become very<br/>\nattached to the hospital and the NICU. We decided to<br/>\nget involved with this group to help other families<br/>\nwho are going through a crisis such as ours. <br/>\nBelow is a form for our annual fundraiser (of which I<br/>\nam in charge!), &quot;Letters From Santa&quot;. Please check it<br/>\nout and see if it is something you are interested in<br/>\nsharing with your little ones. We are trying to boost<br/>\nour efforts this year, so please forward this to<br/>\nanyone who you think might be interested (co-workers,<br/>\nfriends, relatives, etc).<br/>\nThanks in advance for your support.<br/>\nScout Gibson<br/>\nMom to Jakob Roar 12/00<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLetters from Santa!<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine the delight in your children�s eyes when they<br/>\nreceive a letter from Santa Claus. What better way to<br/>\nspread Christmas joy than to give your child a<br/>\nfriendly surprise or tell a friend or relative you are<br/>\nthinking about them? With just a little information<br/>\nfrom you, the St. John�s Mercy NICUPs will send your<br/>\nloved ones a personalized letter from Santa. Get a<br/>\njump-start on Christmas by requesting your letters<br/>\nearly!<br/>\n<br/>\nWho are the NICUPs? We are a group of graduate parents<br/>\nfrom the St. John�s Mercy Medical Center Neonatal<br/>\nIntensive Care Unit who provide support for families<br/>\nwith babies in the NICU. Having a child in the NICU is<br/>\nan overwhelming emotional crisis for families to<br/>\nendure and we offer support during this difficult<br/>\ntime. In the past, we have used the proceeds from our<br/>\nannual fundraiser to provide new furniture for the<br/>\nparent waiting areas and toys to occupy siblings while<br/>\nvisiting the unit. This year, we hope to receive<br/>\nenough donations to purchase new Medela breast pumps<br/>\nfor the NICU. Breastfeeding is imperative to the<br/>\nhealth of these small infants because it provides the<br/>\nnecessary antibodies and nutrients that they are<br/>\nmissing by being born too early. We currently have a<br/>\nshortage of pumps available for our mothers to use<br/>\nwhile in the unit. Our goal is to make the pumps<br/>\nreadily available so that we may encourage more moms<br/>\nto provide this source of nutrition for their babies<br/>\nwhile establishing a stronger connection with their<br/>\nchild. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we are expanding the services we hope to<br/>\nperform this year, we are asking for extra help from<br/>\nyou this season. Please circulate our forms to any<br/>\nfriends, family, or co-workers who may want their own<br/>\nletters from Santa.
