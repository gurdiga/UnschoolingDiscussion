(Be","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-101769356\">=My son, River Spirit, 13, who has had a declared hatred of writing<br/>\n*anything* since the beginning of time, has just informed me that he is<br/>\nwriting a book. (Be still my heart!!!!!)  His book, currently titled, &quot;A<br/>\nWarrior Reborn&quot;  is about three people from a lost civilization: a chef,<br/>\na teenage Royal Guard, and a retired gladiator.  There are also several<br/>\nsubcharacters in this adventure story.   He says he has written 44 pages<br/>\nof the first chapter and is also using digital images (created with Lego<br/>\npeople) to illustrate it.=<br/>\n<br/>\n= That is very cool! And what  great idea to illustrate it that way. I&#39;ll<br/>\nhave<br/>\n to tell my son about that. His internal world of characters and conflicts<br/>\n revolves around the Lego guys and he&#39;s always telling stories about them.<br/>\n He&#39;d love to make a visual story about them that way.=<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older son Noah (5 1/2) has been spending a lot of time lately creating<br/>\nwhat he refers to as &quot;My Star Wars Lego Movie&quot;. He&#39;s seen all 5 Star Wars<br/>\nmovies (impatiently awaiting the next one - anyone know when it&#39;s supposed<br/>\nto come out??) and has created a lot of fairly complex ships, etc. He has<br/>\nmade up a bunch of new characters as well (including &quot;Bad&quot; versions of most<br/>\nof the main characters -e.g. &quot;Bad&quot; Han Solo -that have all gone to the Dark<br/>\nSide) and a plot which continues to unfold, with new bits and pieces added<br/>\nalmost daily. He hasn&#39;t expressed any interest in trying to record any of<br/>\nthis so far, I think I&#39;ll ask him if he wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67544,"nextTopicId":66940}}
