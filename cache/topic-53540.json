For example, I have definite<br/>\nlimits (still) on letting my kids watch many rated R movies and in general,<br/>\nviewing sexually explicit scenes or material. That&#39;s probably more to do<br/>\nwith how I was raised than anything else, more to do with my own hangups. I<br/>\nsuspect that as the kids get older, though, we&#39;ll be letting go of limits on<br/>\nrated R movies and other things we still have limits on.

Mostly he likes games where you <br/>\nhave to shoot someone. I must admit that he&#39;s accurate as shit!! Kind of <br/>\nscary I guess to some! About 2 years ago him and my husband played one game <br/>\nI think about a hitman. My son ended up beating the game twice before my <br/>\nhusband did! After he wins he loses interest and moves on. Our 7 year old <br/>\ndaugher likes the sporting games best and loves to wrestle on the <br/>\nplaystation with her dad. She loves racing and soccer and stuff too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my husband brough home the one with the stealing cars and hookers, the <br/>\nkids just watched. They think it&#39;s funny.
