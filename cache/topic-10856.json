Firstly we only do presents for grown ups that are <br/>\npresent at Xmas where we live... So first the last couple of years it&#39;s been <br/>\nmum,dad,steve,me, my brother and fiancee and we put out names in a hat and we <br/>\nonly buy a gift for the name of the person we get.  This has cut down the <br/>\nspending drastically.  Plus we have a limit of $25 on each person.  (My new <br/>\nM.C. Beaton, murder mystery books come out at Xmas and I invariably get the <br/>\nnewest one then from someone).  I buy things periodically through the year, <br/>\nhoping to get someone that I can use the gift for.  Last year I got an $80 <br/>\nvalue book all about the History of England in the past 100 years for $8.00 <br/>\non clearance at Barnes and Noble.  Luckily I got my mother&#39;s name at Xmas and <br/>\nthat was her gift.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to have my dad build a computer desk for Zak this year and my <br/>\nbrother can buy the small chair for it.  I don&#39;t want any gifts for Max as <br/>\nhe&#39;s too young and has tons of his older brother&#39;s stuff that we are going to <br/>\nbox back up and give him.  He won&#39;t know the difference only being 1 at that <br/>\ntime (LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"burkfamily@aol.com","from":"burkfamily@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"TDSV9vyMWpaaDiDIWNa_5FmDcwyeDRDlPnLeGqXHIK6MfhnWE6Vjr6cje34hNBkD745UBD0LiENK","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: toys (Christmas in July)","postDate":"963067624","msgId":10856,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxLjZiZDRhYjYuMjY5ODk4ZThAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":10859,"prevInTime":10855,"nextInTime":10857,"topicId":10856,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Julie wrote: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-374498206\">Julie wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; This year we are putting together a Christmas <br/>\n wish list for everyone.
