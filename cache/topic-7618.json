We began <br/>\nhomeschooling last August, and I started out doing school at home and being <br/>\nway too structured.  Everyone was upset and tense.  Fortunately, with a great <br/>\ndeal of help from our support teacher at Clonlara, we have evolved into an <br/>\neclectic/bordering on unschooling approach.  Wonderful things are happening, <br/>\nand we are all much happier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always been an unschooler at heart, I suppose, but as a teacher was <br/>\ntoo entrenched in mainstream educational thinking.
