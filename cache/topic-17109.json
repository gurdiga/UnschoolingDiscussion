Nice to meet you and all that jazz. :)<br/>\nI understand the mild opposition thing, cuz even my<br/>\nfamily that is all for &quot;homeschooling&quot; has a hard time<br/>\nwith this whole unschooling thing, even though I was<br/>\nunschooled for most of my life, just not officially or<br/>\nknowingly. They want to see the kids DOING something<br/>\nfor &quot;schoolwork&quot; or soemthing.  I&#39;d like to think of<br/>\nmyself as a fairly intelligent/successful person and I<br/>\nleft ps in the middle of 3rd grade and went to a very<br/>\nsmall private school (where my mom was my teacher for<br/>\n5th grade) until the end of 5th. from then we bought a<br/>\ncuriculum (which wasn&#39;t used...except the cool paper<br/>\nthey sent. and the pencils.&lt;g&gt;)and another one for<br/>\nhigh school (which wasn&#39;t used. I&#39;m just not that kind<br/>\nof gal. I guess I never was.) While I can&#39;t say that I<br/>\nam what SOME people would consider a &quot;success story&quot; I<br/>\nwould like to share that I was alot like you say your<br/>\ndaughter is and I would get fired up about something<br/>\nbut it would be shortlived, and I would be interested<br/>\nin something else before I was done with the first<br/>\ninterest. (Some might think it&#39;s due to being<br/>\nGemini.)Dolphins I was always interested in. Never<br/>\nfailed, but rarely finished a project related to them.<br/>\nIt was the projects, though, not the subject, that I<br/>\nlost interest in. But as an adult, I feel am a<br/>\n&quot;success&quot;, in that I am totally free to be myself, to<br/>\nlearn what I want..( I think I&#39;m still unschooling<br/>\nmyself, actually)..when I want (provided the kids are<br/>\ncompliant)...and my older sister who GRADUATED from ps<br/>\nasks me when she can&#39;t figure out something that they<br/>\naverage observer would think &quot;oh, she didn&#39;t go to<br/>\nschool, she won&#39;t know that.&quot;  I was bored off and on<br/>\nalot...but my mom was super creative and would just<br/>\ntell us (me and 2yrs younger sis) things to PLAY, and<br/>\nI think we learned alot in that proccess. Also my<br/>\nparents tried to do the classes thing for me<br/>\ntoo...well, I wanted it too, sometimes, and I would<br/>\ngo...I can&#39;t even tell you how many &quot;introductory<br/>\nclasses&quot; I went to and decided never to go back. They<br/>\nwere nice enough people, but the whole idea of it<br/>\nbeing a &quot;class&quot; I think just made me almost nausious<br/>\nfrom anxiety. My sis on the other hand took the same<br/>\ngymnastics thing I did and stuck with it and did<br/>\nrecitals at the mall, etc. While I was free to sit and<br/>\nobserve. I think that part about it being ok for me to<br/>\nnot be interested in those things was truly good for<br/>\nme. My mom was always concerned (cuz she a mom and<br/>\nthat&#39;s what moms do)but she also knew she couldn&#39;t<br/>\nMAKE me do anything I didn&#39;t want to with a clean<br/>\nconscience. My point about it being good for me is<br/>\nthat now and thru my teen years, from all that sitting<br/>\nand observing other people mostly,with the occasional<br/>\nparticipation on my part, was actually TEACHING me. I<br/>\nwas very interested in psychology when I was 15 and<br/>\nsince I had the tremendous love of reading (the MOST<br/>\nimportant thing to teach a child, IMO, cuz with that<br/>\nthey can learn anything) I studied and read alot on<br/>\nthe subject. It enabled me to see into other people<br/>\nbetter and empathetically feel what they might be<br/>\nfeeling. As a result of that I am a pretty good<br/>\nlistener, and more to the &quot;success&quot; point - writer. My<br/>\nfriends and family have been trying to get me to<br/>\nfinish a novel since I was 16, and to tell the truth,<br/>\nI&#39;ve read some of the stuff people BUY out there and I<br/>\nprobably could do really well, if I wanted to pursue<br/>\nit. I think the things about me that I count as a<br/>\nsuccess are things that directly resulted from me<br/>\nbeing a wishy washy many interests frequently bored<br/>\nsort of kid who was &quot;taught&quot; at home and allowed<br/>\nfreedom to do what I felt, even if other people looked<br/>\ndown upon that. A feeling of loving protection flowing<br/>\nfrom my parents was what I felt when I knew or heard<br/>\nthem getting a hard time about me and defending me and<br/>\ntheir parenting. le sigh. Your dd will be<br/>\nfine...probably better than fine, even....who knows<br/>\nwhat kind of a HUGE success she&#39;ll be when she&#39;s older<br/>\nand say &quot;Thanks mom, for having faith in me.&quot;<br/>\nMAYBE her success will be that she will unschool her<br/>\nown kids and know what they&#39;re going through and be<br/>\nable to defend them and her mothering/teaching skills<br/>\nwell, having seen you do it yourself in her younger<br/>\nyears. <br/>\n-Bobbie<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:2learning@...\">2learning@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hello <br/>\n&gt; I am in Rhode Island and have 2 terrific daughters<br/>\n&gt; (8 and 5) and we <br/>\n&gt; have been officially unschooling since Jan.
