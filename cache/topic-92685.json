I thought you said you weren&#39;t. So <br/>\nyou are killing to feed your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an aquaintance whose family hunts. They think the meat in <br/>\nstores is unhealthy, full of hormones and all (I agree), and they <br/>\nsave a LOT of money by hunting. They spend time as a family, doing <br/>\nwhat they love...it&#39;s one way they save money so that the mother can <br/>\nbe home with the children and homeschool. They are one of the <br/>\nhealthiest families I know, both physically and emotionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Grandparents were farmers, mostly beef. They had healthy, free <br/>\nrange animals and lived a hard working and enjoyable life together. <br/>\nGrandpa is almost 90 and doing well for his age...still helping in <br/>\nthe garden, puttering with his Model &quot;T&quot; and caring for their large <br/>\nproperty. He owned guns his whole life and manages to raise a son <br/>\n(my Dad) that can&#39;t stand hunting, preferring to shoot animals with <br/>\na camera instead. How&#39;d that happen?<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t hunt myself. The only thing animal based that I eat is <br/>\nhoney and an occasional egg. But I think your arguements are hollow, <br/>\nfearful and completely insane.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92682,"nextTopicId":92688}}
