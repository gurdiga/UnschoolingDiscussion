I just thought some of you might like to <br/>\nrespond to <br/>\nAmazon.com.  So here it goes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Dear Friends,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you everyone for your thoughts and interest in working on the<br/>\nMichael & Debi Pearl problem.  I have just finished their main <br/>\nbook, &quot;To<br/>\nTrain Up a Child.&quot;  It is the most evil, sickening book about<br/>\nchild-raising I have ever read.  And all justified with Proverbs <br/>\nverses.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout the book, the Pearls recommend whipping *infants* and young<br/>\nchildren on their bare skin.  They do this for &quot;obedience training,&quot; <br/>\nand<br/>\ncompare it to training a dog or mule to obtain &quot;instant, unquestioning<br/>\nobedience.&quot;  They say ALL children need to be whipped with a &quot;rod.&quot;<br/>\nThey call babies &quot;tyrants&quot; &quot;terrorists&quot; &quot;whining, spoiled brats&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;devious&quot;, with &quot;criminal minds.&quot;  According to the Pearls, babies are<br/>\ndetermined to make parents&#39; lives &quot;as miserable as possible.&quot;  And the<br/>\nPearls decry the &quot;extraordinary ignorance of modern psychology.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis book is being sold at Amazon.com.  Amazon removed Home School<br/>\nDigest after we complained; let&#39;s try to do the same with &quot;To Raise <br/>\nUp a<br/>\nChild!&quot;  Please take a moment to write a review of this book at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/flex-sign-in/ref=cm_rev_write_2/104-\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/flex-sign-in/ref=cm_rev_write_2/104-</a><br/>\n118564<br/>\n3-0904763?page=community/community-sign-in-<br/>\nsecure.html&response=tg/stores/de<br/>\ntail/-/books/1892112000/customer-review-form&method=GET&return-url-<br/>\ncode=4&fr<br/>\nom-url-code=6&store=books<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some talking points:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The Pearls recommend whipping infants only a few months old on <br/>\ntheir<br/>\nbare skin.  They whip their own 4 month old (p.9).  They recommend<br/>\nwhipping the bare skin of &quot;every child&quot; (p.2) for &quot;Christians and<br/>\nnon-Christians&quot; (p.5) and for &quot;every transgression&quot; (p.1).  Parents <br/>\nwho<br/>\ndon&#39;t whip their babies into complete submission are portrayed as<br/>\nindifferemt, lazy, careless and neglectful (p.19) and are &quot;creating a<br/>\nNazi&quot; (p.45).<br/>\n<br/>\n2) On p.60 they recommend whipping babies who cannot sleep and are<br/>\ncrying, and to never allow them &quot;to get up.&quot;  On p.61 they recommend<br/>\nwhipping a 12 month old girl for crying.  On p.79 they recommend<br/>\nwhipping a 7 month old for screaming.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) On p.65 co-author Debi Pearl whips the bare leg of a 15 month old <br/>\nshe<br/>\nis babysitting, 10 separate times, for not playing with something she<br/>\ntells him to play with.  On p.56 Debi Pearl hits a 2 your old so <br/>\nhard &quot;a<br/>\nkarate chop like wheeze came from somewhere deep inside&quot; him.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) On p.59 they recommend whipping a 3 year old until he is &quot;totally<br/>\nbroken.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n5) On p.44 they say not to let the child&#39;s crying while being hit to<br/>\n&quot;cause you to lighten up on the intensity or duration of the <br/>\nspanking.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n6) On p.55 the Pearls say a mother should hit her child if he cries <br/>\nfor her.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) On p.80 they recommend giving a child having a tantrum &quot;a swift<br/>\n*forceful* spanking.&quot;  On the same page they say to whip small <br/>\nchildren<br/>\non their bare skin until they stop screaming.  &quot;Don&#39;t be bullied.  <br/>\nGive<br/>\nhim more of the same.&quot;  They say to continue whipping until their <br/>\ncrying<br/>\nturns into a &quot;wounded, submissive whimper.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n8) On p.46 the Pearls say that if a child does obey before being<br/>\nwhipped, whip them anyway.  And &quot;if you have to sit on him to spank <br/>\nhim,<br/>\nthen do not hesitate.  And hold him there until he is surrendered.<br/>\nProve that you are bigger, tougher.&quot;  &quot;Defeat him totally.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n9) On p.47 they recommend their various whips, including &quot;a belt or<br/>\nlarger tree branch&quot; to hit children.<br/>\n<br/>\n10) The Pearls also recommend ignoring an infant&#39;s bumped head when he<br/>\nfalls to the floor, and ignoring skinned knees (p.86).  They also say<br/>\n&quot;if your child is roughed-up by peers, rejoice.&quot; (p.81)<br/>\n<br/>\n11) They recommend pulling a nursing infant&#39;s hair (p.7), tripping a<br/>\nnon-swimming toddler so she falls into deep water (p.67) and to make<br/>\nchildren go hungry if they don&#39;t &quot;like what is on the table&quot; (p.103).<br/>\nAlso on p.103 they say that if children lose their shoes, &quot;let them go<br/>\nwithout until they (the children) can make the money to buy more.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Pearls&#39; methods have resulted in parents being investigated by <br/>\nChild<br/>\nProtective Services, and even a babysitter going to jail - see Amazon<br/>\nreviews #13, 29, 43, 48, & 74:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-</a><br/>\n/1892112000/ref=cm_rev_prev/104<br/>\n-1185643-0904763?v=glance&s=books&vi=customer-reviews&show=-<br/>\nsubmittime&start<br/>\n-at=11<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease write a review!  Here&#39;s the link for adding your review to<br/>\nAmazon:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/flex-sign-in/ref=cm_rev_write_2/104-\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/flex-sign-in/ref=cm_rev_write_2/104-</a><br/>\n118564<br/>\n3-0904763?opt=n&page=community/review-sign-in-<br/>\nsecure.html&response=tg/stores<br/>\n/detail/-/books/1892112000/customer-review-form&method=GET&cont-<br/>\npage=cm/sign<br/>\ned-in-continue&cont-type=add-rev&return-url-code=4&from-url-<br/>\ncode=6&st=books&<br/>\nme=ATVPDKIKX0DER&vi=customer-review-form<br/>\n  Citing some of the above references will make your review more<br/>\npowerful.  And the whole book can be read on-line at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://city.hokkai.or.jp/~repent/EnglishPages/TrainUp.html\">http://city.hokkai.or.jp/~repent/EnglishPages/TrainUp.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGetting this horrid &quot;rod&quot;
