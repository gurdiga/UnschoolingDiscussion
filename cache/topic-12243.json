I have battled back and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1808278259\">Thank you Kim and everyone for all your input on bedtimes, computer use and <br/>\nmath...I find all your input very helpful and supportive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have battled back and forth around structure vs. unstructured <br/>\nhomeschooling since my ds were 8 and 6 yo (now 13 and 11). I know the best <br/>\nadvice for me is JUST RELAX. Part of it is all the old &quot;shoulds&quot; that we <br/>\nlearned in school. I believe the other part of it is that I feel kinda LOST. <br/>\nWithout the structure of the curriculum and all its requirements and demands <br/>\nto push...when we let go of it...the girls go off and play and I feel as if, <br/>\nafter all these years of being so involved with them, that I am rather <br/>\nstunned. Like, what do I do now? And what did I used to be interested in? I <br/>\nguess I keep checking to see if it is really okay for me to take time to <br/>\nfocus more on my own interests again (whatever they are...). Kind of like <br/>\nthe empty-nest thing, I guess. The girls are busy all the time. They read <br/>\nalot, work on the computer, play with their animals, do role-playing dramas, <br/>\nplay piano, play ball, do some chores, cook and bake, and on and  on. I know <br/>\nthat their resistance to the curriculum stuff we have around is due to their <br/>\npresent healing from the structured approach we took last year where we had <br/>\nthem do some math, history, english, science, writing, etc. 4 days per week. <br/>\nNow that we have once again let go of the &quot;program&quot; they are thrilled to <br/>\nhave the weekly assignments stuff &quot;off their backs&quot;. We had included <br/>\nsoftware in typing and Spanish in their curriculums as well and now I see <br/>\nthat they are also staying away from that. Even the encarta program that <br/>\nthey liked hasn&#39;t been touched. I think anything you &quot;require&quot; turns into a <br/>\n&quot;no fun&quot; thing, so when the requirements are lifted, they still have a &quot;bad <br/>\ntaste&quot; over it.<br/>\nIt will all balance out over time, I bet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to get over this idea that I need to be &quot;on-call&quot; and always <br/>\navailable for them. For the last 13 years, I have been &quot;right there&quot;. I DO <br/>\nneed to RELAX and start doing my OWN unschooling. Maybe it will take me <br/>\nawhile too, to find my way. I have been doing some structured educating with <br/>\nthem (off and on) for about 5 years and living a very structured mom&#39;s life <br/>\nfor 13 years. I think I have kind of lost myself...or maybe I am learning <br/>\nfrom them for the first time in my life, how to &quot;lighten up&quot; and I want to <br/>\nfeel that same joy that they demonstrate in following one&#39;s bliss. I ache <br/>\nfor that and yet I don&#39;t know how to get there yet.<br/>\nwhen they are off playing all day now...and glad to be free of the &quot;push&quot;, <br/>\nhow can I &quot;do my thing&quot; and yet still be a &quot;good&quot; mom and be available for <br/>\nthem. I guess my fear is that I am afraid I will somehow &quot;not do it <br/>\nRIGHT&quot;...like I am using unschooling to get out of doing a &quot;good&quot; job at <br/>\nteaching my girls...I start fearing that I am slouching on the job if I am <br/>\nover here having my own fine time and they are &quot;just playing&quot; instead of <br/>\n&quot;learning what they are SUPPOSED to be learning. WHEW!!! You can tell I have <br/>\nbeen WELL PROGRAMMED, huh? My heart says FREEDOM; my mind is at WAR and full <br/>\nof judgement when we do not have STUCTURE and CONTROL.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to paste RELAX AND TRUST on my forehead, both for my ds AND for me <br/>\nand my process too. And I really need your support right now too...so thank <br/>\nyou.
