It has often been observed that &quot;verbal data&quot; has been passed on with vital pieces missing or with false interpretations, prejudices or misunderstandings, and this has only served to distort the subject from its original intention, making it seem conflicting, incomprehensible or unusable.  Since Scientology&#39;s only goal is to help people, they only want to ensure info is passed on correctly without alteration so that people can benefit from it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you don&#39;t know much about religions, how do you know Scientology is like or unlike other religions?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I never said I knew if Scientology is like or unlike other religions.  I do feel though, that a religion should address the spirit or spiritual growth, and it&#39;s my belief that Scientology does this.  It has business-like aspects, of course, as it takes money and an entire administrative system to run a church, organization, courseroom, stock materials and staff, etc.  But I&#39;d say every religion has a business-aspect to it.  They do have a courseroom for study and Sunday Service in most churches.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJenW</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117187741,"authorName":"unolist@aol.com","from":"unolist@...","profile":"unolist","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Scientology and unschooling","postDate":"1050372429","msgId":64905,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVhLjM3ZDhmNjdmLjJiY2NjMzRkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":64902,"nextInTopic":64970,"prevInTime":64904,"nextInTime":64906,"topicId":64767,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/14/03 8:17:40 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ... this probably is not what you meant, but I have seen L Ron Hubbard books at the thrift","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-634501948\">In a message dated 4/14/03 8:17:40 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can people learn all about Scientology for free?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this probably is not what you meant, but I have seen L Ron Hubbard books at <br/>\nthe thrift store.....<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also picked up some Gideon&#39;s pocket bibles at the thrift store to keep <br/>\nin my car and my purse.
