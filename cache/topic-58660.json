If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or<br/>\nyou&#39;d like to find out more about how video games and life in general are<br/>\nfilled with learning, come join us! <br/>\nAs discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling<br/>\nis *not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed<br/>\nlearning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest<br/>\nin unschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you<br/>\nkeep in mind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in<br/>\nways designed to help each other become unschoolers or become better at<br/>\nunschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a<br/>\n&quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since many listmembers love a lively<br/>\ndebate and questioning beliefs to their foundations.~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122926724,"authorName":"Rachel Ann","from":"Rachel  Ann &lt;hindar@...&gt;","profile":"salixj","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Junk Food/TV","postDate":"1045235308","msgId":58697,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFNEQwNjZDLjAwMDAwMS4wMTM2MEBBbm9saWNrRmFtaWx5Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGIyaXY5YSs3MXM1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58694,"nextInTopic":58698,"prevInTime":58696,"nextInTime":58698,"topicId":58660,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was very unfocused, unorganized and a procrastinator all through my school\nlife and I was far from *unschooled*.

It has helped, but it has also harmed.  Now all his favorite <br/>\nprograms are recorded, so he can walk away and be assured that he <br/>\nwon&#39;t miss something, but now he has almost 30 hours of television <br/>\nrecorded (shows he has chosen for TiVo to save) and we have enabled a <br/>\nsystem which createds even more opportunity to watch television, <br/>\nbecause there is always something on that he likes.  Electronic <br/>\ndevices - good & bad.  Overall, though, I would say good.  It has <br/>\nallowed him to choose skiing over television. As for the reason he is <br/>\nunhappy when he gets away from the television, I believe it has to do <br/>\nwith the way he settles into a passive, one-dimensional mode, and <br/>\nthen coming back to action and multi-tasking takes some time, and the <br/>\ntransition time is the most miserable time.
