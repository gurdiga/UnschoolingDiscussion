They also seem to self-regulate what they<br/>\nwant to see or read, for instance my daughter will simply up and leave if<br/>\nthe movie we are watching is too much for her...my middle son will tell me<br/>\nif a book is too much for him and we&#39;ll stop reading it ...sometimes it&#39;s<br/>\nthe Hardy Boys he won&#39;t want and then he&#39;ll go ahead and watch something &quot;I&quot;<br/>\nthink  is scary...which leads us into lots of squealing (mostly me!) and<br/>\nsnuggling.  I think too as Tia said, a lot of it goes over their heads.<br/>\nThey really are not capable of understanding some of the more adult concepts<br/>\nbeing brought up.  But some of it gets us into many discussions on morality,<br/>\nother people&#39;s viewpoints and world events that we may not have entered into<br/>\nhad we not watched something &quot;age inappropriate&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle H<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Message: 13<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Date: Wed, 22 May 2002 21:30:44 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re: &quot;Fluff&quot; books/age appropriateness<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; on 5/22/02 8:55 PM, Tim Traaseth at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:timt@...\">timt@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I want to let my children choose what they learn, but are they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; always ready emotionally for whatever, whenever??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why do you think children would read something they aren&#39;t emotionally<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ready<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If he read Jurassic Park and found it upsetting do you think he&#39;d feel<br/>\n&gt; compelled for some reason to keep reading or to not skip over the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>upsetting<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; parts?
