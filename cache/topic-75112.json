Why","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1281522202\">Hello All Dear E-mail Friends,<br/>\n <br/>\nThis fall my children and I are walking in the Alzheimer&#39;s Memory <br/>\nWalk in Honor of my Grandfather (their Great-Grandfather). <br/>\nWhy are we doing this? Our dear papa has Alzheimer&#39;s (has had it for <br/>\na number of years), and we have learned first hand just how de-<br/>\nmoralizing, de-meaning and horrible, horrible this disease is!!<br/>\n <br/>\nWill your children remember you?  Will they remember all the fun <br/>\nthings you did together? If your parent (s) gets this disease they <br/>\nmay not!  My Grandfather was an awesome man! (Still is) I love him so <br/>\ndearly, he taught me so many things! He is still teaching me, <br/>\nteaching me patience, more love than I ever thought I would feel, and <br/>\nhe taught me to fish : ) <br/>\n <br/>\nI am sending this to all on my e-mail list, so if your are not close <br/>\nenough to walk, then maybe you will send a donation, it&#39;s money to <br/>\nfind a cure! If you are close consider walking with us, send me an <br/>\nemail and I will give you send more info! If you wish to donate you <br/>\ncan send a check to :<br/>\n <br/>\nKCE Academy <br/>\n259 Mt. Auburn<br/>\nDunkirk, IN<br/>\n47336<br/>\n <br/>\nPlease make all checks out to Alzheimer&#39;s Association and date it for <br/>\nSept. 1 2003<br/>\n <br/>\nI thank you all so kindly and wish upon wish that you may never <br/>\nsuffer this disease with any one you know and love!<br/>\n <br/>\nTami Labig-Duquette<br/>\nP.s. Please let me know either way what you do, It&#39;s ok not to <br/>\ndonate, knowing we have you wishes and luck is GREAT!<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Time is a versatile performer. It Flies, marches on, heals all <br/>\nwounds, runs out and will tell&quot;<br/>\n~Franklin P. Jones</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75075,"nextTopicId":3627}}
