My daughter works on her signature because she has now had<br/>\noccasion to use it but handwriting eh? who really needs it much these<br/>\ndays...really?  Our six year old copies letters all the time though she can&#39;t<br/>\nread much at all.  Her sister never copied letters, hand writes poorly and<br/>\nreads years beyond her age. Handwriting is, in fact,  a great place to drive<br/>\neveryone totally nuts. Many a happy learner has been made miserable by well<br/>\nintentioned &quot;teachers&quot; putting pressure on them.   Leave it be.

My son&#39;s <br/>\nhandwriting is actually fine,  but he has some perfectionist tendencies <br/>\nand hates his writing.  He doesn&#39;t like to do a lot of writing,  but <br/>\nhe does write thank you letters, etc. on the computer.  He handwrites <br/>\nhis role-playing stuff but that doesn&#39;t seem to bother him because <br/>\nit&#39;s just for him.  I wonder if  learning  cursive may be outdated.  <br/>\nSome kids love it (my daughter did),  but if not, do they really need <br/>\nit.  Most of us eventually come up with our own print/cursive combo, <br/>\nand most writing other than some personal letters is now done on the<br/>\ncomputer. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane from KS<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1753,"nextTopicId":1839}}
