Check remedial reading supply sites.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I taught remedial reading one sad year long, long ago, we had a series <br/>\nof paperback books at second grade level (a formula involving sentence length <br/>\nand average word length), high school interest level.  They were good books!  <br/>\nScience fiction, cars, danger, adventure, plane crashes.  They would still <br/>\ntake a week to read, so the kids didn&#39;t have the impression of them being <br/>\neasy, and the stories were not shallow as to character, theme and all that <br/>\ngood analytical stuff.  I would read them aloud sometimes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne involved an emergency situation with a tourniquet.  Two non-reading 13 <br/>\nyear olds ditched school one day, played in an abandoned house, and one got <br/>\nbadly punctured with window class still in the frame.   The other took his <br/>\nshirt off, put pressure on the wound with part of it and made a tourniquet <br/>\nwith the other half, and they walked until they got a ride to the hospital, <br/>\njust a few blocks from there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe principal was really angry they&#39;d been ditching.  I was always really <br/>\nproud that they&#39;d used something they&#39;d learned in a remedial reading class <br/>\nin a real-life situation, which I thought beat the heck out of being in <br/>\nschool that afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll look and see if those books or their successors are still around.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40408,"nextTopicId":40423}}
