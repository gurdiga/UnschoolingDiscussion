In homechooling/unschooling circles this break is called <br/>\n&quot;deschooling&quot; and is always recommended. I&#39;ve heard the guideline of one <br/>\nmonth for every year of school. Like everything else of course, this is not <br/>\na rule, but a suggestion or guideline based on experience.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I am feeling very guilty for being so complacent for so many years.... and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;hope I can at least turn my youngest&#39;s life around.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>While you all deschool, you can also work on forgiving yourself. Lots of us <br/>\nhave felt the way you do. You&#39;ve done the best you could with the <br/>\ninformation you had.

I have not started any sort of <br/>\nschool or unschool at home as yet, unless one counts summer and just trying <br/>\nto relax, but I am not sending my 12 year old back to public school this <br/>\nfall.  After years of arguing with his father,  I have finally succeeded in <br/>\nat least having him agree to let me try it at home.  (divorce in progress <br/>\nhere)  Their father does not trust that I can handle the situation without a <br/>\n&quot;facilitator&quot; so I am probably going to sign up for a Charter School, and go <br/>\nfrom there, at least it is in a little different direction.  My son has <br/>\nlargely lost the joy of learning,  although I see him doing things this <br/>\nsummer that seem like learning to me...which I would never mention to him.  <br/>\nHe has never read for pleasure as a for instance.  Maybe that will come, <br/>\nmaybe it won&#39;t.  I really believe he needs a large break.  I am hoping with <br/>\nthis charter school that we may be able to choose a &quot;curriculum&quot; and do <br/>\nbasically what we want, yet documenting it in a way that appears to follow <br/>\nsaid curriculum.<br/>\nI have two older sons who went through the PS  system.  My seventeen year old <br/>\nis doing fine by most people standards, my twenty year old really would have <br/>\nbenefited from a completely different situation.  I am feeling very guilty <br/>\nfor being so complacent for so many years.... and hope I can at least turn my <br/>\nyoungest&#39;s life around.<br/>\nIdeally, I would like to do away with any kind of system at all. I believe <br/>\nsystems of all kinds are largely a mistake. <br/>\n I have enjoyed most of the posts on the list although some threads have <br/>\ngotten a bit tedious for me only because there  are an awful lot of posts to <br/>\nread through.  I am currently trying the digest version since I also belong <br/>\nto a number of other groups.  At least that way they are somewhat sorted.   I <br/>\nhave not been offended by anything.  Keep up the great posts.  I thank you <br/>\nall for the lively discussions.<br/>\nJessica</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40611,"nextTopicId":40617}}
