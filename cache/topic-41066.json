However I did complain about the<br/>\nPTO sending home a letter stating that our children had made wonderful<br/>\nlittle art creations and IF we wished to see them we must buy them from the<br/>\nPTO! (so lemme gets this straight?!?! you are selling ME my child&#39;s artwork,<br/>\nwhich I supplied the markers, paper, etc to make?!?!)  No thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, I am sorry for the school rant.  How does this pertain to unschooling?<br/>\nWell....hmmm...I am now able to spend the same money on FUN things for the<br/>\nkids, things they really want, and they get to wear what they want.<br/>\nZan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Tia Leschke<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On the news last night they did a report on the expense of &quot;back to<br/>\n&gt;school&quot; items.  Clothing and supplies ran an average of $250 per<br/>\n&gt;child.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s absurd.  One thing I never did when I had kids in school was to buy<br/>\na whole pile of new clothes at the start of the year.  One new outfit . . .<br/>\nmaybe.  They grow, for Pete&#39;s sake.  When they needed new clothes is when<br/>\nthey got them.  Well, maybe not new before their teens, but new to them.<br/>\nTia </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41082,"nextTopicId":41045}}
