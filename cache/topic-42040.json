I can identify with the having nothing in <br/>\ncommon thing.  My husband definately did not marry someone just like <br/>\nhis mother (a source of irritation for her).  As far as I can tell <br/>\nher interests are shopping and shopping and religion, superficially.  <br/>\nPart of my problem is that I haven&#39;t been prepared when she starts <br/>\nquestioning me.  My instinct is to tell her to just look at her son <br/>\nif she wants to know why I&#39;m unschooling.  But I don&#39;t want to hurt <br/>\nher or be combative.  I will be prepared next time thanks to the <br/>\nsupport here and closer to home (Hi Beth).<br/>\n<br/>\nCherry in GA  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., starsuncloud@c... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 8/26/02 8:29:56 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n&gt; Unschooling-dotcom@y... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; .
