My parents certainly did it.  We were left for the weekend <br/>\nwith a family that only spoke Spanish once.  They made us pick cucumbers.  My <br/>\nsister was crying.  A woman stayed at the house with us for a weekend.  She made <br/>\nus mop the kitchen floor on our hands and knees, with rags.   That was <br/>\nexciting.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce  left Kirby and Marty at a mom&#39;s day out program at the Methodist church <br/>\nnear us, so I could go Christmas shopping, I think it was.

I didn&#39;t use them<br/>\nmuch anyway except when I was a single parent.  I had to some then, but it<br/>\nwas for the kid who was the most comfortable being away from me, so that was<br/>\nall right.
