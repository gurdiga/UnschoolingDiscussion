The only way to go<br/>\nfrom here is more strict.  Well, I suppose I could leave the house<br/>\nentirely.  My role in this household is as the organizer.  I am the one<br/>\nwho knows where things are and when we are supposed to do things.  I take<br/>\ncare of the household so others can do their things freely.  My children<br/>\nhave very few rules other than that they are not allowed to pursue<br/>\ndestructive behavior.  That means something different for each child. <br/>\nJenni can hole up in her room for a week at a time and do whatever and<br/>\nthat is fine.  It is not fine if Rachel does it.  They are different<br/>\nchildren with different needs and problems.  The fact that I recognize<br/>\nthat allows the family to run smoothly.  The fact that you can&#39;t<br/>\nrecognize the fact that different children may need different things in<br/>\norder to unschool successfully is only going to push more people away<br/>\nfrom it, not draw us toward it.

My medical history is<br/>\nextensive.<br/>\nIn 1996 I had a bout of Guillaun-Barre.  I was down for about 6 months. <br/>\nIt was a very mild case, I never needed an iron lung or anything but it<br/>\nwas sever enough to keep me bedridden for better than three months,<br/>\nunable to lift a jug of milk for more than 6 months and just plain week<br/>\nfor a year.  That was during our first full year of homeschooling. <br/>\nRachel was 11, Jenni was 9 and Wyndham was 4.  The girls learned a lot<br/>\nthat year, like cooking and cleaning and caring for me!  Which was good<br/>\npractice for 1998.  In November of 1998 I was take by ambulance to the<br/>\nhospital where they diagnosed an acute asthma attack.  Unfortunately what<br/>\nthey should have diagnosed was a pulmonary embolism.  Had they done that<br/>\nthey may have prevented the heart attack I jad two days later when I was<br/>\ncoming out of the coma.  Several months later, my cardiologist tried to<br/>\nwithdraw my blood thinners.  I developed arterial clots in my legs within<br/>\nweeks.  So now I am on blood thinners for life.  It took a long time to<br/>\nrecover from the heart attack and I still have diminished fumction in my<br/>\nlower left ventrical and probably always will.  It is very unlikely to<br/>\nrecover more function this late after the event, or so they tell me.<br/>\nMeanwhile, I worked myself into a major depression last year and now am<br/>\nnot working because I need to be home for a while.  I understand the<br/>\neffects of stress and despite how you think I sound, I am not stressing<br/>\nover this conversation.  In fact, it has added a new joke to the Coffman<br/>\nrepertoire.  Now any time we see anyone being a parent - anything from<br/>\nstopping a toddler from running out into the road to telling a child he<br/>\nhas to leave the park and go home now - we say - oops, they can&#39;t be<br/>\nunschoolers!  Goes right along with our other joke - anyone showing a<br/>\nbelly button in public must be a slut.<br/>\nSo if nothing else, thanks for the new joke!<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~If electricity comes from electrons...does that mean that morality<br/>\ncomes from morons?~~~~<br/>\nI sent my Soul through the Invisible,<br/>\n        Some letter of that After-life to spell;<br/>\nAnd by and by my Soul returned to me,<br/>\n        And answered, &quot;I Myself am Heaven and Hell.&quot;  --  The Rubaiyat</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bridget E Coffman","from":"Bridget E Coffman &lt;rumpleteasermom@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"pn0cBGL9R2SBkqEhy1-xB56ZljQlqyBA0kpWRo1NHGksW_Ecu8L91kJ3EZjbthWQemHSkk4czi7oxouDXuB-Q8Ui76taBrhD3hO7tVtWruXnS3I","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Another Quote","postDate":"1000078924","msgId":24938,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwOTA5LjIxMjMxMi4tMTUxNDUxMS4yLnJ1bXBsZXRlYXNlcm1vbUBqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24935,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":24937,"nextInTime":24939,"topicId":24861,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you Bridget On Sun, 09 Sep 2001 14:37:24 -0400 Tami Labig-Duquette ... ~~~~If electricity comes from electrons...does that mean that morality comes","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1286231682\">Thank you<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sun, 09 Sep 2001 14:37:24 -0400 &quot;Tami Labig-Duquette&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:labigduquette@...\">labigduquette@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Bridget,<br/>\n&gt; Whether I agree with your unschooling or not is irrelevent, I doubt <br/>\n&gt; anyone <br/>\n&gt; would agree with mine and thats ok because I/We live for us in that <br/>\n&gt; respect <br/>\n&gt; :) I do admire your perseverence (sp?) in that you have stayed and <br/>\n&gt; not get <br/>\n&gt; nasty and then leave :) Also, I think you have brought up a great <br/>\n&gt; discussion, I have enjoyed reading this thread.<br/>\n&gt; Indiana Tami<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>~~~~If electricity comes from electrons...does that mean that morality<br/>\ncomes from morons?~~~~<br/>\nI sent my Soul through the Invisible,<br/>\n        Some letter of that After-life to spell;<br/>\nAnd by and by my Soul returned to me,<br/>\n        And answered, &quot;I Myself am Heaven and Hell.&quot;  --  The Rubaiyat</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sharon Rudd","from":"Sharon Rudd &lt;bearspawprint@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"WOG2WYCKCFnIl-_UTFPcpchTxlR9D0zHbM64T0QymQBuo-0bt6Qnif15n3mHpudT38FsKFikFCK5-N2E22yIaaY6VbUkWixJ3sjMnQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Another Quote","postDate":"1000061266","msgId":24865,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwOTA5MTg0NzQ2LjE0OTAucW1haWxAd2ViMTQzMDcubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDEwOTA5LjEzMzEwNy4tNzU0MjY1LjEzLnJ1bXBsZXRlYXNlcm1vbUBqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24862,"nextInTopic":24866,"prevInTime":24864,"nextInTime":24866,"topicId":24861,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Brigette....Are you running on adrenalin just now?
