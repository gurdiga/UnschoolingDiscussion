When he was born I was using a typewriter for my writing, <br/>\nand he<br/>\ngrew up during the development from manual to electric, then to <br/>\ncomputer<br/>\nkeyboards.<br/>\n<br/>\nBARBARA BLAKE-HANNAH<br/>\nI started using the original pre-Windows DOS computer with black <br/>\nscreen<br/>\nand green letters at about the time he learned to read. This meant <br/>\nthat<br/>\nthe combination of my lap as his favourite seat, and his eagerness <br/>\nto show<br/>\nthat he could read, enabled him to perform simple tasks on the <br/>\ncomputer<br/>\nlike open file, print, save, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though I soon acquired a computer with the first Windows 3.0<br/>\nprogramme, he has never forgotten the basic DOS operations that are <br/>\nthe<br/>\nfoundation of computer use, and this knowledge/education formed his<br/>\ndevelopment as a technology &#39;whiz kid&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was four years old, I moved to Kingston and began a PR job <br/>\nwith<br/>\nSPECS-SHANG Records manager Babsy Grange, who allowed me to bring my <br/>\nchild<br/>\nto the office. Taking advantage of this enlightened opportunity, he <br/>\nmade<br/>\nhimself useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was not bored by learning and helping to do such office tasks as<br/>\nprinting documents from the computer, sending faxes and even <br/>\nanswering the<br/>\nphone. His ability to read facilitated all these activities, and even<br/>\nthough he sometimes was a handful as children can be, he soon <br/>\nlearned how<br/>\nto behave by imitating the adults around him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis education was further enhanced and assisted by the Ramocan <br/>\nfamily, who<br/>\noperated an educational book distribution office next door and gave <br/>\nhim<br/>\nmany of the excellent Merrill school books which he read quietly in <br/>\nthe<br/>\ncorner that became his &#39;office&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing his great interest in the computer, I read about and sent to <br/>\nthe<br/>\nUSA for a fascinating &#39;toy&#39; named Socrates, a device that plugged <br/>\ninto the<br/>\nTV and connected by infra-red rays to a computer-like keyboard in the<br/>\nuser&#39;s lap.<br/>\n<br/>\nSocrates had game-like lessons in English grammar, spelling, maths,<br/>\ngeneral knowledge and even a place to make music. Socrates was as <br/>\nwise as<br/>\nits namesake, and taught my son not only knowledge, but fulfilled his<br/>\neagerness to use computers for learning and fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nFree to explore wherever he chose, he soon made Socrates, then later <br/>\nmy<br/>\ncomputer, his personal assistant and tutor. You know the rest of the<br/>\nstory, how he was appointed Youth Technology Consultant to the <br/>\nMinister of<br/>\nCommerce & Technology in 1998 at the age of 13. It all started with<br/>\nhomeschool - giving him the freedom to learn what he was most <br/>\ninterested<br/>\nin knowing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut &quot;homeschooling&quot; is not the correct term to describe the methods <br/>\nI used<br/>\nto educate my son. The large majority of homeschooling parents run a<br/>\nminature version of &#39;school&#39; in their homes, acquiring books and <br/>\nlesson<br/>\nplans of the regular curriculum, purchasing curriculum packages or <br/>\nusing<br/>\nthe Internet to access teaching websites.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a fixed daily schedule of &#39;lessons&#39;, and the ultimate goal <br/>\nis to<br/>\ncreate a child that is &#39;brighter&#39; at a younger age and passes high <br/>\nschool<br/>\nor university exams at a scholarship-winning level. Often this path <br/>\nleads<br/>\nto home-school &#39;burnout&#39;, where both parents and children buckle <br/>\nunder<br/>\nthis pressure and go back to traditional &#39;school.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nRather, &quot;un-schooling&quot; is the term more commonly used for the way I <br/>\ndid<br/>\nit. Un-schooling means allowing the child to learn what he wants, <br/>\nwhen he<br/>\nwants, in the way he wants, where he wants, for his own reasons. The<br/>\nmethod is learned-directed, and instead of a &#39;teacher&#39;, the parent <br/>\nacts as<br/>\na facilitator and resource person for the student.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Sounds impossible, doesn&#39;t it? The idea that children - even quite <br/>\nyoung<br/>\nchildren - should be in charge of their own education, choose what <br/>\nthey<br/>\nlearn and how they learn it, and even choose whether they should <br/>\nlearn<br/>\nanything at all sounds ludicrous,&quot; writes Mary Griffith in her <br/>\nexcellent<br/>\nbook, The Un-schooling Handbook - How To Use The Whole World As Your<br/>\nChild&#39;s Classroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nGriffith reminds us that the advent of what we know as &#39;school&#39; only<br/>\ndeveloped in the 1850s, and that formal education often lasted only <br/>\nthree<br/>\nto five years, the time it took to learn the basics of reading, <br/>\nwriting,<br/>\narithmetic and a smattering of history and literature. The rest of <br/>\nthe<br/>\nknowledge needed to become competent adults was acquired by working<br/>\nalongside adults, either family or as apprentices.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the 20th century, schools developed into the formal institutions <br/>\nwe<br/>\nknow and became regarded as a necessary instrument to teach children <br/>\na<br/>\ncurriculum and discipline for future employment in the modern <br/>\nmechanised<br/>\nworld.<br/>\n<br/>\nFew children acquired their education outside schools, but there were<br/>\nnotable exceptions. Margaret Mead, the famous American <br/>\nanthropologist and<br/>\nheroine who was unschooled, said: &quot;My grandmother wanted me to have <br/>\nan<br/>\neducation, so she kept me out of school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the 1970s, parents began to question the value of &#39;school&#39; as an<br/>\ninstrument of educational development. Led by the counter-culture <br/>\nmovement<br/>\nof that era, many parents opted to give their children an alternative<br/>\nupbringing and an education that fitted their concept of the global<br/>\nvillage. Homeschooling also found favour with parents who felt their<br/>\nreligious values were not being transmitted to their children within <br/>\nthe<br/>\nschool system.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome families come upon un-schooling while their children are still<br/>\ninfants and deliberately set out to create circumstances under which<br/>\nun-schooling can thrive.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers, like myself, develop similar ideas and practices accidentally<br/>\nwhile searching for a form of education that they feel will give <br/>\ntheir<br/>\nchild maximum intellectual possibilities. No two un-schooling <br/>\nfamilies are<br/>\nalike. However, they all have characteristics in common.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is crucial in un-schooling philosophy, says Griffith, is to <br/>\nknow that<br/>\nthe child has the desire to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above article is excerpted from Mrs Blake Hannah&#39;s book Home - <br/>\nThe<br/>\nFirst School, soon to be published by Jamaica Media Productions.
