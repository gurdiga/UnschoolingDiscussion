It seems like all the list I&#39;m on with large <br/>\ngroups of  Christian homeschoolers have post after post about their <br/>\nconferences and  the moderators don&#39;t seem to mind.  They talk at <br/>\nlength about the  speakers, last year&#39;s conference, where to meet each <br/>\nother and there are  lots of tips (don&#39;t bring the kids, don&#39;t buy <br/>\nanything the first day but  spend like crazy on the last).  <br/>\n <br/>\nAt this one, DODODO bring the kids!<br/>\n <br/>\nBring raffle donations the first day.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd buy raffle tickets all weekend! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Unschooling conferences are like some secret  get-together.
