My second son died from meningitis when he was<br/>\n12mos 22days old three years ago.  It is amazing how much I think about him<br/>\nand miss him everyday.  And I thank G*d that I had Connor to wake up to and<br/>\nhad a reason to get out of bed every morning.  I felt completely lost for<br/>\nthe longest time because I didn&#39;t have this little person running around<br/>\nsigning for &quot;more&quot;.  Now I have another little blessing running around<br/>\nsigning for &quot;more&quot;.  At the time, I felt like I had been robbed.  And now,<br/>\nwith Quinn, it&#39;s like I have been given back what was taken away from me<br/>\nthree years ago.  Babies are such blessings and create such a bright spot in<br/>\nour lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon Buckley<br/>\nMom to Connor 3-15-97, Carsten born at home 4-27-99/5-19-00 and Quinn born<br/>\nat home 8-08-02<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] *Me* time","postDate":"1060295461","msgId":78129,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDguM2FmNGFiYjMuMmM2NDJkMjVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":78130,"prevInTime":78128,"nextInTime":78130,"topicId":78129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/7/2003 6:01:11 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

I *could* spend that money <br/>\non a housekeeper or a WHOLE lot of chocolate or maybe a little less wine! &lt;G&gt; <br/>\nBut it&#39;s what keeps me up and loose and happy. I&#39;ve tried to forego it; I&#39;m <br/>\nmiserable. Going on weekly for eight years in December.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have older kids. And I never had two &#39;littluns&quot; at the same time (eight <br/>\nyears in between mine). Ben occasionally takes the boys camping or visiting <br/>\nhis mom for the weekend. So I get several days alone. I like to be by myself, <br/>\nso it&#39;s nice.  And he gets the boys without me. That&#39;s good for them too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as they get older, they *require* your presence less and less (not that <br/>\nthey don&#39;t NEED you! &lt;G&gt;), so enjoying what you&#39;ve got when you&#39;ve got it is a <br/>\nhealthy way to look at it. They&#39;ll soon want to do so much on their own--and <br/>\nyou&#39;ll get PLENTY of alone time *then*! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron&#39;s best friend died in a bus accident when they were five.
