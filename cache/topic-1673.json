I grew up listening to him on the radio<br/>\nand I still enjoy hearing him and his simple but powerful wisdom.<br/>\n<br/>\nDenise<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried so hard to make things better<br/>\nfor our kids that we made them<br/>\nworse. For my grandchildren,<br/>\nI&#39;d like better.<br/>\nI&#39;d really like for them to know about hand-me-down clothes,<br/>\nhomemade ice-cream and meat loaf<br/>\nsandwiches. I really would.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy cherished grandson,<br/>\nI hope you learn<br/>\nhumility by being humiliated, and that you learn<br/>\nhonesty by being cheated.<br/>\nI hope you learn to make your bed and mow the lawn<br/>\nand wash the car. And I<br/>\nreally hope nobody gives you a brand new car when<br/>\nyou are sixteen. I hope<br/>\nyou have a job by then.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be good if at least one time you can see a<br/>\nbaby calf born and your<br/>\nold dog put to sleep. I hope you get a black eye<br/>\nfighting for something you<br/>\nbelieve in. I hope you have to share a bedroom with<br/>\nyour younger brother.<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s all right if you have to draw a line down<br/>\nthe middle of the room,<br/>\nbut when he wants to crawl under the covers with you<br/>\nbecause he&#39;s scared, I<br/>\nhope you let him. When you want to see a Disney<br/>\nmovie and your little<br/>\nbrother wants to tag along, I hope you&#39;ll let him. I<br/>\nhope you have to walk<br/>\nuphill to school with your friends and that you live<br/>\nin a town where you can<br/>\ndo it safely.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn rainy days when you have to catch a ride I hope<br/>\nyour driver doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nto drop you two blocks away so you won&#39;t be seen<br/>\nriding with someone as<br/>\nuncool as your mom. If you want a slingshot, I hope<br/>\nyour dad teaches you to<br/>\nmake one instead of buying one. I hope you learn to<br/>\ndig in the dirt and read<br/>\nbooks. When you learn to use those newfangled<br/>\ncomputers, I hope you also<br/>\nlearn to add and subtract in your head. I hope you<br/>\nget razzed by your<br/>\nfriends when you have your first crush on a girl,<br/>\nand when you talk back to<br/>\nyour mother that you learn what Ivory soap taste<br/>\nlike.<br/>\n<br/>\nMay you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn<br/>\nyour hand on a stove and<br/>\nstick your tongue on a frozen flagpole. I hope you<br/>\nget sick when someone<br/>\nblows cigar smoke in your face. I don&#39;t care if you<br/>\ntry beer once, but I<br/>\nhope you don&#39;t like it. And if a friend offers you<br/>\ndope or a joint, I hope<br/>\nyou realize he&#39;s not your friend. I sure hope you<br/>\nmake time to sit on a<br/>\nporch with your grandpa and go fishing with your<br/>\nuncle.<br/>\n<br/>\nMay you feel sorrow at a funeral and the joy of<br/>\nholidays. I hope your mother<br/>\npunishes you when you throw a baseball through the<br/>\nneighbors window and<br/>\nthat she hugs you at Christmas time when you give<br/>\nher a plaster of Paris<br/>\nmold of your hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese things I wish for you - tough times and<br/>\ndisappointment, hard work and<br/>\nhappiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nWritten with a pen.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul Harvey<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1477,"nextTopicId":1674}}
