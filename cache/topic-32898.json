You","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1377652681\">I read in a book that it was King Solomon who advocated spanking.  His<br/>\nson grew up to be a harsh ruler who caused the kindom to divide because<br/>\nof it.  You don&#39;t find spanking any where else in the Bible.  In fact,<br/>\nJesus said not to rule over people but to serve everyone.  Also, even<br/>\nSolomon taught to use a rod, which was like a thin, flexible stick that<br/>\nholds mylar baloons at the store.  It is meant to sting, but cannot<br/>\nphysically harm the child like a bigger, rigid stick or a paddle.  Of<br/>\ncourse, there is no where it says you have to spank in the Bible.  I<br/>\nknow, I read it every day.  In fact, it seems to never really say an<br/>\nabsolute in the proverbs.  Proverbs is just a book of things to think<br/>\nabout, that usually apply abstractly to things in life.  For instance, it<br/>\nsays stripes of a friend are faithful- that&#39;s not literally true.  People<br/>\ndon&#39;t spank their friends, they use words to confront things that they<br/>\nsee as wrong.  So it&#39;s often figurative.  And the scripture about saving<br/>\nyour child from hell has to do with it&#39;s better for him to get a spanking<br/>\nnow for rebelling than to later become a criminal who kills and steals. <br/>\nThe idea of hell being the grave, or dying an early death due to wrong<br/>\nbehavior.  Of course, it also implies the idea of defying your parents<br/>\nand getting away with it may lead to defying God without remedy.  It says<br/>\nin the New Testament to not make your kids mad by provoking them, but<br/>\ninstead to instruct and correct them respectfully.  Also, in other places<br/>\nin the Bible, the rod implies the one shepherds used to guide their sheep<br/>\nto keep them from going over a cliff and as a visual aid so their sheep<br/>\nwould know where the shepherd was-not something to beat the sheep with. <br/>\nIn fact, other scriptures villify the shepherds who beat their sheep. <br/>\nThe New Testament teaches that we are no longer under the law, but under<br/>\ngrace.  We are no longer to be getting in trouble by God, but free to<br/>\nhave a relationship with God of love, forgiveness and acceptance.  That<br/>\nshould describe a Christian&#39;s relationship with one&#39;s children, since we<br/>\nare supposed to be examples to them of God&#39;s nature.
