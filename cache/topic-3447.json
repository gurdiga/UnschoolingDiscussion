I love Santa, it <br/>\nis fun, but hey, I was raised in a time when we had a haunted house in the <br/>\nbasement of our church.  Halloween was a time of fun and joy for the kids, <br/>\nand people weren&#39;t lecturing us that it was the celebration of Satan,  maybe <br/>\nin other countries it was, but it was never that intent here and as a child <br/>\nwe had such fun, dressing up and getting free candy, and roaming for hours <br/>\noutside, at night! by ourselves!  Can&#39;t do that today.  Wow, how did I get to <br/>\nHalloween from Christmas? LOL,  To get back to the point, Christmas for us is <br/>\na beautiful time, your family makes it what it is, and you do what you want.  <br/>\nI love the hustle and bustle, the carols and everything that goes with it.  <br/>\nHeck, my boys were born, Dec 3 and Dec 24.  We have a joint birthday party <br/>\nthe second weekend of Dec.  We have friends and family, at our home, the kids <br/>\nplay all day inside, outside, where ever.  The parents then have their party <br/>\nin the evening, and I usually end up with about 7or 8 little boys spending <br/>\nthe night and half the next day.  We just hang out, cook burgers on the <br/>\ngrill, order pizza the next day.  It is a fun time for all the families.  <br/>\nSorry, seems I am replying to everybody&#39;s posts on holidays and bday parties!<br/>\nTeresa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Monica L.
