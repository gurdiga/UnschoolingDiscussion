I love it that they are interested<br/>\nin all the seemingly little things that go on in our lives.  Today<br/>\nwe were headed down to the social security office to get our baby<br/>\na #(tax time is near:), and on the way our 8yo dd asked why we had<br/>\nto go there.  I told her the baby needs a ss #.  Then she asked if<br/>\nshe could get one too.  When I told her she had one, she was so <br/>\nexcited and wanted to what it was(hers personally and why a person<br/>\nneeded one in general).  I had printed the application off the <br/>\nss website, and in looking for it had discovered some fun facts<br/>\nabout ss #&#39;s and printed them off for dh and I to read.  We had<br/>\nbrought that all along w/us so I passed back the printouts for my<br/>\nkids to see and incredibly enough, they loved it!  One was the <br/>\nhistory of ss, one was about the most misused ss card in history, <br/>\nand then one was about wether or not you can tell where someone<br/>\nwas born based on their ss #.  All of it dh and I found interesting, <br/>\nso I shouldn&#39;t be surprised that the kids did too.  It&#39;s just<br/>\nreally *fun* to have your kids share your interest in something :)<br/>\nIt hasn&#39;t gotten old yet, and I&#39;m hoping it never does :) krista</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103360,"nextTopicId":103432}}
