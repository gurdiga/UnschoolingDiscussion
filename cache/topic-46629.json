Write all those<br/>\nthoughts down then connect them with our feelings and<br/>\nneeds. Also strive to connect with the feelings and<br/>\nneeds of the other person whose actions has triggered<br/>\nthe judgmental thoughts. (I find this easier to do<br/>\nafter I have connected to my feelings and needs first<br/>\notherwise I am not present enough to &quot;hear&quot; their pain<br/>\nor concerns) So I find my judgmental thoughts very<br/>\nhelpful. I strive to keep them to myself transalte<br/>\nthem to feelings and needs. I find if I stay in what I<br/>\ncall &quot;nice mode&quot; and stop my judgemental thougths<br/>\nbecause the things I thought are bad or wrong I am<br/>\nless likely to be able to connect to what my feelings<br/>\nare. (Guess what I am doing I am judging my judgemtnal<br/>\nthoughts ;) Then I am less likely to seek connection<br/>\nwith others.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested understanding more of NVC go to<br/>\ncnvc.org.
