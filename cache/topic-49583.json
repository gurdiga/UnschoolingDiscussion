The two most <br/>\navailable sources are the works of Shakespeare and the King james version of <br/>\nthe Bible. Of those two, the Bible is the easier to read and is closer to <br/>\neveryday speech and writing of the period. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t learn to use the phrases and vocabulary of the sixteenth and <br/>\nseventeenth centuries until you have a feel for how they do and do not fit <br/>\ntogether. You can use the &quot;thee&quot;s and &quot;thou&quot;s without the pain of conjugation <br/>\nand memorization by reading them until they sound natural. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some interesting passages which can be read painlessly and without <br/>\nfear of religious effect. The first number is the chapter, and the second is <br/>\nthe verse. There will probably be a list of the books in order in the <br/>\nbeginning of the Bible. <br/>\n<br/>\n*   Esther 2:12 (harems) <br/>\n*   Genesis 38:8-10 (birth control) <br/>\n*   Judges 20:16 (a left-handed army) <br/>\n*   Zechariah 5:1-2 (a flying roll) <br/>\n*   Genesis 38:27-30 (a great story about unborn twins, and one sticks his <br/>\nhand out. . .) <br/>\n*   Leviticus 11:30 (unclean creeping things) <br/>\n*   Isaiah 11:8 (cockatrices) <br/>\n*   Genesis 30:14-16 (sex for mandrakes) <br/>\n*   I Kings 16:9 (the captain is found drunk at the steward&#39;s house and the <br/>\nking does horrible things for several verses following. Read verse 11 for an <br/>\ninteresting description of male-persons.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a little more serious reading, try Genesis 27, the entire chapter. It&#39;s <br/>\nthe story of Jacob and Esau - disguise and intrigue. The chapters following <br/>\nthat are good, too (including the mandrake story recommended above, and a <br/>\ngenetics lesson).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you read a more modern version of the Bible you won&#39;t get the effect we&#39;re <br/>\nafter. Language like &quot;And the King said unto Haman, The silver is given to <br/>\nthee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee&quot; will be <br/>\nchanged to &quot;&#39;Keep the money,&#39; the king said to Haman, &#39;and do with the people <br/>\nas you please.&#39;&quot; (Esther 3:11, chosen at random, first King James and then <br/>\nNew International) <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t recommend using &quot;seemeth&quot; in everyday speech, but the word order can <br/>\nbe used with our own verbs and pronouns. &quot;Do with this as seems good to you&quot; <br/>\nsounds more formal and exotic than &quot;Do whatever you want to do with it.&quot; &quot;If <br/>\nI have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to <br/>\ngrant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to <br/>\nthe banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king <br/>\nhath said. Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart. . .&quot; <br/>\nSee? Even the verses that don&#39;t say anything weighty and wonderful can be <br/>\npretty. If you don&#39;t own a King James Bible, check a thrift store, used book <br/>\nstore, or ask an older protestant friend of yours if you can borrow one or <br/>\nhave an extra. The library may have one you can check out. Regular bookstores <br/>\nprobably have them, and most religious supply houses will have. Don&#39;t steal <br/>\none from a motel room if you can help it. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nFootnotes:<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n    [1] A word to the devout: Please don&#39;t be offended by my suggestion that <br/>\nit&#39;s possible to read lots of the Bible without finding much of religious <br/>\nvalue.
