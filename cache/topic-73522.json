They were all <br/>\ngreat, and I really enjoyed camping with them. Kirby and Marty, especially, <br/>\nwere always taking care of camp chores, usually without being asked.  They are <br/>\nreally great kids.  Holly, too, of course, she seemed to be having lots of fun, <br/>\nand was very self-sufficient.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEach kid had his or her own tent.  Kirby ended up sharing his with his 18 <br/>\nyear old cousin Gina and her best friend (female), so having two girls like that <br/>\nin his tent kept him from having any other kinds of girls in there.  That was <br/>\nokay. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the kids aren&#39;t clingy or scared, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nYes they are.

I hope nobody minds.<br/>\nMy son wanted to sign up for a week of swim camp this week because <br/>\nhis friend was doing it (as well as several cousins), so we visited <br/>\nand checked it out, and he wanted to give it a try.<br/>\nThis is a very popular local swim school that almost everyone&#39;s kids <br/>\ngo to at some point to learn how to swim (or learn how to hate it, <br/>\nbut that&#39;s a different topic).  My ten year old went when he was <br/>\nyounger and thoroughly enjoyed it, my eight year old tried it for <br/>\none day when he was four, hated it, and never went back.  My now <br/>\nfour year old (my youngest) actually already knows how to swim since <br/>\nwe have regular access to a pool, but he really wanted to try this <br/>\ncamp anyway, just for fun, and just for one week.  (Three hours of <br/>\nalternating swimming &quot;lessons&quot; and play in a large, attractive, well-<br/>\nstocked sandbox).  The first day he did fine, but the second day he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to go back.  Apparently he had an okay time but didn&#39;t <br/>\nrealize how much he&#39;d hate being left there &quot;alone&quot; (parents aren&#39;t <br/>\nallowed to stay).  I tried to take him the second day to see if <br/>\nthey&#39;d let me hang around for at least a little while he acclimated, <br/>\nbut they wouldn&#39;t let me stay, and he attached himself to me like <br/>\nglue, refusing to stay without me.<br/>\n  <br/>\nMeanwhile, there are some very young children (like just turned <br/>\nthree it looked like) *totally hysterical* because the camp <br/>\ncounsellors had peeled them off their moms while their moms jumped <br/>\nin their cars ignoring their crying, so my son was told &quot;it wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nbe fair for your mom to stay because then all the other little boys <br/>\nand girls will want *their* moms.&quot;  When I made it clear that I&#39;d <br/>\nmade a mistake and my son was leaving with me and wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nreturning I was told what a &quot;shame&quot; it was that I wouldn&#39;t let him <br/>\nadjust and &quot;have fun at camp.&quot;  They told me that I should at least <br/>\nmake him stay for three days before I &quot;give in.&quot;  I went through the <br/>\nsame shaming attempts from the director when I spoke to him about <br/>\ngetting a refund.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just feel really shitty... almost like I have an emotional hang-<br/>\nover from all the toxic input.
