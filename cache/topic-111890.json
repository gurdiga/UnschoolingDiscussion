But some of the words they<br/>\n&quot;know&quot; were combinations of English and Farsi and those are very<br/>\nprecious to us - my oldest used to have a &quot;khirs-bear&quot; - khirs is<br/>\nbear in Farsi, so that&#39;s really saying &quot;bear bear.&quot;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSweet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a friend in high school whose parents were linguists. They lived<br/>\nand studied in Africa when Colin was very little (toddler ages).<br/>\nLiving in a more remote area, none of the tribe spoke english. When<br/>\nColin and a wee tribe member became friends, they formed their own<br/>\npigeon language, a combination of English and whatever language that<br/>\nchild knew ( I don&#39;t remember).  Colin didn&#39;t use this language with<br/>\nanyone but that child. He instinctively knew that his parents spoke<br/>\nEnglish, the rest of the tribe spoke another language and this child<br/>\nand himself had their very own language.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe use Spanish words here and there. It&#39;s fun and sometimes it has<br/>\nmore impact than the English equivilent (when I say &quot;escuche!&quot;, Jalen<br/>\nis way more likely to listen to me).<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Problems with &quot;teach one word&quot;","postDate":"1139528769","msgId":111890,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRzZ2s4MStoYm50QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":111891,"prevInTime":111889,"nextInTime":111891,"topicId":111890,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m all for talking naturally around children and using real words , but there s absolutely no need to limit yourself .
