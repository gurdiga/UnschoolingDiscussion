Unschooling doesn t directly apply to braces (or eating habits or bedtimes), but once you start to think that children are both capable and entitled to ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-430517387\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; Here&#39;s a situation I&#39;d like to see how unschooling would apply.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling doesn&#39;t directly apply to braces (or eating habits or bedtimes),<br/>\nbut once you start to think that children are both capable and entitled to<br/>\ndirect their own education, that thinking tends to leak over into other<br/>\nareas of family life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your child needs braces, not because of major tooth misalignment, but<br/>\n&gt; because of a hidden jaw alignment that, if not corrected, will<br/>\n&gt; develop into TMJ in later life. His smile looks fine, his teeth are<br/>\n&gt; straight and white...but there is a flaw in his bite that will lead<br/>\n&gt; to health probs down the road. He doesn&#39;t want braces. He dislikes<br/>\n&gt; how they look on people and thinks they would be too painful, esp.<br/>\n&gt; when he can&#39;t see anything wrong with how he looks and no one is<br/>\n&gt; teasing him about crooked teeth.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you have him fitted with braces, anyway?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How certain is it that TMJ *will* develop later in life? Is it really that<br/>\npredictable, or is it &quot;can&quot; develop? How much later in life? His 20s? 40s?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it was an absolute this-will-happen-by-the-time-he&#39;s-22 vs. a<br/>\nthis-might-happen-when-he&#39;s-50 it would affect how urgently I would feel the<br/>\nneed to go against his stated wishes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, your child begins to find an interest in higher learning at<br/>\n&gt; about age 17...he is nearly at the end of his high school years<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>snip<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But lack of planning in his earlier years has left<br/>\n&gt; him with FEWER OPTIONS than he would have had, if there&#39;d been some<br/>\n&gt; structure and some pushing back there. A child may not know himself<br/>\n&gt; well enough to realize that formal education is something he wants to<br/>\n&gt; do...MAY not? I&#39;d venture, he WON&#39;T know himself well enough.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What say ye?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What if he discovered at 17 an urge to become an olympic gymnast? Oh no!<br/>\nLeft too late now, he&#39;ll never make it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if I discovered last year (at 35) that what I really wanted to do was<br/>\nbecome a steeplechase jockey? Whoops! Too late to start a career.<br/>\n<br/>\nCollege prep at 17 is a slam-dunk in comparison. Heck, college-prep at 35<br/>\nwould be  slam-dunk in comparison!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe could work his way through, as you said. He could do his college prep for<br/>\na year or two from home and then apply. He could attend junior college and<br/>\nget an AA degree and then transfer. He could try qualifying for scholarships<br/>\n(how many of those have an age limit? All scholarships? Some? What age?) He<br/>\ncould get military aid, or family help.<br/>\n<br/>\n17 is not the magic age where all humans must decide what they are going to<br/>\ndo for the rest of their lives. If it were, I&#39;d be an accountant today.<br/>\nInstead, I&#39;ve been an accountant, dog trainer, and now bookseller. Sometime<br/>\nI might be something else for a career.
