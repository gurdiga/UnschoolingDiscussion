While not really a sweating work out, it was great for strengthening<br/>\nmy stomach muscles and getting rid of back pain.  It was challenging, and I<br/>\nliked the calm scenes and low-key instruction.  Problem is my VCR is broken<br/>\nand I can&#39;t seem to find it on DVD.  Probably isn&#39;t even being produced<br/>\nanymore.  It was several years ago that I used it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know how I can transfer a video tape to DVD.

I missed it the<br/>\nfirst<br/>\n&gt; time.  I was in your shoes, not too long ago.  I finally found a solution<br/>\n&gt; that works well for me. Maybe it&#39;ll work for you too.  (before this I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; into aerobics at all and I don&#39;t consider myself very coordinated)  I<br/>\n&gt; discovered Leslie Sansone Walk Aerobic tapes.  They are very basic using<br/>\n&gt; just four or five steps for the most part.  There are side steps, kicks,<br/>\n&gt; marching in place, kick backs, and knee lifts.  They are all low impact<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; still get me sweating.  Leslie is sweet but not sugary fake.  (get ready,<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; am going to sound like an infomercial now.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Over the last 14 or so months, I&#39;ve lost 30 lbs and increased my muscle<br/>\nmass<br/>\n&gt; substantially.  I no longer have an aching back and I look forward to<br/>\n&gt; exercising every day.  I&#39;ve not really dieted at all but I am trying to<br/>\nmake<br/>\n&gt; better choices more often and I try to eat fruits, whole grains,  and<br/>\n&gt; veggies every day.  I still eat a moderate amount of sweets, so I don&#39;t<br/>\nfeel<br/>\n&gt; like I am depriving myself.  My kids quickly got used to the fact that I<br/>\n&gt; exercise every morning.  They know that it is my *me* time.  I make sure<br/>\n&gt; they have something to eat and maybe a TV show to watch.  Sometimes they<br/>\n&gt; bring their barbies down and barbie exercises with me.  :0)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The tapes are only around $9 each at Walmart.  Often cheaper on ebay or<br/>\n&gt; half.com.  If you hate them, you can always re-sell them on half.com.  I<br/>\nam<br/>\n&gt; really enthusiastic about them because I had tried for years to find a way<br/>\n&gt; to keep in shape with small kids and a dh that travels.  It wasn&#39;t my lack<br/>\n&gt; of willingness that kept me out of shape.  I just hadn&#39;t found an activity<br/>\n&gt; that kept my interest that didn&#39;t kill me.  I tried the stationary bike,<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; treadmill, walking or running outside etc.  They either bored me or I<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t do them consistently because of the weather or the fact that dh<br/>\n&gt; travels a lot.  I had done other aerobic tapes in the past, but you had to<br/>\n&gt; be in great shape to begin with to even consider doing them.  Leslie works<br/>\n&gt; for beginners as well as fit people because you can easily tailor it to<br/>\nyour<br/>\n&gt; fitness level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (whew! all that enthusiasm is tiring!

We do all come in different shapes and<br/>\nsizes and as long as he is not obese and risking his<br/>\nhealth there is nothing wrong with being his own shape<br/>\nand size.  <br/>\n<br/>\n**********<br/>\n <br/>\nAt first (some 18 mos ago) I thought it was prep for a growth spurt.  My oldest son (19) was a stick-child, but just before a growth spurt he would gain just enought weight to look as if I actually fed him. &lt;g&gt; Then he would shoot up a few inches and be a stick yet again.   As an adult, he&#39;s 5&#39;10&quot; and only 120 lbs -- still a stick.  He was the kid who practically had to be force-fed<br/>\n <br/>\nAndy has always been &#39;solid&#39; compared to both the other boys -- his younger brother is just overall small for his age.  Yes, he will grow into his current weight in that he will someday be tall enough to weigh more than his current 100 lbs.  And yes, he will likely always be stocky.  I could see that even when he was toddler -- he&#39;s just a big kid, tho not overly tall.  Additionally, he has food issues around textures and eats no meat (another sensory issue) so his diet is very comfort-food oriented, which others see as an indulgence on my part.  It&#39;s easy for them to say it&#39;s my fault he&#39;s overweight.  My Mom&#39;s take on it is that I &#39;let this happen.&#39;  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;d much rather deal with this now than to have it sneak up on him in his 20&#39;s as happened to me and my sibs. Our diet was so totally controlled by Mom in our childhood that we rebelled in adulthood -- we were the young adults cruising the &#39;sugar-frosted sugar&#39; cereal aisle, and shunning all &#39;healthy&#39; food.  I guess since that happened after we left home, my Mom can feel that she didn&#39;t &#39;let it happen.&#39; I want Andy to find his own way to a relationship with food before adulthood, and to have a much better sense of self than I ever had.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat I dislike most about the whole thing is that people tell me he&#39;s overweight -- like they think we haven&#39;t noticed yet.  Sorta like they feel if I knew I&#39;d have already fixed it, or I&#39;d have him eating nothing but celery sticks as proof that I was taking care of it.<br/>\n <br/>\nSyl <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

I won&#39;t be swayed, so can&#39;t we find something pleasant to talk about?<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t feel any need to defend what we do, in that I know we&#39;re right.  For me it would be like wasting time arguing that grass is indeed green.  In myself, I really could not care less what they think -- as long as they don&#39;t share their thoughts with my kids.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI will make a pre-emptive strike with my Mom about Andy&#39;s weight.  We came down pretty hard on the inlaws after our last visit re: mil&#39;s comments about his weight so I&#39;m quite sure they won&#39;t say anything in front of Andy.  I realize they are all very genuinely concerned.  We just have different strategies. I hope mine are more successful than my Mom -- we all three ended up with weight, food and diet issues.<br/>\n <br/>\nNot having them visit isn&#39;t really an option, since the boys absolutely adore all their grandparents -- they even like my Dad.  I love the inlaws, they&#39;re good people and they&#39;ve been very good to us over the years.  Also, Gary is an only child, so keeping relationship with them is just part of the whole package.  We were both raised to be &#39;good&#39; children.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think we&#39;re just going to be ourselves, and they can like it or not.  If they say something inappropriate, I&#39;ll just cut them off ann make it clear in front of the kids where we stand.  The hell with graciousness.  From now on, I&#39;ll opt for honesty and integrity.  I&#39;m not going to compromise our kids, or ask them to compromise themselves, for anyone. <br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

We ve had a pretty close, but somewhat conflicted, relationship","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-419561012\">I just learned last Thursday that my Mom is moving back to town -- next weekend (the 31st).  We&#39;ve had a pretty close, but somewhat conflicted, relationship over  the years.  She&#39;s pretty much always lived near me, but for a few years and this past year.  She&#39;s usually pretty good about respecting our differences, tho there was a recent episode where she recommended spanking.  I think that was part of her depression and loneliness at being in NC, so I&#39;m pretty sure it won&#39;t come up again -- and I was very firm that I won&#39;t hit my kids.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, she&#39;s coming back, looking forward to spending time with me again and, I think, in a much better place emotionally.  She&#39;ll be house-sharing with a woman who&#39;s been her closest friend since I was a teenager, so they&#39;ve both been thru a lot together.  I&#39;m happy to have her nearby, in that I do enjoy her company and the boys love her.  BUT......<br/>\n <br/>\nSeveral times lately, she&#39;s offered (totally unsolicited, mind you) ways I can include specific learning into Andy&#39;s &#39;schooling.&#39;  I&#39;ve never bothered to explain the unschooling thing to her because a) she was in NC and b) it&#39;s not something I&#39;m going to change, so it&#39;s not really open for debate.  Okay, that&#39;s very much my style since childhood -- I do what I want, let them believe what they want and share my thoughts only on a need to know basis.  I also do a fair amount of tongue-biting, because the fight&#39;s just not worth it.<br/>\n <br/>\nAdd to that, the inl-aws will be here in just 10 short weeks (early Oct) and I&#39;m probably just days away from developing a nervous tic and dumping all my stress on poor Gary.  I&#39;ve already begun stressing over the housekeeping to be done before then -- if I start tomorrow I just might be done by the time they arrive.  Of course, they will arrive with expectations for what Andy &#39;should&#39; be learning.  My mil is very bothered that Andy still writes in all caps and often reverses the &#39;N.&#39;   <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd, of course, they&#39;ll be concerned about Andy&#39;s weight -- and no one will be quiet about that one.  With the in-laws it&#39;s about how we should sign Andy up for a regular activity - or that he&#39;d get regular exercise in school with PE and playground time -- even if it&#39;s not what Andy wants.  It&#39;s not like he&#39;s huge.  Neither of the doctors he&#39;s seen recently are concerned, his BMI is just slightly in the &#39;overweight&#39; range, and he&#39;s aware of it.  It breaks my heart to hear him, at age 8, saying he&#39;d like to be &#39;less fat&#39; and &#39;not so big.&#39;  <br/>\n <br/>\nReading this, I guess it&#39;s more about how I can stop my own worries now and get past the stress.  It&#39;s like constant warfare between the voices of my childhood -- what about school, he&#39;s too smart to not be writing, watch his weight now or he&#39;ll be fat forever, etc. and the rational, joyous truths I&#39;ve come to know in the last few years in my life with these children.  And it&#39;s the frustration that the only person who doesn&#39;t think I&#39;m misguided, too easy and naive is Gary.  I know it shouldn&#39;t matter to me what anyone outside our home thinks or wants, but the good daughter in me is feeling really battered right now.  And I don&#39;t want to spill over and dump on the guys.<br/>\n <br/>\nSyl, who just needed to vent, I guess.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Since her last departure, we&#39;ve embraced unschooling here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

My<br/>\ncousin rowed in the &#39;84 Olympics (took a silver) and I learned that our<br/>\nteams did the same workout.  Although I have a Concept II ergometer and some<br/>\nfree weights, some days I do these body circuits instead.  The workout<br/>\nroutine both of our teams did requires no equipment except a timer.

We did situps, pushups, jumpies, back<br/>\narches, bench pulls.  Currently I do situps, pushups, jumpies, back arches,<br/>\ntriceps dips, anything else I want to work on.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will do the exercise for 45 seconds, 15 seconds off, six times.  Take a<br/>\n2 minute break and switch to the next exercise.  You end up with 30-40<br/>\nminutes of fairly intense cardio.  Truly, at some point in the pushup<br/>\nsequence I often end up doing pushups against the wall, as it is pretty<br/>\nrigorous.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good part about these body circuits is I can do them any any room the kids<br/>\nare in (mine are all young) and it often leads to play and wrestling and kid<br/>\nfun.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have some spare money to invest, I highly recommend the Concept II.<br/>\nThe only exercise or sport that works more muscles and gives more of a<br/>\ncardio workout is cross-country skiing.

We have 5 kids (13, 11, 7, 5 and 4).  I also was<br/>\n&gt; so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; desperate to have time to myself that I was pushing my kids away from me<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the evenings to get it.  I JUST needed a couple of hours to wind down.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It didn&#39;t work.  The kids pushed back HARD.  They would get really wound<br/>\n&gt; up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and loud.  They would tattle on each other, poke each other, pester each<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other.  I was so sick of &quot;MMMMOOOOOMMMM!!!!&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So I gave in and decided to ride the wave.  They stay up as late as they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; want as long as I am awake.  I do put the little kids down when I go to<br/>\n&gt; bed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because I have daredevils.  I also made sure that we spent lots and lots<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time outside, swimming, riding bikes, during the day.  In the evening, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would watch tv with the kids or bake.  If I wanted to read, I would sit<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the kitchen table so everyone knew where I was.  I made sure to be<br/>\nwilling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to put the book down to hold a child, get a blankie, whatever.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It only took about 4 days for things to calm down into a rhythm.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Julie S.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Andrea Burlingame&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aburlingame@...\">aburlingame@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, July 22, 2004 8:13 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] More on Bedtime was: Bedtime<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ==Why<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should anyone sleep when someone else thinks that they are tired?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the point?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pat==<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been watching this discussion carefully, because  while part of<br/>\nme<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would like to, I haven&#39;t fully embraced &quot;no bedtime&quot; for the little<br/>\nones<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my house.  My children are 10, 4.5, 3 and 1.  My answer to the above<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; question would be:  Well, for me, the point would be that *I* really<br/>\n&gt; need<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some downtime in the evening, in order to feel sane and be able to<br/>\nenjoy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; being their mommy the next day.  I feel quite strongly about this and<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; want it sooooo badly.  I can can actually feel my chest tightening<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thinking about how much this has been frustrating me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lately, bedtime has become a major hassle like never before, in part I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; believe, because the 3 yr old, instead of being in her crib now shares<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; full-size bed with the 4.5 yr old and they bug each other incessantly.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would like to get two twins, but am not in a financial position to do<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at the moment.  Anyway, for the past couple of months, I&#39;ve tinkered<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; letting them play quietly in their room if they still want to be up<br/>\npast<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 10:00, and they either play too loudly and wake the baby, or (more<br/>\n&gt; often)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they fight and wake the baby, or one calls me to tell on the other,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Maaaaaaaaahhhhhhmeeeeeeee!&quot; loudly and wakes the baby.  I can usually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; last<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; awhile, just kindly reminding them that Evan is sleeping in the next<br/>\n&gt; room<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and he&#39;s tired, etc... and hugging them and asking them to please play<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quietly or go to sleep, but by 11:30, sometimes sooner, sometimes<br/>\nlater,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; furious and yelling (under my breath) and talking to them through<br/>\n&gt; gritted<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; teeth and just completely exhasperated.  I&#39;ve tried so many ways to<br/>\ngive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them more freedom without completely giving up any opportunity to have<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; single braincell to myself, and nothing seems to work consistently.<br/>\nIn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fact, everything seems worse than when I just insisted they go to bed<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; first place.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I do truly need some time to myself, especially since my husband works<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Portland, three hours from here and is only here on weekends.  With<br/>\nkids<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this young, how can I eliminate bedtime and still enjoy the solace the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evening brings me?  Has anyone had this problem?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, what if one child is tired and the other is not?  Sometimes the<br/>\n4<br/>\n&gt; &gt; year<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; old just wants to go to sleep, but the 3 year old just HAS to bug her.<br/>\n&gt; We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t have another quiet room for her to sleep in.  The 10 year old,<br/>\nwho<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; regulates her own sleep quite well is in one of the three bedrooms,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; baby is with me in the other.  If she came out here into the living<br/>\nroom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually went to sleep, that would be one thing, but when I&#39;ve tried<br/>\n&gt; &gt; having<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her do that, she starts playing or talking to me about anything and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything (remember this is time I really, really want to myself  to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; read,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; watch an adult-themed movie, knit quietly and think...whatever!).

I wish I could just turn the corner on all of<br/>\nthis, you know?  Not just the no bedtime idea, all of it.  I&#39;m still<br/>\nstruggling with letting them choose to eat candy whenever they want. (Mainly<br/>\nbecause my 4 yo daughter wants it almost all of her waking hours and to the<br/>\nexclusion of most other food, no matter what I offer!)  The idea of letting<br/>\nmy children make their own choices about food and sleep and all makes sense<br/>\nto me when I read your posts, but I think I&#39;m still afraid of the<br/>\npossibility of complete chaos, unhealthy kids and never having a minutes<br/>\npeace again!  And I have to admit that I&#39;m having a hard time not<br/>\ncontrolling some things.  My kids do push back hard, too.  I want to just<br/>\nquit fighting them.  I think part of my fear stems from not feeling  like<br/>\n*I* have it together enough to let go of my controls over them....ugh...I<br/>\ncan&#39;t explain.  My head is foggy and tired.  I&#39;ll try again in the morning<br/>\n<br/>\nBut thank you for telling me about your experience, and thank you to others<br/>\nfor your input as well.

The kids occupy themselves for hours out there, building in the sand and playing in the tidepools and surf.  I do notice that they sleep better if we get out to the beach or for a hike or some outdoor activity every day.  Sometimes, when I&#39;m tired, or am trying to catch up on housework, we&#39;ll stay home all day, and those days are the ones that are the hardest and that lead to the most problematic nights (fighting and such...)<br/>\n<br/>\nYep, being near the beach is nice, though I don&#39;t know how long we will stay here.  Were supposed to stay through July, but it looks like there&#39;s a chance we&#39;ll stay through the winter, too.  I hope we do.  I like storm watching!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Andrea (with the sand behind my ears)  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":79727949,"authorName":"mk85s","from":"&quot;mk85s&quot; &lt;mk85s@...&gt;","profile":"mk85s","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: exercise at home was RE: mom time","postDate":"1090635836","msgId":96801,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNkc2g3cysyaHZyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzI0MDE0NTU3Lk9GUUk2MzE5Lm10YTEwLmFkZWxwaGlhLm5ldEBsZWlnaD4="},"prevInTopic":96797,"nextInTopic":96805,"prevInTime":96800,"nextInTime":96802,"topicId":96707,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There s a great website on this subject: http://www.videofitness.com/ It s loaded with reviews of videos and dvds for all fitness levels (written by regular,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-853989181\">There&#39;s a great website on this subject: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.videofitness.com/\">http://www.videofitness.com/</a> It&#39;s loaded with reviews of videos and <br/>\ndvds for all fitness levels (written by regular, at-home exercisers <br/>\nnot fitness professionals) and has a very active message board.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaria<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Angela&quot; &lt;game-<br/>\nenthusiast@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Leslie has lots of different videos and you can easily change the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>intensity<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of the workout based on your fitness level.

(before this I wasn&#39;t<br/>\ninto aerobics at all and I don&#39;t consider myself very coordinated)  I<br/>\ndiscovered Leslie Sansone Walk Aerobic tapes.  They are very basic using<br/>\njust four or five steps for the most part.  There are side steps, kicks,<br/>\nmarching in place, kick backs, and knee lifts.  They are all low impact but<br/>\nstill get me sweating.  Leslie is sweet but not sugary fake.  (get ready, I<br/>\nam going to sound like an infomercial now.)  <br/>\n <br/>\nOver the last 14 or so months, I&#39;ve lost 30 lbs and increased my muscle mass<br/>\nsubstantially.  I no longer have an aching back and I look forward to<br/>\nexercising every day.  I&#39;ve not really dieted at all but I am trying to make<br/>\nbetter choices more often and I try to eat fruits, whole grains,  and<br/>\nveggies every day.  I still eat a moderate amount of sweets, so I don&#39;t feel<br/>\nlike I am depriving myself.  My kids quickly got used to the fact that I<br/>\nexercise every morning.  They know that it is my *me* time.  I make sure<br/>\nthey have something to eat and maybe a TV show to watch.  Sometimes they<br/>\nbring their barbies down and barbie exercises with me.  :0)  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe tapes are only around $9 each at Walmart.  Often cheaper on ebay or<br/>\nhalf.com.  If you hate them, you can always re-sell them on half.com.  I am<br/>\nreally enthusiastic about them because I had tried for years to find a way<br/>\nto keep in shape with small kids and a dh that travels.  It wasn&#39;t my lack<br/>\nof willingness that kept me out of shape.  I just hadn&#39;t found an activity<br/>\nthat kept my interest that didn&#39;t kill me.  I tried the stationary bike, the<br/>\ntreadmill, walking or running outside etc.  They either bored me or I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t do them consistently because of the weather or the fact that dh<br/>\ntravels a lot.  I had done other aerobic tapes in the past, but you had to<br/>\nbe in great shape to begin with to even consider doing them.

For me it&#39;s best that it&#39;s<br/>\nlate at night when everyone else is asleep or at least tucked away. I don&#39;t<br/>\ndo well with mornings at all. Most nights my husband is in bed right after<br/>\nthe kids go to their respective corners. I wake him later for some loving<br/>\nand after over 14 years, I&#39;ve never had any complaints. &lt;BG&gt; But you said<br/>\nthat&#39;s not your problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur house is on the larger size and that makes it convenient for everyone to<br/>\nfind a place to go. There is still switching around with who is sleeping<br/>\nwhere though. My two younger girls share a room and hardly ever actually<br/>\nsleep in their beds. We are actually considering getting rid of them! The<br/>\ngirls are on the floor all the time. Sleeping in different spots and on<br/>\nsleeping bags, bean bag chairs and making various tents out of sheets and<br/>\ntables. I&#39;ve had kids sleep in the playroom and my son will also sleep with<br/>\nthe girls and vice versa. Wherever they are happy is fine with me. There has<br/>\neven been talk about them sleeping with our oldest in her room. She&#39;s up for<br/>\nit but they can&#39;t seem to get her home early enough on the nights she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to wake up early the next day. They aren&#39;t morning people<br/>\neither.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the point is I need my down time too and the kids still get to stay up<br/>\nlate. They understand respect of others in the house. Dad is in bed usually<br/>\nby 11:30 and when our oldest has to open for work the next day, she&#39;s in bed<br/>\nby that time too. Or at least in her room for the night. The youngest are 9,<br/>\n8 and 3. So as long as they are in their room or someone else&#39;s and<br/>\nrelatively quiet, they stay up and I still have my time. Of course I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave the fighting with them or have to tend to them often. Maybe try and<br/>\nstart helping them come up with solutions of their own to solve problems<br/>\nthat arise instead of you always going in to fix things. Or the one that<br/>\nsleeps well can stay with the older one that sleeps earlier. Half the time<br/>\naround here I never know where the kids will end up sleeping. But there are<br/>\nother choices aside from them sleeping early and not liking it to staying up<br/>\nlate and stressing you out.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9543528,"authorName":"Dana Matt","from":"Dana Matt &lt;hoffmanwilson@...&gt;","profile":"hoffmanwilson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"mom time, was Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] More on Bedtime  was:  Bedtime","postDate":"1090599305","msgId":96757,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzIzMTYxNTA1LjQ1ODU2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwNDA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDcwMWM0NzBjZiQxMDZkODI5MCRkNGI2Y2VkMUBoZXJvbm9mZmljZT4="},"prevInTopic":96755,"nextInTopic":96759,"prevInTime":96756,"nextInTime":96758,"topicId":96707,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My children are 10, 4.5, 3 and 1.  My answer to the above<br/>\n&gt; question would be:  Well, for me, the point would be that *I* really need<br/>\n&gt; some downtime in the evening, in order to feel sane and be able to enjoy<br/>\n&gt; being their mommy the next day.  I feel quite strongly about this and just<br/>\n&gt; want it sooooo badly.  I can can actually feel my chest tightening just<br/>\n&gt; thinking about how much this has been frustrating me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lately, bedtime has become a major hassle like never before, in part I<br/>\n&gt; believe, because the 3 yr old, instead of being in her crib now shares a<br/>\n&gt; full-size bed with the 4.5 yr old and they bug each other incessantly.  I<br/>\n&gt; would like to get two twins, but am not in a financial position to do that<br/>\n&gt; at the moment.  Anyway, for the past couple of months, I&#39;ve tinkered with<br/>\n&gt; letting them play quietly in their room if they still want to be up past<br/>\n&gt; 10:00, and they either play too loudly and wake the baby, or (more often)<br/>\n&gt; they fight and wake the baby, or one calls me to tell on the other,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Maaaaaaaaahhhhhhmeeeeeeee!&quot; loudly and wakes the baby.  I can usually<br/>\nlast<br/>\n&gt; awhile, just kindly reminding them that Evan is sleeping in the next room<br/>\n&gt; and he&#39;s tired, etc... and hugging them and asking them to please play<br/>\n&gt; quietly or go to sleep, but by 11:30, sometimes sooner, sometimes later,<br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; furious and yelling (under my breath) and talking to them through gritted<br/>\n&gt; teeth and just completely exhasperated.  I&#39;ve tried so many ways to give<br/>\n&gt; them more freedom without completely giving up any opportunity to have a<br/>\n&gt; single braincell to myself, and nothing seems to work consistently.  In<br/>\n&gt; fact, everything seems worse than when I just insisted they go to bed in<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; first place.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do truly need some time to myself, especially since my husband works in<br/>\n&gt; Portland, three hours from here and is only here on weekends.  With kids<br/>\n&gt; this young, how can I eliminate bedtime and still enjoy the solace the<br/>\n&gt; evening brings me?  Has anyone had this problem?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, what if one child is tired and the other is not?  Sometimes the 4<br/>\nyear<br/>\n&gt; old just wants to go to sleep, but the 3 year old just HAS to bug her.  We<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have another quiet room for her to sleep in.  The 10 year old, who<br/>\n&gt; regulates her own sleep quite well is in one of the three bedrooms, and<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; baby is with me in the other.  If she came out here into the living room<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; actually went to sleep, that would be one thing, but when I&#39;ve tried<br/>\nhaving<br/>\n&gt; her do that, she starts playing or talking to me about anything and<br/>\n&gt; everything (remember this is time I really, really want to myself  to<br/>\nread,<br/>\n&gt; watch an adult-themed movie, knit quietly and think...whatever!).  It just<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t work.

I can usually last<br/>\nawhile, just kindly reminding them that Evan is sleeping in the next room<br/>\nand he&#39;s tired, etc... and hugging them and asking them to please play<br/>\nquietly or go to sleep, but by 11:30, sometimes sooner, sometimes later, I&#39;m<br/>\nfurious and yelling (under my breath) and talking to them through gritted<br/>\nteeth and just completely exhasperated.  I&#39;ve tried so many ways to give<br/>\nthem more freedom without completely giving up any opportunity to have a<br/>\nsingle braincell to myself, and nothing seems to work consistently.  In<br/>\nfact, everything seems worse than when I just insisted they go to bed in the<br/>\nfirst place.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do truly need some time to myself, especially since my husband works in<br/>\nPortland, three hours from here and is only here on weekends.  With kids<br/>\nthis young, how can I eliminate bedtime and still enjoy the solace the<br/>\nevening brings me?  Has anyone had this problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, what if one child is tired and the other is not?  Sometimes the 4 year<br/>\nold just wants to go to sleep, but the 3 year old just HAS to bug her.  We<br/>\ndon&#39;t have another quiet room for her to sleep in.  The 10 year old, who<br/>\nregulates her own sleep quite well is in one of the three bedrooms, and the<br/>\nbaby is with me in the other.  If she came out here into the living room and<br/>\nactually went to sleep, that would be one thing, but when I&#39;ve tried having<br/>\nher do that, she starts playing or talking to me about anything and<br/>\neverything (remember this is time I really, really want to myself  to read,<br/>\nwatch an adult-themed movie, knit quietly and think...whatever!).  It just<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work.  Those of you who have actually gone to no bedtime when your<br/>\nkids were younger, what did you do to have time to yourself?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Andrea</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97112,"nextTopicId":97203}}
