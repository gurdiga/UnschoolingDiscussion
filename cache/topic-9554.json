Living in Seattle would be no problem for me as I&#39;m born and bred in <br/>\nEngland and so the rain is second nature for me(LOL)... My kids are born in <br/>\nthe desert though... Although Zak loves to wear socks, long pants and a long <br/>\nshirt on very hot days (something I find very distressing with 110 heat!!!).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hard part for us is that my parents are here and very involved with their <br/>\ngrandchildren.  My mother is retired... I came to motherhood later at 36 and <br/>\n40 and so my mother was really ready for grandmahood.  She sees them several <br/>\ntimes a week and Zak will go to hers for the entire afternoon one day a week. <br/>\n Also when I work on the radio she has the baby until I&#39;m done, which is <br/>\nusually about 2 hours.  So we have to balance the needs of having our kids <br/>\nhave grandparents and our needs to be in a much cooler area and also around <br/>\nmore unschoolers.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll make that decision today... I think <br/>\nI&#39;ll go put on the pork chops instead.....<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9559,"nextTopicId":9502}}
