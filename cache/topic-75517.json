My amused","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2063338978\">I&#39;m not going to flame you, but I will point out how your reply to my post<br/>\nhad nothing to do with what I actually said (or think, or feel).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As much as I know I&#39;ll get flamed -<br/>\n&gt; II think this post is decidedly hurtful. There are those of us who have<br/>\n&gt; researched and questioned; we have looked at the reports; we have shared these<br/>\n&gt; with you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So - in the face of that - your daughter says &quot;That&#39;s the stupidest thing I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; ever heard.&quot;  &quot;You are hurting my feelings talking about this.&quot;  (How is that<br/>\n&gt; possibly hurting her feelings?&quot; ) Then with a seemimngly very smug attitude<br/>\n&gt; you dismiss it!! That&#39;s the weakest  thing I&#39;ve read all month.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My amused posting of Zoe&#39;s response contained no &quot;dismissal.&quot; What led you<br/>\nto hear a &quot;smug attitude?&quot; I said not one word about my own feelings about<br/>\nmilk - except that one could correctly deduce that I took the milk-free<br/>\nsuggestions seriously since I am the one who brought them up with Zoe.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you misread my &quot; gotta love those teens&quot; as me agreeing with her<br/>\nresponse. If so, you really made a leap and hammered me for your own<br/>\nmistake.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;You are hurting my feelings talking about this.&quot;  (How is that  possibly<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hurting her feelings?&quot; )<br/>\n<br/>\nI think her feelings were about not wanting to discuss her skin problems.<br/>\nShe&#39;s embarrassed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Whether we like it or not -<br/>\n&gt; Dairy products are filled with chemicals and poisons.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with you. The dairy products in my house are all organic. (Except<br/>\nfor the occasional Breyer&#39;s Ice Cream).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Rather than look into what is being said here.....it&#39;s dismissed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Under what definition of open-minded is that?<br/>\n&gt; Under what definition of intelligent is that?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, I get it, you feel strongly about this issue, but once again I say,<br/>\nwhoa, read again, no dismissal in my post (except by Zoe). Certainly nothing<br/>\nto justify the above intense - and hurtful - words about open-mindedness and<br/>\nintelligence.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Refusing to examine what is the dairy industry...and what it does to us......<br/>\n&gt; is just plain foolish.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s not like you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not, but I&#39;m not quite sure how you know me well enough to know that.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75330,"nextTopicId":75095}}
