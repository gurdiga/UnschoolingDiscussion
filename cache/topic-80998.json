As much as I<br/>\n loved them and they were both wonderful in many ways - that one thing<br/>\n kept a bit of distance between us.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell Sunday is my day to rest my brain but you ladies are making that very<br/>\nhard to do. I let a few posts go by because I didn&#39;t want to take the time<br/>\nto respond but this whole thread really has be thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t say I ever remember either of my parents telling me they were proud<br/>\nof me. Not saying they never did, just that I can&#39;t remember that happening.<br/>\nRegarding my mom, I have always felt like nothing I ever did was enough to<br/>\nplease her. Not anything in school, work, relationships, family, nothing. In<br/>\nfact, even now, I just get the feeling like nothing will ever be good<br/>\nenough. She gives me cards on special occasions sometimes that say<br/>\notherwise, but her actions tell me I will never be the kind of daughter she<br/>\nhad hoped for. And deep down I&#39;m thinking I am something for her to be proud<br/>\nof, she just can&#39;t bring herself to let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad, on the other hand, always made me feel loved and I felt like he was<br/>\nextremely proud of me, even though I can&#39;t remember him saying so. He was<br/>\nthe only person I trusted wholeheartedly and I always knew I had his<br/>\nunconditional love and acceptance. He was everything to me and even after<br/>\nalmost 19 years, he&#39;s missed dearly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I can&#39;t remember anything in particular either parent did or didn&#39;t do,<br/>\nbut it must have been the small day to day conversations, hugs, looks, etc<br/>\nthat made such a difference in how I responded to each. Point being, I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink saying I&#39;m proud of you once in awhile, along with seeing how else we<br/>\nparent is a wrong thing. I also think one can get that point across well<br/>\nwithout ever using that word too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t say I use that word much, but I have used it. And I have said, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>\nproud of you&quot; to me kids. I&#39;ve also heard my kids when they were small walk<br/>\naround and say &quot;I&#39;m so proud.&quot; In the way they used it, they were extremely<br/>\npleased with themselves about something they did. And when I have used it, I<br/>\nhave used it in that way also. Being very happy *for them* about something<br/>\nthey accomplished. The only time I can remember is when one of them have<br/>\nhandled a situation, like with a cranky sibling, in a manner that we had<br/>\ntalked about previously. So when I saw that they *got it* and used the tools<br/>\nwe spoke of to handle something, I did say I was proud of them for not<br/>\nlosing their temper or hitting and doing the best thing under the<br/>\ncircumstances. So when I have said I was proud, I pinpointed exactly what it<br/>\nwas that I was happy with. I&#39;m also hoping, and I think I succeeded in<br/>\nletting them know it wasn&#39;t anything I had ownership of, but all their own<br/>\ndoing. And thinking of the times they have used that word themselves, I&#39;m<br/>\nsure they understood how I meant it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI looked up proud too. It says, &quot;Feeling pleasurable satisfaction over an<br/>\nattribute or act by which one&#39;s status or sense of self is measured.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the thinking today, even though I didn&#39;t really want it. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Seemingly Off Topic/ starting to read","postDate":"1064171922","msgId":81153,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY5RTM0MjU1LUVDNjgtMTFENy1BQjBELTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExNi4yOGQ1YmMzMC4yYzlmNGFhNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":81150,"nextInTopic":81155,"prevInTime":81152,"nextInTime":81154,"topicId":80998,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

As much as I <br/>\nloved them and they were both wonderful in many ways - that one thing <br/>\nkept a bit of distance between us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m aware of this - but I&#39;ve done some of the same stuff anyway. As <br/>\nconscious as we may think we are, we STILL will look back and realize <br/>\nwe did things we didn&#39;t intend - it is extraordinary difficult to break <br/>\nout of parenting our children in ways we were parented, when we get <br/>\ndown to the more subtle aspects.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom was very very &quot;aware&quot; of the influence of her own attitude and <br/>\nwords on her kids&#39; sense of self, for want of a better expression. For <br/>\nexample, she didn&#39;t say things like, &quot;That is good,&quot; in response to our <br/>\nartistic attempts - singing or painting or whatever, because she didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to give us the underlying message that SHE was the arbiter of what <br/>\nwas good and what was not. She&#39;d ask questions, show lots of interest, <br/>\nadmire various aspects of what we&#39;d done, say that she appreciated us <br/>\nsharing it, that she&#39;d enjoyed it, etc., but not tell us it was great, <br/>\nwonderful, good, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of parents think that praise is so important. But I really don&#39;t <br/>\nthink it is - I think it is a double-edged sword, in fact. And if we <br/>\nhave a habit of saying, &quot;I&#39;m proud of you,&quot; that might, indeed, be <br/>\nsomething worth spending some time observing and pondering - asking <br/>\nourselves whether our kids might be picking up an unintended message in <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, it is important to let our spouses and kids and <br/>\nother relatives know we appreciate and admire them, and I think that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat people sometimes use, &quot;I&#39;m proud of you,&quot; to mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nI looked up &quot;proud&quot; and the first thing it says is:<br/>\nFeeling pleasurable satisfaction over an act, possession, quality, or <br/>\nrelationship by which one measures one&#39;s stature or self-worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - again, might well be worth reconsidering whether we want to use <br/>\nthat term - we don&#39;t want our kids to think OUR self-worth depends on <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nChanging terminology can also be really sweet and powerful - much more <br/>\nmeaningful than a common phrase. A couple of days ago, Sandra told me <br/>\nto tell my 16 yo daughter &quot;Happy Birthday and I&#39;m really glad I know <br/>\nyou.&quot; Roxana got tears in her eyes and said, &quot;Tell her I&#39;m really glad <br/>\nI know her too.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(So - Sandra, consider yourself told &lt;G&gt;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to say one more thing about parents praise and especially, <br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m proud of you.&quot; Its such a general statement - and every kid has <br/>\nfeelings and even has done things that they think their parents <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be proud of, if they knew. So when a parent says, &quot;I&#39;m proud <br/>\nof you,&quot; some kids (great kids whose parents would be surprised to know <br/>\nthey feel this way) will say to themselves, &quot;You wouldn&#39;t be so proud <br/>\nif you knew what I sometimes think or do.&quot; That is not the effect the <br/>\nparent thinks their praise is having.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":158112576,"authorName":"TeresaBnNC@aol.com","from":"TeresaBnNC@...","profile":"tbb1967","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Seemingly Off Topic/ starting to read","postDate":"1064170736","msgId":81155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjOC5mNDlhZGEzLjJjOWY0ZWYwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":81153,"nextInTopic":81166,"prevInTime":81154,"nextInTime":81156,"topicId":80998,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/21/03 2:41:28 PM Eastern Daylight Time, Dnowens@aol.com ... .

To say you are proud of someone else&#39;s accomplishment implies that you had something to do with it.   I think this is part of the authoritarian stance most parents have taken.  We have grown to take it for granted without thinking about what it means.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt is one of those things that really bug me too.

They usually roll their eyes or run away.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI agree that saying &quot;I&#39;m proud of you &quot; is taking ownership of that person&#39;s actions.  It&#39;s patronizing, as I think Sandra said.   When Gillen did well in a soccer game I said, &quot;How did it feel to play so well?  I am so impressed by how well you play.&quot;  Or I&#39;ll say, &quot;Do you feel proud of yourself?&quot; about something he does but that sounds kind of funny to me when I say it.

I&#39;m really proud of you for writing <br/>\nthat,&quot; wouldn&#39;t it seem at the very least condescending?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what the storyreminded me of:  another story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a time five or six years ago when a really glorious batch of SCA <br/>\nsquires and apprentices were  hanging out with me regularly.  My husband was <br/>\nworking in Minnesota, and his two squires were over talking to me regularly.  Our <br/>\nclosest SCA friend was mostly inactive then, but had a hot squire, also <br/>\nhanging out with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went out of town to a big feast in Socorro and stayed in a motel suite.  <br/>\nThey ranged in age from 22 to 36, and there were six of them, with me being the <br/>\nonly one of any SCA rank in the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the feast, our table was sparkly, intensely period, beautifully set, <br/>\nhappy, and then at one point it was EMPTY. Each of them was off doing something <br/>\ndifferent, something useful, and I was the only one in the group who knew they <br/>\nwere all out and about, and what they were doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we reviewed the evening and people went to sleep happy, I was in the room <br/>\nwith the last two awake.  I said I had the urge to say &quot;I&#39;m proud of you&quot; but <br/>\nit seems an awful thing to say.  We discussed my reservations about saying it, <br/>\nand what alternative ways to express it could be, so because of that <br/>\ndiscussion, and because of my thoughts concerning my kids&#39; accomplishments (because <br/>\nthey were 11, 8 and 6 or so in those days) I&#39;ve considered this quite a bit<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I say to grown men &quot;I&#39;m proud of you,&quot; it seems wrong.  It seems like <br/>\n&quot;Good dog!&quot;  Or it seems like &quot;Great, thanks for making me look good.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThough I had a strong emotion, &quot;proud of you&quot; has the implication of <br/>\nownership.  Either ownership of the person or of the performance.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo although after discussion they decided they didn&#39;t mind me saying I was <br/>\nproud of them, I was still uncomfortable.   One outranks me now (the youngest is <br/>\na Duke now, and a knight).  The other was then a law student but is now about <br/>\nto become a special assistant prosecutor or some such, remarkably early for <br/>\nan assistant district attorney.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen one of my kids does something that causes that swelling-up feeling in <br/>\nme, I try to paraphrase &quot;I&#39;m proud of you&quot; in away that I would&#39;t  find saying <br/>\nto an adult friend.  I use these things instead:<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was pretty impressive!<br/>\nI think they were lucky to have you there.<br/>\nI&#39;m glad to know you.<br/>\nEven if I weren&#39;t your mom I&#39;d still really like to know you.<br/>\nI wish I&#39;d had friends like you when I was your age.<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t it feel good when things turn out that well?<br/>\n<br/>\n(I note from the list that the things I&#39;ve been proud of lately have involved <br/>\nsocial responsibility.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it makes a difference in the relationship between the parent and <br/>\nchild for the parent to acknowledge that the child is a separate person with his <br/>\nown powers of accomplishment. Admiring someone from a little distance is a <br/>\ndifferent thing from being proud of them, and though I&#39;m not finding it easy to <br/>\ndescribe in words, it&#39;s clear in my heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":133382326,"authorName":"gothmom527","from":"&quot;gothmom527&quot; &lt;gothmom527@...&gt;","profile":"gothmom527","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Seemingly Off Topic/ starting to read","postDate":"1064123011","msgId":81091,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJramRxMyttY2kzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA3Y2EwMWMzN2ZiOCRkZWZhNDcwMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBsaXZpbmdyb29tMT4="},"prevInTopic":81051,"nextInTopic":81097,"prevInTime":81090,"nextInTime":81092,"topicId":80998,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i read this over a few times trying to figure out exactly what is so offensive about someone having pride in your child.  i just can t find anything untoward","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-533367936\">i read this over a few times trying to figure out exactly what is so<br/>\noffensive about someone having pride in your child.  i just can&#39;t find<br/>\nanything untoward in that statement at all.<br/>\nrecognition of your childs accomplishments is not the same as anyone<br/>\nattempting to take credit for them.<br/>\nkimberleigh<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; **Jon&#39;s mother came over this morning.
