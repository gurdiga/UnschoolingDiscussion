I have never tried to scare him with scary or horrifying stories.  I have told him that animals that live on feedlots, large scale &quot;farms,&quot; are usually not humanely treated.  I have talked more about the treatment of the living animals than the slaughter of them.  In fact I don&#39;t think I have ever told him anything about the way they die, just that I think animals should be treated humanely while they are on this earth.   As far as animals in the wild and lions smothering wildebeest, lions don&#39;t have the luxury (or the ability) to think about what is humane.  We do.  I firmly believe that if we can do it better, we should.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy vegetarianism is due to antibiotic and hormone use as well as treatment of animals.  We have talked about antibiotics and hormones, he goes with me when I buy free-range eggs.  I do eat the others occasionally, ie when I can&#39;t afford the free-range, but I have told him that when I can I will choose free-range and antibiotic free eggs, and antibiotic and hormone free milk or soy milk.  He has seen me eat meat a few times in his life.  If someone cooks for us, I pretty much eat what they cook.  I am a single mom and money is tight, and if someone is generous enough to make us a meal, I eat what they cook.  I think that is common courtesy, as long as we are not talking about an allergy.  So, my original point to him was that if we have the choice (we are at a restaurant that does offer a veggieburger), we should choose the more organic/more humane alternative.   BUT, I recognize that this is my opinion, which I was forcing on him, hence my feeling badly about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaty<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":153142310,"authorName":"Robin","from":"&quot;Robin&quot; &lt;tri_mom@...&gt;","profile":"the_clevengers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Food Choices & Food Allergies","postDate":"1112112120","msgId":105005,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjkwMWM1MzQ3OCRhNDFjMTFiMCRhYjQzMTYxOEBCZWRyb29tMT4="},"prevInTopic":105004,"nextInTopic":105007,"prevInTime":105004,"nextInTime":105006,"topicId":104852,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The parents and kids raised chickens from baby chicks, and eventually came the day when they killed them and had a chicken dinner - they went through the whole process. Many of the kids really enjoyed this.  That&#39;s one way to expose kids to the actual reality of it. I know my two would have been *so* upset about it and would not be able to do that. That is how I was as a child - so sensitive to this kind of thing that even thinking about it bothered me (my aunt had a sheepskin rug that she still referred to as &quot;Michael&quot; - the lamb she raised for 4H, and that always freaked me out). That&#39;s why I became a vegetarian as soon as I had control over my own food (and I grew up for some years on a farm and my grandma whacked the heads off of chickens and they ran around the yard headless, so it certainly wasn&#39;t lack of exposure that made me so sensitive!). Both of my kids eat very little meat, by choice, and their main reason is that it bothers them to think about killing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my kids, I think what I really try to do is avoid exaggerations and propaganda. When I was a vegetarian (which I no longer am), I explained my reasons for not eating meat in straightforward, yet not overly-gory ways. I made sure to explain that not all people are vegetarian, that I respect other peoples&#39; right to make different choices. I also made sure to tell them that I thought eating meat was a very natural thing (witness all the carnivores in nature) and that most indigenous peoples didn&#39;t really have a choice to be vegetarian or not - the labor-intensiveness of a vegetarian diet in a natural setting is not something humans are well set up for. Without the ruminous stomachs of creatures like cows, we&#39;re not able to extract enough nutrients from plant matter efficiently so that the sheer act of gathering food would use up as much or more calories as could be gathered (except in areas of extreme abundance, like coastal areas). Thus, vegetarianism is largely supported by a modern lifestyle with modern farming methods. Even in my 20 years as a vegetarian, I didn&#39;t really see slaughtering an animal by slitting it&#39;s throat as anything much worse than, say, a lion smothering it by biting it&#39;s nose, dragging it over to its side, and other lions starting to eat it while it was still smothering.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome friends of ours are ardent vegetarians, and instead of giving their kids information, they&#39;ve told them what to believe. Thus, whenever their kids see someone eating meat, they start spouting off about how inhumane and cruel it is and all that. A couple of times I&#39;ve offered to show them some National Geographic videos of lions killing wildebeest and described the process to them. They were a bit taken aback that this could be the way nature actually works. So, since their parents only gave them one way of looking at this, when faced with differing information it is confusing to them. They&#39;ve been told absolutes, in a world in which there really aren&#39;t many. If killing animals is inhumane, then God sure set things up funny, eh? I think it&#39;s much better to give kids as reasonable and realistic information as you can - &quot;Here&#39;s why I made the choices I did. Here&#39;s why other people might make different choices.&quot; - and then let them figure out what they believe from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Food Choices & Food Allergies","postDate":"1112111060","msgId":105004,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVhN2FmMGVmNTM4MGUwY2JkYmFmMzRkZDhkYmU2YzdiQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGQyYW83aCsxNjIyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGQyYW83aCsxNjIyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":105003,"nextInTopic":105005,"prevInTime":105003,"nextInTime":105005,"topicId":104852,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

(I trimmed this post far too much)<br/>\nI agree that we need to be aware (key word).<br/>\nI should have mentioned that my big thing is that the food be organic and <br/>\npreservative free (and i know it&#39;s almost impossible to be 100% when out but we <br/>\ntry to be mindful even then).<br/>\nOther than that, if my daughter wanted to eat 20 cookies in a row that were <br/>\norganic (preferably made by me, health food store second choice) I wouldn&#39;t bat <br/>\nan eye. I do this myself on occasion.<br/>\nBut since unschooling is about being mindful and respectful I think we have <br/>\nto respect people, animals and the earth as well.

I would certainly not keep an <br/>\nanimal chained in my back yard, feed it diseased animal parts even though it is a <br/>\nvegetarian, and force it to give me milk or eggs and then cruelly kill it.<br/>\nI would encourage my child not to eat products that were produced in that way <br/>\nuntil they could see for themself where it comes from. Mindful. Today we are <br/>\nso removed from where our food comes from that we just see it packaged so <br/>\nbeautifully and think it&#39;s great. We don&#39;t see the years of suffering that took to <br/>\nget that burger or the 1,000 rotten oranges they had to pasteurize to get <br/>\ntheir juice, or the &quot;tomato flavor&quot; they had to add to your franken-tomato to <br/>\nmake it taste like one again!<br/>\nUnschooling is about being creative too and what is more creative than making <br/>\nyour own pop tarts or going on a journey to find better ones? Like you said a <br/>\npop tart is nothing more than fruit filling with dough and icing. It can be <br/>\ndone.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not as though the child is saying I will ONLY eat KELLOGS brand pop <br/>\ntarts. They just tried something and maybe they liked the fruit part, maybe the <br/>\nmiddle, maybe the icing (i remember eating them when i was a kid and the dough <br/>\ntasted yucky to me). Experimenting is fun.<br/>\nI would never tell my daughter that she couldn&#39;t have something but I would <br/>\nfind better alternatives. I agree with the pp that said my daughter is still <br/>\nyoung and that I will have new challenges to face when she comes home from a <br/>\nfriend&#39;s house and wants a hot dog.<br/>\nAbsolutely. I will get the least disgusting organic hot dog I can find.<br/>\nI should add that I&#39;m not a vegetarian. I don&#39;t have all organic clothing. I <br/>\nam not proud of that but I do eat organic and I think that makes a difference. <br/>\nThe animals are leading a more natural life and they are not full of <br/>\nantibiotics/preservatives etc. I buy raw milk products and grass fed animals. I do try <br/>\nto make sure my clothes didn&#39;t come from a kid in a sweatshop.<br/>\nI try to think about the healthiest people and what they eat: lots of <br/>\nveggies/fruits/fermented stuff/wine/fish etc. I think about what I am: a human. I <br/>\nhave a long digestive track, not a short one so I don&#39;t think I was designed to <br/>\neat much meat. I don&#39;t have sharp teeth for tearing flesh. I think we&#39;ve <br/>\nadapted which is fine but I don&#39;t need steak every night. I eat mostly <br/>\nfruits/veggies/fish/chicken some grains/legumes.

I was young <br/>\nand was afraid of both manufacturing  places (where were those powdered <br/>\nadditives from, and what was IN there?) and of  random germs and dirt.<br/>\n <br/>\nYet I&#39;ve eaten all kinds of foods and lived past the age of 50.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I was going to LLL, I was involved in a couple of mothering groups on  <br/>\nthe side (inspired by but not LLL).  It was interesting to see which moms  were <br/>\nuber-controlling, and what their justifications were, and how their kids  <br/>\nresponded.  Even very young kids can be pretty sneaky and resistent in the  face <br/>\nof unreasonable and constant &quot;no&quot; or &quot;you don&#39;t need that&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s not  how <br/>\nwe live.&quot;  It seemed sometimes that a mom would be way more concerned  with <br/>\nhow impressed the other kids were that her child was wearing all organic  <br/>\nnaturally-dyed cotton than that her child really needed to pee, or was getting  <br/>\nmosquito bites and wanted to go home.  If they were mindful, it was too  often <br/>\nmindful of their image in the presence of strangers, not mindful of  the <br/>\nimmediate needs of their children.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-Not all research is created equal, and it&#39;s quite easy to go out and  <br/>\nfind research saying how bad soy is and how good soy is, how bad meat is  <br/>\nand how good meat is. It&#39;s just not a definitive science.-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nMilk was (probably still is in some places) forced on kids when I was going  <br/>\nto school.  &quot;Drink your milk&quot; wasn&#39;t really an option.  They tried to  force <br/>\nus to eat canned spinach and stewed plums (which I could handle now if I  were <br/>\npressed to, but could NOT at the age of ten).  Now it&#39;s known that  LOTS of <br/>\npeople shouldn&#39;t have cow&#39;s milk. It&#39;s worse for them than having  nothing.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s not &quot;healthy&quot; or &quot;nutritious.&quot;  Still occasionally I  find reference in <br/>\nadvice to pregnant women that they MUST drink milk, so they  can make milk.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s just stupid.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe four food groups were replaced by the food pyramid.  That lasted  20 <br/>\nyears or less, and has been revamped, and the modern scientific news that  <br/>\nresulted in a four-level pyramid rather than a 2x2 block to model the  correct <br/>\nbalance of food intake has been replaced by... what?  What shape is  &quot;right&quot; <br/>\nnutrition now?<br/>\n <br/>\nCheese is great food for some people, and not for others.  <br/>\nCabbage is great for some people and turns others into crampy fart  stations.<br/>\nTomatoes are WONDERFUL for those who like them and digest them well.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re not crucially necessary for any creature (but maybe  hornworms).<br/>\n <br/>\nHelping children learn early to be flexible and to really feel what their  <br/>\nbody might need (more juice or fruit?  Protein?  Bread or  noodles?  Something <br/>\nhot and smoothe?  Crunchy and salty?) is a gift  far beyond teaching them rules <br/>\nand categories and what is &quot;junk&quot;/poison and what  is perfect.

I tell him when <br/>\na food likely has corn syrup in it, and sometimes he&#39;ll choose to skip <br/>\nit, other times he&#39;ll eat it. It&#39;s pretty hard to escape in the world of <br/>\nrestaurants and hotels, so we&#39;ll all notice a significant difference by <br/>\nthe end of a vacation. It&#39;s not a life or death thing, so we&#39;re lucky in <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has meant that at home we do an incredible amount of <br/>\nexperimentation. We&#39;ve found so many wonderful substitutes for most <br/>\nsnack foods and treat foods, that none of us miss corn syrup and, in <br/>\nfact, find we PREFER foods without it because other foods taste too <br/>\nsweet. Breyer&#39;s ice cream is delicious, Nature&#39;s Path makes a very tasty <br/>\noreo cookie, I make many foods from scratch. There are choices out there <br/>\nthat can satisfy both taste and health.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint is, if my kids came home from a friend&#39;s house, asking for <br/>\npoptarts, we&#39;d go on a mission to find some we liked and that felt <br/>\nhealthy to us. We&#39;d buy all the brands we could find that didn&#39;t have <br/>\ncorn syrup and do taste tests. We&#39;d try making our own at home. There <br/>\nare lots of other options, and if we couldn&#39;t find one that satisfied, <br/>\nthen we&#39;d likely decide that the poptarts would be a once in a while <br/>\ntreat rather than something we&#39;d have in the house as a regular choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s something in between villifying foods as evil and eating them <br/>\nthoughtlessly. Not all foods are created equal. Some foods do more to <br/>\nhelp our bodies than other foods.

I  don&#39;t <br/>\nshop in bookstores with a blindfold on and just buy the first book I pick  up <br/>\nthat feels good in my hand.  It doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t tell the difference  <br/>\nbetween apples and Apple Jacks.  If I tell a child that an apple will cure  him and <br/>\nApple Jacks will kill him, I&#39;d be a big liar.<br/>\n <br/>\nSome parents DO speak of food in very extreme terms, and branding anything  <br/>\n&quot;junk&quot; is a good example of that.  <br/>\n <br/>\nPop Tarts are bought here about once every two years, for a big  campout.  <br/>\nThe next year, the leftovers from the year before are usually  still around, <br/>\nwhich is why not EVERY year.  The kids like the strawberry or  cinnamon/brown <br/>\nsugar pop tarts, not the sprinkly sparkly pink stuff.  In  northern New Mexico <br/>\nthere are two traditional foods that are the traditional  precursors of <br/>\npoptarts.  One is a Hispanic fruit pie, not quite as flat,  called a couple of things, <br/>\nbut &quot;empanadas,&quot; sometimes.  It will have jelly  or preserves in a round <br/>\npiece of dough folded over and crimped shut and  baked.  Then there&#39;s a Pueblo <br/>\nIndian version often made with a prune  filling, but sometimes other fruit, <br/>\nusually made in the winter (Christmas and  winter feasts) and they&#39;re made flat in <br/>\na pan and sliced.  They&#39;re as flat  as pop-tarts, but the edges aren&#39;t sealed. <br/>\n In Europe in the Middle Ages  such little pies were common too, and still in <br/>\nbakeries you can find them, but  they tend to be fatter and raised now, maybe <br/>\npartly because the storage and  transportation of bakery-to-home-in-a-car <br/>\nisn&#39;t much problem and they don&#39;t need  to be flat and stackable.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s easier to just declare it &quot;junk.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nBut as to peer pressure, my kids don&#39;t eat ANYthing because of peer  <br/>\npressure, but a lot of people I know who shun certain foods or t-shirts with  cartoon <br/>\ncharacters or modern pop music or video games do clearly and absolutely  pick <br/>\nthose attitudes up from peer pressure, and often from mothering groups  where <br/>\nthe goal is to be more-natural-than-thou.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe first assumption of people who know we have sodas and cookies is  <br/>\nprobably to think that the kids wake up and lunge for them, or have a soda in  one <br/>\nhand and a cookie on the other and a dopey grin all day.   At the  moment, there <br/>\nare homemade lemon cookies in the cookie jar and a bowl of  dum-dums (all the <br/>\nflavors Holly doesn&#39;t like, and they sit and sit; Keith will  eventually take <br/>\nthem to work and leave them on the snack table).<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat I saw eaten yesterday was tuna & egg salad on homemade bread,  grilled <br/>\ncheese on that bread, leftover spaghetti, a boca burger (Holly made her  own <br/>\nwhile Keith and I were out getting free scrapwood), Marty and Kirby went to  a <br/>\nfriend&#39;s family birthday dinner (friend turning 22, celebrated at home with  <br/>\nparents and grandparents and three or five friends, two of which were my teen  <br/>\nboys).   Holly and I had sourdough English muffins with cream cheese  and <br/>\ncherry butter.  She drank milk, I had tea.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy kids make better food choices than my husband does, and I think it&#39;s  <br/>\ndirectly attributable to his growing up with limitations, measurement, pressure  <br/>\nto finish, pressure to STOP, and shaming.  He learned to eat at home and  then <br/>\neat elsewhere too.  He ate to feel better.  My kids only eat when  they&#39;re <br/>\nhungry.  They don&#39;t eat for emotional comfort.  They don&#39;t  even eat socially.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re all really fine with going to a restaurant with  hungry friends and <br/>\njust having a drink instead of a meal.  They&#39;re not  &quot;dessert trained.&quot;  They <br/>\nwill say, &quot;No thanks, I&#39;ve already eaten,&quot; instead  of eating even if it&#39;s their <br/>\nfavorite food.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut it couldn&#39;t happen unless they had real freedom of choice.<br/>\n <br/>\nI wrote it better here:<br/>\n <br/>\n--------------<br/>\n <br/>\nHolly says the ice cream we have in the freezer is too sweet. She had  <br/>\nchocolate milk last night and said there was too much chocolate in it, so she  <br/>\ndivided it and made chocolate milk for someone else with half of it. She usually  <br/>\nprefers plain milk.  <br/>\nPlain milk tastes WAY better if it&#39;s your choice than if does when it&#39;s plain <br/>\n because someone else wouldn&#39;t let you put chocolate in it.  <br/>\nWithout free choice, how can a person choose what is plain and good?  <br/>\n(continued here:  _<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/respect_\">http://sandradodd.com/respect_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/respect)\">http://sandradodd.com/respect)</a>  <br/>\nbut it&#39;s not just about food, it&#39;s about abundance and awareness and  <br/>\nrespect) <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela S","from":"&quot;Angela S&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Food Choices & Food Allergies","postDate":"1111752303","msgId":104867,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwMzI1MTIwNTAwLk9UQlQ1NDAyLm10YTExLmFkZWxwaGlhLm5ldEBsZWlnaD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDdiLjQxYmQzM2MxLjJmNzRlYmQwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":104857,"nextInTopic":104868,"prevInTime":104866,"nextInTime":104868,"topicId":104852,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-636632341\">&lt;&lt;&lt;I think being <br/>\nsocially and nutritionally responsible does help shape a child&#39;s eating <br/>\nhabits........and to me that is a good thing.

I&#39;ve been lurking here only a couple of weeks but felt<br/>\nthe need to jump in here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a daughter with so many food allergies that the board certified<br/>\nped allergist we took her to asked me what I was gonna do about it (of<br/>\ncourse then he proceeded to write a really bad review of me in the<br/>\nfiles you are not supposed to see...)...long story that&#39;s not relevant<br/>\nhere.  (She literally tested positive to every food in the American<br/>\ndiet...until they ran out of blood sample...)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always let my kids have pretty much whatever they want...within<br/>\nlimits set by DH & myself out of necessity (severe eczema is no picnic<br/>\nfor anyone let alone a 2 yr old).  As she&#39;s grown older we&#39;ve allowed<br/>\nher more & more choices (expanding those limits) to the point that she<br/>\ncurrently eats whatever she wants to...IF she wants to.  She reads<br/>\nlabels for the worst allergens (in our case soy is the worst) and asks<br/>\nquestions even at restaurants (she is 9 in a couple of weeks).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our home we only keep items that are &quot;safe&quot; for her (thankfully no<br/>\none else has food allergies or it&#39;d be really difficult, but not<br/>\nimpossible)...that way whenever we are out & about she can choose<br/>\nwhether or not to eat the &quot;bad&quot; foods.  She knows what they are & that<br/>\nif she eats them she will prolly be taking Benadryl (which she hates<br/>\nbecause it makes her soooo tired).<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that as the parents it is our responsibility to decide what<br/>\nis in our children&#39;s best interest and therefore we make the initial<br/>\nchoice of what to bring into the home and she can choose anything from<br/>\nthat...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the responsibility to ensure our daughter&#39;s safety & if an<br/>\nallergy is bad enough to cause problems (even if they are not<br/>\nlife-threatening...quality of life is a valid issue in my mind) then<br/>\nWE are responsible for managing it...UNTIL such time as they can<br/>\nmanage it themselves.  When they are little they should not have to<br/>\nshoulder the burden of an allergy and avoiding the offending<br/>\nfoods...WE should do that until they can learn by talking/explaining<br/>\nthings to them & providing them &quot;safe&quot; choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend that also has a daughter about the same age with<br/>\nallergies & she has always restricted/limited what, when, etc.  She&#39;s<br/>\nalways sneaking off the eat the &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; and she doesn&#39;t<br/>\nreally know what or why she can&#39;t have it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDD does not eat anything different from anyone else, because we as a<br/>\nfamily only eat items that are safe FOR HER until she is old enough to<br/>\nunderstand & accept that others do not have to be selective. (all for<br/>\none & one for all!)  We&#39;ve always felt it unfair to have DD eat<br/>\nsomething that we wouldn&#39;t eat ourselves so...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this has helped her more than anything...seeing us eat the<br/>\nsame foods without the comments all the time about wouldn&#39;t it be nice<br/>\nif we could have...she just thinks these are normal foods. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids make such good choices when eating that it sometimes puts me<br/>\nto shame... :D<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one in our house has a sweet tooth (although good chocolate is the<br/>\none exception)...which is really awful for someone that loves to bake<br/>\ndesserts. :(  No one eats them so I make enough to quell my need to<br/>\nbake then freeze for those times we can&#39;t/don&#39;t bake.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this has gotten so long...I&#39;ll go back to lurking now...<br/>\n<br/>\nMary in Poulsbo</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49347,"nextTopicId":105051}}
