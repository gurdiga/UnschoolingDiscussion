That said,  I have seen these individual power trip<br/>\ndemands about &quot;signature=cursive&quot;.     Even with adults .....e.g.  new<br/>\ntellers at a bank wanting the signature on a check to be two names written<br/>\nin pretty cursive.     Where I come from  I would wager that the majority of<br/>\nadult &quot;signatures&quot;  are NOT in cursive.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nA few years ago I tangled with the director of  a large umbrella soccer<br/>\nassociation who was holding a meeting with club registrars and was insisting<br/>\nthat the player ID  cards required a  players signature (&quot;and that means<br/>\ncursive&quot;).     Her view was that player cards were usually for children at<br/>\nleast 9 years old and they &quot;should&quot;  know cursive by then.    &quot;Just tell<br/>\nthem they have  to put both names and in cursive&quot;.    I argued with her<br/>\nabout BOTH  &quot;her&quot;  requirements for a signature and suggested it was<br/>\ninappropriate for her to be dispensing such erroneous information.     It&#39;s<br/>\nhow urban myths get started.  Bear in mind she wanted kids to be &quot;signing&quot;<br/>\nnames that might be completely different from the names they used in day to<br/>\nday life.    Made me think of 80 years ago and schoolteachers who decided<br/>\nwhat names were &quot;proper&quot;  regardless of what might be on the birth<br/>\ncertificate!     <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nUsing a &quot;legal&quot;  name these days for official documents  (in the spaces<br/>\nwhere they say &quot;type or print legibly&quot;) is one thing.  The whole point of a<br/>\n&quot;signature&quot;  is  to be unique to the person.    In my years I have seen a<br/>\nvariety of signatures that bore little to no resemblance to the the full<br/>\nlegal name written in any of the standard cursive styles.     Time was,  the<br/>\nrecommendation was to avoid the  &quot;schoolteacher hand&quot;  for a signature so<br/>\nthat it would be more difficult to forge.   Times change. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nvicki<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of jenstarc4<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 03, 2006 3:06 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Writing signatures<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat seems awfully bossy for a DMV person to insist that someone <br/>\nresign in cursive.
