I have MAJOR suger cravings<br/>\nand processed carbo cravings.  My niece was recently diagnosed with PCOS<br/>\n(poly-cystene-ovarian syndrome).  They told her the underlying cause was<br/>\ninsulin resistance.  And that her condition is most certainly genetic.  I<br/>\nseem to have many of the conditions of this syndrome.....just thinking about<br/>\nexploring this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso,  my 1 yr old son has had excema from the get-go.  Where have people<br/>\ngotten info regarding realtionship with food.  He&#39;s breastfed,  could my<br/>\ndiet effect his excema?<br/>\nSusan,  who has been able to establish relatively healthy disciplines for<br/>\nmost things,  but cannot seem to control sugar/carb cravings in the least.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy &quot;old man Physician&quot; explained in very technical terms about allergies<br/>\nand how they can (in some cases but not all) often cause cravings similar<br/>\nto an alcoholics craving for booze.  I forget now the reasons behind it,<br/>\nbut I know from experience that it can be true.  He also warned me to be<br/>\nexpecially careful with the alcohol I drank.  I am allergic to corn and<br/>\ncrave it.  I also come from a family with a high history of alcoholism.<br/>\nHe said I should stay far away from  corn-mash bourbons.  I did, but<br/>\nmostly because I have tastes for other things and don&#39;t drink much<br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27720,"nextTopicId":27726}}
