For those interested, I wanted to send out some updated <br/>\ninformation about the L.L.G. - Lifetime Learners of Georgia <br/>\nHomeschooling Support Group. We are starting up 4 new Area Groups, <br/>\nbringing us to 10 total area groups that we hope will be of great <br/>\nhelp to homeschoolers in Georgia! Below is a listing of all our Area <br/>\nGroups including the 4 new ones. The *new* Area Groups will <br/>\nofficially be starting up in September though we already have some <br/>\nmembers for all of them. Also included is a little information about <br/>\nthe L.L.G. Group. If you have any questions about our group, please <br/>\nfeel free to contact me! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLocations of our Current Area Groups: <br/>\n<br/>\n1. L.L.G. Area One Group:  Covers: North-East Cobb County (Including <br/>\nparts of Woodstock, and Central Cobb County<br/>\n2. L.L.G. Area Two Group:  Covers: Pickens, Gilmer, and North <br/>\nCherokee Counties <br/>\n3. L.L.G.

Homeschooling Support Group caters to the diverse society <br/>\nwe live in, and all homeschooling families are welcome! However, our <br/>\nmembers prefer their religious and political beliefs not be a part of <br/>\nthe group&#39;s identity and purpose. We are in no way related with the <br/>\nSecular Humanists, nor are we anti-Christian, or any other religious <br/>\nor political belief, in any way. Our group is an eclectic mix of many <br/>\npersonal religious and political beliefs. Our main focus is to <br/>\nsupport learning lifestyles.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the group grows, we plan to continue incorporating many resources <br/>\nfor our members. These resources include: Weekly Social Days, a <br/>\nMember&#39;s Only Website (with Monthly Event Calendars and other <br/>\nhappenings within the group), our Monthly Newsletter, an &quot;Older Youth <br/>\nGroup&quot;, Group 4-H Club, Youth Book Clubs, Monthly Homeschooling <br/>\nInformation Night, Special group classes for youth members, field <br/>\ntrips, other events and activities, and more!  Field Trips are <br/>\nusually geared towards all age groups, however some events will be of <br/>\nmore interest to one age group than another. Children of all ages are <br/>\nwelcome in our group! <br/>\n<br/>\nOur group also meets year round so feel free to join us at any time!<br/>\n<br/>\nEach Area Group within L.L.G. has their own Monthly Calendar of <br/>\nEvents that includes Social Days, Field Trips, and Classes, as well <br/>\nas any special events done by that Area Group. The Older Youth Group, <br/>\n4-H Clubs, Book Clubs, Special Classes, and a variety of other <br/>\nactivities, are open to all members of L.L.G. regardless of your Area <br/>\nGroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo cover the costs of mailings, printings, and other expenses <br/>\ninvolved with maintaining the Support Group, we do collect a Yearly <br/>\nMembership Fee in the amount of $20.
