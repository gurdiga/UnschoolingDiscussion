Problem solved.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours isn&#39;t the only unschooling teen who&#39;s into hot metal and fire.  I&#39;ve <br/>\na 14 year old son and we&#39;re building a forge out of an old semi-truck brake <br/>\ndrum (or whatever it&#39;s called.)  Anyone have a squirrel-cage blower they <br/>\ndon&#39;t need anymore? (grin)  And, we just got our first Mig welder <br/>\n(harborfreight.com, about $200.)  We&#39;re going to need it to weld the legs <br/>\nonto the forge body... and weld the blower onto the bottom of the <br/>\ndrum.  Next on the wish list is an oxy/acet set with a cutting tip or two <br/>\n(plasma cutters are too expensive.)  (sigh/grin)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s been making chainmail on his own and next year will teach &#39;chainmail&#39; <br/>\nto some interested 5th graders.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the forge is up and functional, he wants to start knifemaking, mostly <br/>\nswords.  Folded metal and such.  I have the feeling it&#39;s going to require a <br/>\nmuch larger forge, but at least we&#39;ve helped him get started.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook, you&#39;re not alone.  Just do it and don&#39;t worry about it so <br/>\nmuch.  Support him.  Encourage him.  There&#39;s a farrier (horseshoes) around <br/>\nhere who makes more than $200 each time he shoes a horse.  I&#39;m sure he <br/>\npulls in six figures easy and everyone says he loves his work and does a <br/>\ngreat job.  Believe that your kid won&#39;t starve and he might just love what <br/>\nhe ends up doing.  What a life!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidiWD</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90203,"nextTopicId":4197}}
