They were all<br/>\n&gt; very much appreciated!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been thinking all day on my husband&#39;s job situation (feeling<br/>\n&gt; frustrated about it as usual) and wondered if any of you, being<br/>\n&gt; outside-the-box thinkers, might be able to offer any ideas.  I feel<br/>\n&gt; so helpless about the whole thing.  Dh was laid off in August of &#39;01<br/>\n&gt; and finally hired again in June of this year.  Those almost-two-years<br/>\n&gt; of unemployment brought major stress (compounded by the birth of my<br/>\n&gt; second son)into our home, as well as putting us FAR into debt.

And his<br/>\n&gt; bosses see it.  He works hard, but just can&#39;t reach the bar.  The<br/>\n&gt; thing is, at 38 years old, how do you switch into another career path<br/>\n&gt; without starting at square one?  When he was out of work we kept<br/>\n&gt; hearing, &quot;Well, why doesn&#39;t he get out of IT [the bottom fell out of<br/>\n&gt; IT especially]&quot; like it should be the easiest thing in the world, yet<br/>\n&gt; we found, as well as did others we knew out of work, that unless you<br/>\n&gt; had concrete experience in your field, you were out of contention.<br/>\n&gt; It didn&#39;t matter if you had the education or the ability; without<br/>\n&gt; experience to back it up, no one would take a chance on you.

We are so sick of corporate America <br/>\nwe could scream, but we don&#39;t know how to escape, with no savings, no <br/>\nreal assets, major debt, and two children to support.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, since I don&#39;t know any specifics about your personal situation, this is just general &#39;get back on your feet&#39; ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re way in debt, the first thing I would do is to downsize absolutely everything possible.  Less expensive housing, older cars, sell everything you don&#39;t absolutely need.  (This is all temporary, and can all be upgraded later.)  Talk to your debtors, in person if possible, and tell them what&#39;s going on.  A lot of the time they will cut, if not eliminate the interest owed, and may let you make tiny, &#39;good faith&#39; payments until things get better.  Some will even forgive large chunks of the debt.  Maybe talk to a credit counselor, they can sometimes help.  Bankruptcy (not a great option, but if there&#39;s no other way, there&#39;s no other way.  There IS life after bankruptcy, I am living proof.)  Is there anything you can do from home to help with the finances?  Crafts, sewing, computer work, selling on ebay, writing...anything you&#39;re skilled at is sellable.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~~The <br/>\nthing is, at 38 years old, how do you switch into another career path <br/>\nwithout starting at square one?~~<br/>\n<br/>\nWork for yourself.  Start a business.  Whatever he and you are good at, check into getting a grant for small businesses (which sometimes will cover living expenses while your business is getting off the ground), do some research in your area, demographics, and figure out what the area NEEDS, or even better than that, what your area people would WANT.  You&#39;d still be starting out at square one with your own business, but it would be YOUR square.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Dh <br/>\nwould be excellent in some sort of graphics work, even one of the <br/>\ncomputer-generated special effects shops (that would be like going to <br/>\nplay every day instead of work), but, how do we get there?~~<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know exactly, but I would start by talking to the people that are doing it now.  Go to the shops, get to know the people, use friends of friends to get your foot in the door.  Do some research to find out how to get there.  For something like graphics work, I&#39;ll bet that creativity and persistence speak louder than education and experience.  I&#39;m in the graphics business, and I know a few people that have years of experience, but very little talent.  They keep their jobs by being diligent and reliable, and someone else comes up with the creativity.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend that was stuck in a dead end job, hated it with a passion, and finally turned his back and walked away.  He was fairly good on a computer, fairly creative, and now has his own vinyl graphics shop.  He makes a ton of money creating vinyl decals you see on the sides of trucks and in store windows.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have another friend that started a trophy business and is doing VERY well.  All he does is assemble the trophy parts, engraves the little tags, and collects the money.  He works out of his garage, so he has very little overhead.  His customers come to him, he doesn&#39;t even advertise except for word of mouth, business cards, and a little tag with his company name on the bottom of every trophy he makes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDaycare can be a money maker, if you have the patience for it, lol.  I&#39;m not a big fan of daycare, but it&#39;s definitely something that is in need in most areas.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe someone will come up with something better.  There is always a way.  <br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Always remember, Lead By Example***<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n___________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign-up for Ads Free at Mail.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://promo.mail.com/adsfreejump.htm\">http://promo.mail.com/adsfreejump.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":134426484,"authorName":"kazzoozz","from":"&quot;kazzoozz&quot; &lt;hksarmina@...&gt;","profile":"kazzoozz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"thank you, and can anyone help with this one?","postDate":"1072771958","msgId":87071,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJzcmMxbSs1bDYyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":87080,"prevInTime":87070,"nextInTime":87072,"topicId":87071,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you to everyone who gave suggestions and thoughts in response to my question about helping my son learn to read.
