It included a <br/>\nspot on a company that buys fish from a large market. we talked about auctions <br/>\nand bidding, she talked to a woman lobster fisher; ds wanted to look for the <br/>\nbook she wrote. Martha cooked some live lobsters, ds was indignant that they <br/>\nwould suffer so, Martha said they did not feel it, we both talked about how it was <br/>\nstill cruel.He spent some time thinking of ways to humanely kill the <br/>\nlobsters. We thought of cool crafts he would like to do  inspired by thid show. all <br/>\nspent cuddling together. We live far from the ocean but ended feeling like we <br/>\nhad been there. <br/>\n<br/>\nlots of dialogue since then.<br/>\nSorry about the poor quality of typing, one hand still.
