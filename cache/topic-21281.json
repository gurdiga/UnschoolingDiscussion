I also went to college for art, but dropped out because I couldn&#39;t stomach the &quot;Starving Artist&quot; mentality on our campus. My husband was a high school dropout who got his GED and would have been considered hyperactive etc. also. He was sent to a &quot;troubled boy&quot; school during his jr high years.

I left high<br/>\n  school early without a diploma and got into college on the strength of my<br/>\n  SATs. Graduated Magna Cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa and all that happy hoo-ha<br/>\n  :-). Got a job (at Microsoft) in a field totally unrelated to my degree<br/>\n  (which was Art). Did not follow my passion (photography), though it has<br/>\n  always been a hobby I&#39;ve pursued.<br/>\n  OTOH, my husband was a high school &quot;failure&quot; who dropped out and then went<br/>\n  back and took his GED. He was &quot;hyperactive&quot; and a &quot;daydreamer&quot; (and probably<br/>\n  would&#39;ve been on Ritalin these days). But when he really wanted to study<br/>\n  something, he was brilliant (he got his pilot&#39;s license as a teenager with<br/>\n  no problem, and I can tell you that the written exam for that is a lot<br/>\n  tougher than anything you&#39;d see in a high school class). He went into the<br/>\n  Army for 10 years, then got his Associate&#39;s degree in aircraft maintenance<br/>\n  when he got out. Started his own aviation-related business in the evenings<br/>\n  while I worked the day shift.  Now his business is thriving, and he&#39;s<br/>\n  branched out into all sorts of other things that he&#39;s never done before<br/>\n  (right now he&#39;s being a contractor on his 2nd hangar-building project) and<br/>\n  I&#39;m a SAHM. So I guess you could say he&#39;s &quot;unjobbing&quot; as he loves owning his<br/>\n  own business and deciding what kind of work he wants to do. Along the way,<br/>\n  he&#39;s learned everything he needed to know that he didn&#39;t learn in school.<br/>\n  One night, for instance, we went over fractions together because he hadn&#39;t<br/>\n  retained that from school. Which just shows you that when you really need<br/>\n  and want to learn something, it&#39;s usually a snap to pick it up. He can do<br/>\n  fractions in his head now much faster than I can, because he uses them a lot<br/>\n  on a daily basis. Yet the math score on my SAT test was probably double of<br/>\n  his. So what does a test tell you about anything?? diddly squat.<br/>\n<br/>\n  From these two disparate experiences, we have both come to the conclusion<br/>\n  that our schooling did not serve us well, did not teach us the lessons we<br/>\n  truly needed to know, and was a monumental waste of time and energy, not to<br/>\n  mention emotionally and mentally crippling. We both feel fortunate that we<br/>\n  were able to break the chains on our imaginations and let our lives carry us<br/>\n  to where we wanted to be. We feel that it is the birthright of our children<br/>\n  not to have to go through that humiliating and debilitating experience that<br/>\n  is commonly called &quot;public education&quot;. We love to travel and plan to spend a<br/>\n  lot of our kids&#39; unschooling years in different locales, flying our airplane<br/>\n  around, or in different countries. For us, the road to unschooling started<br/>\n  with questioning the commonly accepted notions of hospital birth, and the<br/>\n  decision to birth with a midwife outside of a hospital led us to attachment<br/>\n  parenting, extended nursing, and to a host of alternative child-rearing<br/>\n  practices, culminating in the vision of a life in which learning is an<br/>\n  integral part and not a drudgery imposed from without.
