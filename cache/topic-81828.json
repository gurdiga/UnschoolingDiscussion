The point is not to provide support and fun.  The point is a very<br/>\nspecific religious agenda.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I thank all that is divine for our experience with the local<br/>\nChristian support group.  I have discovered that I am actually Pagan.  I had<br/>\nalways thought I was a Christian, that I just didn&#39;t agree with most of the<br/>\nteachings.  After the zillionth time of hearing about how I must do such and<br/>\nsuch because that is what Christains do, I finally responded &quot;Perhaps I&#39;m<br/>\nnot Christian.  I always thought I was but maybe not because what I have<br/>\nalways had in my heart that I thought was God is nothing like what you<br/>\ndescribe.&quot;  It caused a sharp intake of breath by the listener and it opened<br/>\na floodgate within me.  I started researching and finding that large groups<br/>\nof people believe the same as me, see the world as I have always seen it.<br/>\nIt is so liberating.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.---never happier</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81827,"nextTopicId":81829}}
