Dreams aren&#39;t messages from God or <br/>\ndevils.  Being in love isn&#39;t a conscious decision people make, it&#39;s a <br/>\nbiochemical change that has to do with mating and nesting and reproduction, and it <br/>\nDOES fade (but can be replaced with another kind of devotion and love).  Recent <br/>\nstudies have found the part ofthe brain where &quot;religious experiences&quot; are. The <br/>\nfeeling of connectedness to everyone has a spot in the brain where certain <br/>\nchanges can take place in connection with religious experiences.  It&#39;s like an <br/>\norgasm of sorts.  And people have explained them in similar ways for centuries <br/>\n(or longer).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen water mirages in the desert.  It&#39;s not real water but it sure looks <br/>\nlike it.<br/>\nI&#39;ve had deja vu.  It doesn&#39;t mean the thing actually happened before.  It&#39;s <br/>\nlike a brain-mirage.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty is the only one in our family who&#39;s ever really had an interest in the <br/>\nCivil War.  Keith never much cared. I never did. Kirby and Holly didn&#39;t spark <br/>\nto it.   I&#39;m interested in Marty&#39;s interest and we&#39;ve found details and trivia <br/>\nfor each other.    It doesn&#39;t prove that Marty&#39;s is a reincarnated Civil War <br/>\nparticipant/victim/witness.   It&#39;s just an interest.  It might peter out soon, <br/>\nor he might be a scholar or a moviemaker or novelist or he might just have <br/>\nthat interest all his life.  The model of the universe in his head will have <br/>\nmore civil war detail than some folks&#39;, and less than others.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s a way  he makes connections, and what has inspired his curiosity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no benefit to making it bigger than it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97743,"nextTopicId":97776}}
