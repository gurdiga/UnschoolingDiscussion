We&#39;ll have orders by the end of the day...we&#39;re looking at most likely somewhere in Michigan. <br/>\n <br/>\nAt our last move, Sarah was turning 5; Logan was a year old, and Megan was not yet born. <br/>\n <br/>\nAny helpful ideas to help them all deal with the move?! I was thinking that I&#39;d throw Sarah a surprise &quot;We&#39;ll Miss You!&quot; party with her friends....have them do up an address book with their names and addresses, give Sarah a nice stationary set, take pictures for an album...There is also a badge she can earn through Girl Scouts that has lots of activities to do learning about where we&#39;re going, etc. that might help her as well....<br/>\n <br/>\nNot at all sure what to do for Logan or Megan; I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be a big deal to Gracie. <br/>\n<br/>\nMegan I&#39;m especially worried about because she doesn&#39;t take to change easily. I can see her getting upset when the movers come..I may need to just take the kids to Dazie&#39;s Place that day (an indoor all day play place) or something while they&#39;re packing us up...To a large degree I think she&#39;ll be ok as long as she is with us, but I&#39;m not sure how she&#39;ll react to a new house...<br/>\n <br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
