And most likely, we will just all pitch in and <br/>\ntake turns staying.   4 daughters, 2 sons, .. at least 8 grandchildren ( <br/>\nwilling to stay, maybe more.. out of 17 still living).. thats two weeks worth <br/>\nright there.. So, we would only have to stay once every two weeks. Or two <br/>\nnights a month..  The only  &quot;bad&quot; thing about rotating, taking turns. so many <br/>\nfolks coming in and out.. Grandma would never rest or feel &quot;settled&quot;  She is <br/>\nvery difficult to &quot;take care of&quot;  she insists on taking care of everyone <br/>\nelse.. Im afraid Grandma would constantly be in a state of &quot;hostess&quot;  <br/>\nAlthough she may not..  That perception is based on her attitudes and <br/>\nbehaviors before Grandpa died.. She may let other folks care for her during <br/>\nher grief.   Its hard to say though.. After the funeral, her biggest concern <br/>\nwas that everyone got something to eat.. <br/>\n&#39;<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2997","postDate":"1044477217","msgId":57981,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNjcxRTE3LjFEOTIlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNDQ0NjkwODMuMjA2Mi44NDg3Mi5tMTRAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":57983,"prevInTime":57980,"nextInTime":57982,"topicId":57981,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
