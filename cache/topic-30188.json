Very<br/>\nheart-wrenching....but it helped as I am still filled with grief,<br/>\nespecially with the holidays.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes Yes!!  a little background first...<br/>\nI taught myself to read at 5.  I began reading to my<br/>\ndaughter while she was in the womb.<br/>\nBy the time she was a year old she had 3 libraries,<br/>\nEnglish, Italian and Spanish.  It was a huge thorn<br/>\nin my side that she couldn&#39;t read.  I got more and more<br/>\nfrustrated.  Wasted more and more money on stuff like<br/>\nHooked on Phonics ,etc.  Finally realized she did not want<br/>\nto read.  That was even harder to accept. But on her 10th<br/>\nbirthday she decided she did want to read and has been<br/>\ngoing strong ever since.  EXCEPT... Here she is reading all<br/>\nsorts of books and comprehending and writing the best darn<br/>\nbook reports, etc but she has the worst spelling.  I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t understand how she could read so well and spell so<br/>\npoorly.  But one day recently I realized we work on her<br/>\nspelling via phonics and with her accent she simply can&#39;t<br/>\nhear half the vowels.<br/>\nShe was born in Massachusetts, on the South Shore.  Not<br/>\nonly does she not hear vowels in some cases she doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhear consonants either!  For instance the word -better-.<br/>\nShe honestly hears -beDDer-.  She drops letters at the ends<br/>\nof words adds some on to others - it&#39;s SOooo frustrating -<br/>\nfor both of us.  To make matters worse by the time she was<br/>\n4 she was in a speech therapy class for almost 2 years,<br/>\nbeing taught by a woman with an even worse accent than dd<br/>\nalready had!  Now the stuff is ingrained.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30169,"nextTopicId":30209}}
