I&#39;d like him to write about Matt now and<br/>\nthen if other things come up in the future that would make it better, I can<br/>\nalways ask for another letter later.

I think it&#39;s wonderful you <br/>\nare able to do all this for your daughter.  IMHO you should go as far as <br/>\nshe&#39;s willing to go.  Just follow her lead and do what you can do to <br/>\nhelp her follow her interests.  If her interest is in sales, I <br/>\npersonally, don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with that.  Just by <br/>\nhelping her write these books, I&#39;m sure you have been fostering her <br/>\nartistic nature all along.  Isn&#39;t writing an artistic venture?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, just because she wants to make money doesn&#39;t automatically mean <br/>\nshe is or will be materialistic.  IMO, wanting to make money is not a <br/>\nbad thing.  A lot of good can be done with money.  It can bring a lot of <br/>\nhappiness.
