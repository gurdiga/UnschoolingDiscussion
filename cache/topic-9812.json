And I do have to include the<br/>\ndads in this diatribe!  They are just as much at blame for allowing their<br/>\nkids to be raised by someone else.&lt;SNIP&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so steamed. What a generalization! &quot;Most mothers... so they can pursue <br/>\ntheir own desires&quot;!? Many people do choose to work or have to work (this is <br/>\nimpossible to judge since everyone has different standards about what is <br/>\nnecessary) and look long and hard for reliable and loving day care, whether <br/>\nit&#39;s someone in the home or an outside provider. Such a thing is possible; I <br/>\nhave seen it, and I have seen well-adjusted and happy families and kids in <br/>\nthat situation. Not always happy, of course, but who is, and of course, if <br/>\nyou have a counseling practice, you are going to see the more dysfunctional <br/>\nfamilies.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we want to go back to being hunter-gatherers, the whole family was there <br/>\nall the time, ie grandma, grandpa, aunts and uncles, and yes, mom AND dad. <br/>\nThink of how we are depriving our children, then, by denying them the <br/>\nconstant presence of an extended family numbering in the dozens. How on <br/>\nearth does our emotional health stand it?<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, life is a balance. Sometimes, parents&#39; needs do take precedence <br/>\nover those of the children. (I do NOT feel guilty about a night out with my <br/>\nhusband, except that I know the sitter will be a limp rag by the time we get <br/>\nhome..!) Mostly, the children do come first, especially when they&#39;re little. <br/>\nBut you can&#39;t make blanket judgments about other people&#39;s unique situations. <br/>\nWell, you could, but you&#39;d be  wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9809,"nextTopicId":9719}}
