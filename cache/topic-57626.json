God could <br/>\nprevent this; why doesn’t He do it? God’s Word mentions two reasons … God <br/>\npermits it partly to test His children, partly to punish unthankful hearers. <br/>\nPaul says to the Corinthians: ‘For there must be also heresies among you, <br/>\nthat they which are approved may be made manifest among you.’ (I Cor. 11:19) <br/>\nIf the treasure of the pure doctrine would not be attacked, it never would <br/>\nbecome really clear to what one should hold fast. But if false teachers <br/>\nappear, it will become clear who is faithful to the pure Word; the faith of <br/>\nthe upright is then tested and proven.

This means that<br/>\npart of your work as a parent is to keep growing in self-knowledge and<br/>\nawareness. This ongoing work can be furthered by making a time for quiet<br/>\ncontemplation in whatever ways feel comfortable to us. We only have right<br/>\nnow.
