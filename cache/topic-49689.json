We <br/>\ntalk about genetics and ancestry but more from an interest point of <br/>\nview.  We one time had a discussion of ethnic history. One dd doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike that the ethnic heritage that she has the least interest in is the <br/>\none that is the largest % of her genetic makeup. We discussed how that <br/>\ndidn&#39;t matter - adopt the heritage or country you are most interested in <br/>\nand learn about that, be part of that if you want. Choose one that isn&#39;t <br/>\n&quot;you&quot; if you want. However, while hubby is of only one ethnic <br/>\nbackground, a friend once joked that my family tree looked like the UN. <br/>\n&lt;lol&gt; - so it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to find things. Other dd is <br/>\ninterested in all things Jewish, and is very drawn to Jewish culture and <br/>\nholidays. It turns out that I have a Jewish great-aunt, (not a &quot;blood&quot; <br/>\nrelative) who lived in Brooklyn. Good enough.  The other part is, we <br/>\nhave three children who are biological, the two step-children are both <br/>\nadopted.

I&#39;m so glad you got to meet your half-brother. My mom has two of them, and they seem more like &quot;real family&quot; than her other two full brothers do. Thanks for the ps part too!! That&#39;s the kind of info I&#39;m looking for!<br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: wanderingmommy <br/>\n  My story might be interesting to you. I never knew my biological <br/>\n  father (I&#39;ll call him &quot;bf&quot;). My mom married my stepdad when I was an <br/>\n  infant. My parentage was not a secret but it was not a hot topic <br/>\n  either. People often say I look just like my mom, only blonde haired <br/>\n  and blue eyed (from bf), but the truth is the similarity is due more <br/>\n  to voice, mannerisms and personality. However, I&#39;m am also definitely <br/>\n  my father&#39;s (stepdad) daughter. I share his out-spoken nature (some <br/>\n  say tactless; consider yourself forewarned &lt;beg&gt;), his perfectionism <br/>\n  and, strangely enough, his poor eyesight.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My stepdads family has never treated my as anything other than his <br/>\n  true daughter. So much so that many of my relatives have forgotten <br/>\n  that I was not his biological child. And to complicate matters even <br/>\n  more, I actually DO share his (my stepdads) genetics in a sort of <br/>\n  round about way through my cousins. My mom&#39;s brother married my <br/>\n  stepdads sister, so my aunt and uncle and their children are related <br/>\n  to me on both sides of my family. People often say my cousins and I <br/>\n  are more like sisters; we look and act very much alike even though <br/>\n  they really bear a resemblance to my STEPDADS side of the family.<br/>\n<br/>\n  After I had children I became suddenly interested in knowing more <br/>\n  about my ancestry (anyone else experience this?) and I recently <br/>\n  decided to see if I could locate my bf, just for curiosity&#39;s sake. I <br/>\n  had one picture of my bf and thought my ds, who doesn&#39;t really look <br/>\n  like anyone else in the family, bore a resemblance to him. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I ended up in contact with an aunt and a half-brother I didn&#39;t know I <br/>\n  had. Here&#39;s another interesting piece of the story. A few months ago <br/>\n  I got to speak with my newly found half-brother (we&#39;re both 40yo btw, <br/>\n  another interesting tidbit) and we share many PERSONALITY traits! And <br/>\n  he says our bf also shares some of those traits (turns out that my bf <br/>\n  also did the same thing to my half brother&#39;s mom, married her then <br/>\n  skipped town leaving her with an infant to raise).<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, where does nature end and nurture begin? If anyone suggested to <br/>\n  my stepdads family that I wasn&#39;t really his daughter because I didn&#39;t <br/>\n  share his genes they would call that person nuts! It&#39;s so obvious to <br/>\n  anyone who knows us that I am his daughter because we seem to share <br/>\n  so much, both personality-wise and physically.

It isn&#39;t that you look girlish in any other way; but an elderly person, for instance, seeing your long hair, but unable to distinguish your features, may call you a girl, or refer to you as a girl, because your hair is the most significant feature.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong hair held in a ponytail (and very little hair any where else) and fairly big ones on the chest, but my manner,  I guess, often made me appear, to others, especially the elderly, like a boy.  What can I do?  I am me, and your son is himself.  Let him know that what someone else sees him as is not who he is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPresentation is important sometimes, but does anyone remember that story of the gorgeous cake that turned out to be a pasteboard display in a shop?  If you are interested in it, I will try and find the name of the story and perhaps you could read it to him.   Point being what I said above.  He shouldn&#39;t feel upset or angered by the judgement of others....<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is more important, imho, than the string of foul words that come out, but a symptom of his feeling judged....<br/>\n<br/>\nbe well,<br/>\nRachel Ann<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Shyrley <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, November 12, 2002 5:40 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Red heads - was Is It Normal?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  On 12 Nov 02, at 14:33, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kevin.tucker@...\">kevin.tucker@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s only red hair.
