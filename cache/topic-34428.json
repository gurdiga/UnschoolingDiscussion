It doesn&#39;t matter that my opinion<br/>\nhas raised two bright, inquisitive, daring, funny and smart kids.

It&#39;s for discussing how kids learn <br/>\nwithout being taught, without lessons, without a curriculum.  And children <br/>\ncan and do learn that way.  So, if people want to talk about that this will <br/>\nbe a really great place for them.  And if they want to display the chip on <br/>\ntheir shoulder and insult other people and display their defensiveness, it <br/>\nwill not be much fun for them OR the rest of the readers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe breathe deeply, and don&#39;t post everything you think.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34425,"nextTopicId":34399}}
