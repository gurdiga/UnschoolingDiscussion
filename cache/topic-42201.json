What helped him most was for me to take him out of school and all <br/>\nthose special programs and to stop focusing on his learning to read for <br/>\nawhile. I took off all the pressure when he came home from school and just <br/>\nlet him be. I did still continue reading to him, though, because he enjoyed <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce he realized we weren&#39;t going to force anymore reading lessons or check <br/>\nis fluency or grade level anymore, he was able to relax. Eventually he <br/>\nstarted casually looking through stuff to read around the house, magazines, <br/>\nold children&#39;s books, game cards, newspapers and LOTS of comics. He is 13 <br/>\nnow and reads just fine for purpose or pleasure. I couldn&#39;t tell you what <br/>\ngrade level he&#39;s at because I no longer check such things.

He feels very <br/>\n&gt;&gt;stupid and it has become an emotional block.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds like he needs to come home and deschool for awhile. There are so many <br/>\nthings a 14 year old can be doing and learning that don&#39;t require him to <br/>\nread. He has plenty of time to get the rest of those reading skills in <br/>\nplace. What he needs now is time to heal from the damage all those labels <br/>\nhave done to his sense of Who He Is and what he&#39;s capable of doing and <br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I am afraid I will do him a disservice.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve said he already feels stupid and hasn&#39;t been learning anything in <br/>\npublic school. How could you possibly do worse than that? He wants to come <br/>\nhome to learn. He wants you, who understands how smart he really is, to help <br/>\nhim. That&#39;s not a disservice. It&#39;s throwing him a lifeline.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Does anyone have suggestions on curriculum?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, we&#39;re unschoolers here so we don&#39;t use curriculums. :o) But we do use <br/>\nlife and that&#39;s the biggest curriculum there is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best advice is to bring him home and let him decompress and deschool. You <br/>\ncan keep reading here and at unschooling.com for ideas on how to help him <br/>\nease out of school and back into real life.<br/>\nThe book Right Brained Children in a Left Brained World by Jeffrey Freed <br/>\nmight also shed some different light on his learning style and reading <br/>\nabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can do this. You can help him regain his sense of self and his natural <br/>\nlove of learning.

If reading is a big<br/>\ndifficulty for him, he can learn a lot (at home) from books on tape,<br/>\nvideos, or things you read to him. And, of course, he can learn a lot<br/>\nfrom going places and doing things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve just been reading a book called The First Year Homeschooling Your<br/>\nChild, by Linda Dobson.  I think it&#39;s a very reassuring book.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also know that Lenore Colacion Hayes has written a book about<br/>\nhomeschooling kids with special needs.  I haven&#39;t had a reason to read<br/>\nthis book, and I don&#39;t know the exact title, but Lenore is very<br/>\nknowledgeable and experienced and a cool unschooler, so I have to figure<br/>\nthis is a cool book.  (I think it&#39;s the very first book ever written<br/>\nabout homeschooling kids with special needs.  It&#39;s certainly the only<br/>\none I have ever seen, so it fills a real need.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go to the unschooling.com message boards there&#39;s lots of good<br/>\nadvice archived there, and  you can search by keyword to focus on the<br/>\ninformation you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] HELP PLEASE","postDate":"1030473185","msgId":42205,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5OTEzRTIxLkMzQUIlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDI2OTc0LTNENkJCRUZGLTgxODlAc3RvcmVmdWxsLTIzNzUucHVibGljLmxhd3Nvbi53ZWJ0di5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":42204,"nextInTopic":42220,"prevInTime":42204,"nextInTime":42206,"topicId":42201,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"on 8/27/02 2:03 PM, michele-nappi@webtv.net at michele-nappi@webtv.net ...

He feels very","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1257429942\">My 14 year old son has dyslexia - phonically aware and fluency at 4th<br/>\ngrade level. Public school has basically taught him nothing for years.<br/>\nHe feels very stupid and it has become an emotional block. He is<br/>\ncurrently enrolled in a therapeutic school and doesn&#39;t want to go. He<br/>\nhas only gone for 3 hours:) I am teaching my 11 year old at home for the<br/>\nfirst time. My 14 year old wants me to teach him at home. I am afraid I<br/>\nwill do him a disservice. Does anyone have suggestions on curriculum?<br/>\nAny helpful ideas welcome. Thank you.
