It is well-documented<br/>\nthat infants&#39; breathing patterns change in response to vaccinations, so<br/>\nwhy wouldn&#39;t an older child have difficulty too?  The whole system is<br/>\naffected after innoculation with immune deficiencies (illness, allergies<br/>\netc.), neurological changes and even developmental delays to name a<br/>\nfew.  Some homeopaths and chiropractors can help reverse some of the<br/>\ndamage and help the body and nervous system get back on track after<br/>\nvaccinations.  Do some research and/or look up Dr. Vera Scheibner who is<br/>\nan internationally-reknown physician/research scientist who has reams of<br/>\nmaterial, scientific data and information about the negative effects<br/>\nfrom vaccinations.

I know I should not give him his way, as I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want him to be the center of the family, or push everyone around.<br/>\nHowever I am not sure how to handle these episodes.  Sometimes it is an<br/>\nepisode of screaming and kicking and out of control behavior during the day.<br/>\nMore often though, it is at bedtime.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Until recently, bedtime was not too big a deal.  He would go to bed<br/>\n </span></blockquote>without much fuss and would play quietly until he dropped off to sleep.<br/>\nLately he has begun to kick and scream and to run and hide when it&#39;s<br/>\nbedtime.  Once in his room he screams and cries hysterically, trashes his<br/>\nroom, and lies in bed kicking his wall.  In general he makes a huge amount<br/>\nof noise, makes a big mess and upsets everyone in the house.  This goes on<br/>\nfor up to two hours at a time, and we are quickly losing our patience after<br/>\nabout a week of this.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I make him clean up the mess in the morning (although he needs a bit of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>help to keep him directed and focused.)  We also go in to talk to him<br/>\nseveral times while he is having his tantrum.  We tell him he is disturbing<br/>\neveryone in the house, we put certain toys in time out, we beg and plead,<br/>\nbut short of tying him down I don&#39;t know what else to do.  He usually says<br/>\nthat he wants to sleep with us, and we tell him that we are not in bed yet,<br/>\nbut if he is still awake when we go to bed, he can go with us.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night he was up throwing a tantrum until midnight.  When he finally<br/>\n </span></blockquote>quieted down, we went to bed.  I have a pretty bad cold and am feeling<br/>\npretty lousy.  Tom told Thomas that Mommy was sick and he could not come to<br/>\nbed with us because I was all achey and I did not want to be breathing all<br/>\nover him all night.  Well, he woke up again around 2am and started<br/>\nscreaming.  He often has nightmares, so we brought him to bed with us.  He<br/>\nproceeded to wiggle and giggle until we got fed up and put him back to bed<br/>\naround 4:30am.  He promptly began kicking his door, and the wall.  Tom had<br/>\nto threaten to put him in time out all day tomorrow (today) if he didn&#39;t<br/>\nquiet down and let us and his brother sleep.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am worried that this might be allergy related, but I cannot isolate a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>probable cause for it.

I&#39;m sure that most of you know by now <br/>\n&gt;about my eldest boy and all his allergies, etc.  Thomas (almost 4) is <br/>\n&gt;hyperactive, hypersensative (sensory - no clothes tags, likes to be <br/>\n&gt;touched or touch someone constantly, etc)  and hyper-emotional.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My problem is this:  He has recently developed a tendancy to have <br/>\n&gt;these pretty impressive tantrums.  I know I should not give him his <br/>\n&gt;way, as I don&#39;t want him to be the center of the family, or push <br/>\n&gt;everyone around.  However I am not sure how to handle these episodes.  <br/>\n&gt;Sometimes it is an episode of screaming and kicking and out of control <br/>\n&gt;behavior during the day.  More often though, it is at bedtime.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Until recently, bedtime was not too big a deal.  He would go to bed <br/>\n&gt;without much fuss and would play quietly until he dropped off to <br/>\n&gt;sleep.  Lately he has begun to kick and scream and to run and hide <br/>\n&gt;when it&#39;s bedtime.  Once in his room he screams and cries <br/>\n&gt;hysterically, trashes his room, and lies in bed kicking his wall.  In <br/>\n&gt;general he makes a huge amount of noise, makes a big mess and upsets <br/>\n&gt;everyone in the house.  This goes on for up to two hours at a time, <br/>\n&gt;and we are quickly losing our patience after about a week of this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I make him clean up the mess in the morning (although he needs a bit <br/>\n&gt;of help to keep him directed and focused.)  We also go in to talk to <br/>\n&gt;him several times while he is having his tantrum.  We tell him he is <br/>\n&gt;disturbing everyone in the house, we put certain toys in time out, we <br/>\n&gt;beg and plead, but short of tying him down I don&#39;t know what else to <br/>\n&gt;do.  He usually says that he wants to sleep with us, and we tell him <br/>\n&gt;that we are not in bed yet, but if he is still awake when we go to <br/>\n&gt;bed, he can go with us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Last night he was up throwing a tantrum until midnight.  When he <br/>\n&gt;finally quieted down, we went to bed.  I have a pretty bad cold and am <br/>\n&gt;feeling pretty lousy.  Tom told Thomas that Mommy was sick and he <br/>\n&gt;could not come to bed with us because I was all achey and I did not <br/>\n&gt;want to be breathing all over him all night.  Well, he woke up again <br/>\n&gt;around 2am and started screaming.  He often has nightmares, so we <br/>\n&gt;brought him to bed with us.  He proceeded to wiggle and giggle until <br/>\n&gt;we got fed up and put him back to bed around 4:30am.  He promptly <br/>\n&gt;began kicking his door, and the wall.  Tom had to threaten to put him <br/>\n&gt;in time out all day tomorrow (today) if he didn&#39;t quiet down and let <br/>\n&gt;us and his brother sleep.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am worried that this might be allergy related, but I cannot isolate <br/>\n&gt;a probable cause for it.  Any ideas??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Nanci K.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Show off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\n&gt;Sign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-------------------------- eGroups Sponsor <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt;Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Addresses:<br/>\n&gt;Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\nTry it today - there&#39;s no risk!

Sometimes it is an<br/>\nepisode of screaming and kicking and out of control behavior during the day.<br/>\nMore often though, it is at bedtime.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a 4 y.o. also who sounds similar to yours. My son has Sensory<br/>\nIntegration issues, is hypersensitive to touch, etc. and has allergy<br/>\nproblems as well (he&#39;s had hives for 2 months now and so far we have not<br/>\nbeen able to pinpoint it, despite elimination diets, testing, etc.). So I<br/>\ncan sympathize!!!<br/>\nOn the sleep issue - can you be with him physically until he goes to sleep?<br/>\nRock, sing, hug, or whatever works best for him. Although he sleeps in his<br/>\nown bed, I still mother my son to sleep every night. He is still nursing at<br/>\nbedtime, so that makes it much easier I would guess. Often he will ask for a<br/>\nsong as well. A bedtime routine that includes pleasing things can make the<br/>\ntransition easier. I&#39;ve found that songs, routines, and rhythms go a long<br/>\nway towards making transitions easier for my spirited son. Our bedimte<br/>\nroutine is that he plays a game with his dad while I get his sister to<br/>\nsleep, gets his PJs on and brushes teeth (along with the teethbrushing<br/>\nsong). Then he and I go out and look at the stars, moon, sky together. We<br/>\ncome inside and sometimes he requests his &quot;rocking song&quot;, where I will hold<br/>\nhim and dance to &quot;10,000 Miles&quot; by Mary Chapin Carpenter (his favorite<br/>\nsong). We go upstairs and he picks out a story to read, and then sometimes<br/>\nasks me to tell him a story on my own too. Then I sing him a lullabye and<br/>\nnurse him to sleep. Even if he is done nursing, I remain lying down with him<br/>\nin his bed until he is completely asleep. I&#39;d guess the whole routine takes<br/>\nabout 20 - 30 minutes. He is always free to come into our bed in the night,<br/>\nprovided he&#39;s quiet so that the rest of us aren&#39;t too disturbed. It sounds<br/>\nlike your son may be asking (albeit in a very roundabout way) for more<br/>\ncompany at bedtime (a hard transition time for many kids).<br/>\nOther things that help my son are deep tissue work - we make sure we do some<br/>\nevery day. We play a game called &quot;The Sandwich&quot; where he lies down on a<br/>\npillow (the &quot;bread&quot;) and I &quot;spread&quot; mustard, relish, etc. on him with my<br/>\nhands, using deep strokes down his back, arms, and legs going away from his<br/>\nhead. Then I put the other pillow &quot;bread&quot; on top and lay down on top of him.<br/>\nDeep touch can really help kids with sensory issues, we got some good<br/>\nsuggestions from the book &quot;The Out-Of-Sync Child&quot;. Taking him off of all<br/>\ndairy and minimizing wheat glutens in his diet has also gone a very long way<br/>\ntowards helping his sensory problems.<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;d have to say that I&#39;ve found time-outs and other punishments to be<br/>\nlargely ineffective tools when dealing with behavior of this sort, because<br/>\nthey address what is happening at the surface, but not what is going on<br/>\nunderneath. Is there any way you can get to the root of what is bothering<br/>\nhim? It could be that if his sensory problems and allergies are problematic<br/>\nenough that he just plain feels out of control in his own body. That can be<br/>\nterribly frightening and kids of this age tend to lash out when frightened.<br/>\nCan you be present with him and attempt to mirror his emotions verbally so<br/>\nthat he eventually has better tools for explaining himself? Is there<br/>\nsomething that you can do to help him self-soothe - a special song you sing<br/>\njust at these times? A certain way of rocking or holding? Is there any other<br/>\napproaches you can use in helping him get control of his sensory issues? We<br/>\nare looking for an Occupational Therapist right now for our own son, I know<br/>\nmany parents have felt that it really helped their kids feel more<br/>\ncomfortable in their own bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck, I know that sometimes when there are so many &quot;issues&quot;<br/>\n(allergy, sensitivity, etc.) you have to deal with, parenting becomes just<br/>\nplain exhausting.

I was telling her how mine used to do that, but he stopped suddenly <br/>\nwhen he was two.  Well, the very next day he started again and went on for a <br/>\nyear or slightly more.  He was almost four.  These fits just stopped about a <br/>\nmonth ago and for the life of me, I don&#39;t know why.  We never gave in to his <br/>\ntantrums.  We couldn&#39;t give him time outs because he would harm his room and <br/>\nmaybe himself in the process.  We couldn&#39;t give his things a time out because <br/>\nhe would get worse and try to get them back.  In public he would control <br/>\nhimself because we would go home if he didn&#39;t and he knew that.  In private, <br/>\nwe tried everything to no avail.  What we did do was ignore most of it.  Once <br/>\nhe started, we just tuned out and went on with our lives not paying any <br/>\nattention to him.  If he got physical, we would physically restrain him in a <br/>\ncorner or a chair while letting him know we could not allow him to hurt <br/>\nanyone or anything, but it was perfectly okay for him to go on screaming if <br/>\nthat was what he needed.  The difference in our situations is that our son <br/>\nwould throw fits because of something he wanted and not because of something <br/>\nwe wanted him to do.  He wouldn&#39;t understand that something had to be <br/>\ntomorrow and not today, or that he couldn&#39;t be the only one to take a bath.  <br/>\nIf we wanted him to do something he didn&#39;t want to do, we would usually sit <br/>\ndown and work out a compromise.  Sort of like people do with me when I don&#39;t <br/>\nreally want to do something.  In exchange for a haircut he didn&#39;t want, we <br/>\nwould go on an extra park visit or whatever we decided would be a fair trade <br/>\noff.  He never had a bedtime, so I can&#39;t tell you from experience what to do <br/>\nthere, but would it be possible to let him stay up?  If he is up early with <br/>\neveryone, his body should tell him to go to sleep at the needed time.  Maybe <br/>\nyou could let him watch a tape until he falls asleep on his own.  I&#39;ve always <br/>\nbeen a night owl, so we&#39;re up late and sleep in late, but ds&#39; body still <br/>\nschedules ten to twelve hours sleep for him, without anyone telling him he <br/>\nneeds it.  If we happen to have to be up early, he ends up falling asleep <br/>\nearlier that evening.  Anyway, I don&#39;t know how much help I&#39;ve been, but I <br/>\nwanted you to know you&#39;re not alone and maybe it&#39;s just a phase he needs to <br/>\ngo through.  Mine still gets upset, but the difference is like night and day.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheryl<br/>\nNicholas Academy Homeschooling Resources<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nicholasacademy.homestead.com\">http://nicholasacademy.homestead.com</a><br/>\nGet paid for your opinion:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nicholasacademy.epinions.com\">http://nicholasacademy.epinions.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"DanaEugKeanen@aol.com","from":"DanaEugKeanen@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"5sfumE-lw_OEcY8KA4CgFXQZEXcYdeCRrtCPu-FhKytf4Rt21EVylVUgPIJ2gIAzIjLks67AdfLznHOF","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] HELP!!!","postDate":"973108419","msgId":13900,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU2LjJiNTUyZDIuMjczMWNlYzNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":13895,"nextInTopic":13903,"prevInTime":13899,"nextInTime":13901,"topicId":13891,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hmmn, I guess he d keep the little one awake - but you might give it a try anyway?

I&#39;m sure that most of you know by now about my eldest boy and all his allergies, etc.  Thomas (almost 4) is hyperactive, hypersensative (sensory - no clothes tags, likes to be touched or touch someone constantly, etc)  and hyper-emotional.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is this:  He has recently developed a tendancy to have these pretty impressive tantrums.  I know I should not give him his way, as I don&#39;t want him to be the center of the family, or push everyone around.  However I am not sure how to handle these episodes.  Sometimes it is an episode of screaming and kicking and out of control behavior during the day.  More often though, it is at bedtime.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUntil recently, bedtime was not too big a deal.  He would go to bed without much fuss and would play quietly until he dropped off to sleep.  Lately he has begun to kick and scream and to run and hide when it&#39;s bedtime.  Once in his room he screams and cries hysterically, trashes his room, and lies in bed kicking his wall.  In general he makes a huge amount of noise, makes a big mess and upsets everyone in the house.  This goes on for up to two hours at a time, and we are quickly losing our patience after about a week of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI make him clean up the mess in the morning (although he needs a bit of help to keep him directed and focused.)  We also go in to talk to him several times while he is having his tantrum.  We tell him he is disturbing everyone in the house, we put certain toys in time out, we beg and plead, but short of tying him down I don&#39;t know what else to do.  He usually says that he wants to sleep with us, and we tell him that we are not in bed yet, but if he is still awake when we go to bed, he can go with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night he was up throwing a tantrum until midnight.  When he finally quieted down, we went to bed.  I have a pretty bad cold and am feeling pretty lousy.  Tom told Thomas that Mommy was sick and he could not come to bed with us because I was all achey and I did not want to be breathing all over him all night.  Well, he woke up again around 2am and started screaming.  He often has nightmares, so we brought him to bed with us.  He proceeded to wiggle and giggle until we got fed up and put him back to bed around 4:30am.  He promptly began kicking his door, and the wall.  Tom had to threaten to put him in time out all day tomorrow (today) if he didn&#39;t quiet down and let us and his brother sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am worried that this might be allergy related, but I cannot isolate a probable cause for it.  Any ideas??<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14311,"nextTopicId":14313}}
