My favorite by far is to remind the questioner that everyone <br/>\nhas something to show us, because our world is where we learn,  so if you <br/>\nare really concerned my kids need something, plan to hang out with them. <br/>\nShow them what you are afraid they are missing. Allowing my once skeptical <br/>\nfamily to also facilitate in our adventure has shown the family my kids have <br/>\nmeaningful questions, they think, they talk, they make eye contact. They <br/>\nknow how to play at the park and order from menues. They can help with <br/>\nlittle kids and set a table.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m having my own struggle with other ps kids not treating my kids too well. <br/>\nI&#39;m using the same comments to them, even telling the worst of the bunch <br/>\nthings like your baby sisters teach us things. These girls are barely 4 <br/>\nmonths and were premature. Everyone has something to show us and it is <br/>\nimportant to listen and believe eachother.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also make scrap books, or provide the materials for the kids to make their <br/>\nown. Mainly for momentoes in the future. We write letters too, as a family <br/>\ndocumenting our adventures.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you stop getting hassled and your family starts trusting you more,<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\">http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"A","from":"A &lt;mumsienc@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"5uMwU19hrR5SX_1nuj_bXph-srCJamHyeiUZWRNEXSHbV5cfFZwKqGLPEC9ig5G1fkfCFP1I6jTk1uqsTZBXGw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Relatives","postDate":"993266238","msgId":22703,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNCMzQwQTNFLkMzRDA3QzEyQGFsbHRlbC5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDloMGYzZStlN2g1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22697,"nextInTopic":37074,"prevInTime":22702,"nextInTime":22704,"topicId":22697,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh Molly how wonderful for your children to travel and really see life.

Right now my mother homeschools the kids.  She <br/>\nreally wanted to do this (have been homeschooling seven years) so I <br/>\nlet her.  I &quot;substitute&quot; teach LOL.  We just purchased a 35&#39; GMC <br/>\ntransit bus and are going to start converting it to a motorhome soon. <br/>\nWe (DH and I) have been discussing how on earth we are going to <br/>\ncontinue with schooling the way we are now.  We have come to the <br/>\nconclusion that there is no way we will be able to.  We have decided <br/>\nthat unschooling is going to be the best for our family at this time. <br/>\nWe plan on putting a &quot;library&quot; on the bus and I have already begun <br/>\nbuying up appropriate books for when they want to read, lots of games,<br/>\nand of course our computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI DREAD telling my mother.  She already thinks I don&#39;t care about the <br/>\nschooling of my kids because I generally step aside and let her do it.<br/>\nI know, some out there will be wondering why I just don&#39;t &quot;take over&quot;.<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t think I do a complete enough job.  She never comes right <br/>\nout and says so but I&#39;ll hear muttered comments about how &quot;behind&quot; my <br/>\nkids are.  And I always feel that since she is the main &quot;teacher&quot; it <br/>\nisn&#39;t on my shoulders that they&#39;re &quot;behind&quot;.  It will be an <br/>\ninteresting conversation to say the least!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally understand the relative interogation.  In fact, we have <br/>\nquite a few that &quot;suggest&quot; we put them in public school for high <br/>\nschool, and a lot of other well meant advice.  I just nod and say &quot;Oh <br/>\nya.  Uh-huh.  Hmmm.&quot;  I say just ignore them.  I do!<br/>\n<br/>\nMolly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10070,"nextTopicId":37088}}
