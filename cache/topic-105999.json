I have also learned so much. I homeschooled my 11 yo son <br/>\nfor the last 3 years using all kinds of curriculum. I am so glad I <br/>\ndecided to get rid of it all and unschool. I was reading the posts <br/>\nabout shyness and it makes me think of Asperger&#39;s syndrome. I believe <br/>\nI have that after reading a few books about it. I still hate getting <br/>\nany kind of attention as much as I did when I was a kid. I just seem <br/>\nto have all the characteristics of this. One of the posts said that <br/>\nher kids hated the vacuum sound. AS kids are very sensitive to sounds, <br/>\ntextures, all kinds of stimulus. I guess I kind of diagnosed myself, <br/>\nbut it makes sense to me after all these years of preferring to be <br/>\nalone reading or hating attention.  Please don&#39;t think I am thinking <br/>\nany of your children have this. I would never assume that!  Thanks for <br/>\nall the info I get from these posts. You guys are great!
