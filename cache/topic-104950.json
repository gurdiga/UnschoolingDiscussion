Not at all.  <br/>\nAt least, not at all if by &quot;basics&quot; you mean the ability to perform  <br/>\nmental arithmetic or do long division. The message in the DOE report is  <br/>\nthat, for most people, when it comes to high school math, it&#39;s not what  <br/>\nyou learn that counts, it&#39;s the mental skills you develop.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the automobile became widely available, skill at riding a horse  <br/>\nwas replaced by skill at driving a car. Likewise, in the age of the  <br/>\npocket calculator and the electronic computer, computational skill is  <br/>\nno longer necessary. We need other abilities. Training students to be a  <br/>\npoor imitation of a $30 calculator is a waste of time for both teacher  <br/>\nand students.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever I say this kind of thing, I am invariably bombarded with  <br/>\naccusations that I am advocating a lowering of standards. Not at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing -- I mean using properly -- calculators and computers does not  <br/>\nrepresent a reduction in skill or the need for accuracy. On the  <br/>\ncontrary, successful use of today&#39;s computational aids requires far  <br/>\ngreater mathematical skill, and much more mathematical insight, than we  <br/>\nold timers had to master to get our sums right.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who claim that use of computational aids and an increased  <br/>\nemphasis on conceptual understanding lead to lower standards are way  <br/>\noff target. In my experience, the only thing that leads to lower  <br/>\nstandards is a lowering of standards. And you can lower standards just  <br/>\nas easily with an abacus as with the latest Pentium computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday we live in a society that is largely shaped by mathematics --  <br/>\nthough by one of life&#39;s paradoxes, the more important mathematics has  <br/>\nbecome in our lives, the more it has disappeared into the background.  <br/>\nYou would not know it unless you looked closely, but large parts of  <br/>\nmodern communications, transport, medicine, entertainment, sport,  <br/>\nfinancial trading, and even law enforcement, all make heavy use of,  <br/>\noften sophisticated mathematics. In the industrial age, we burned  <br/>\nfossil fuels to drive the engines of society. In the information age,  <br/>\nthe fuel we burn is mathematics. The mathematics involved is so  <br/>\nspecialized that we cannot hope to teach it in our schools. What we can  <br/>\n-- and should -- do is make sure our children are prepared to acquire,  <br/>\nquickly and efficiently, what particular math skills they require when  <br/>\nthe time comes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bulk of that basic skill set on which each individual can build in  <br/>\nlater life has little to do with numbers or arithmetic. The industrial  <br/>\nage was an age of number and arithmetic. The information age is quite  <br/>\ndifferent. The mathematics used today is the mathematics of abstract  <br/>\npatterns, relationships, and structures. As we continue to revise our  <br/>\ncurriculum for the high school math class of the next millennium, we  <br/>\nhave to accept the fact that the mathematics we teach today&#39;s students  <br/>\nwill not be (at least, should not be) the same as their parents  <br/>\nlearned. But that does not make it easier or less rigorous. Quite the  <br/>\nopposite.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of arithmetic, getting the right answer to a long division  <br/>\nproblem using pencil and paper is no more important to today&#39;s new  <br/>\ncitizen than being able to use a horse-drawn plow. On the other hand,  <br/>\ngetting the right answer to a problem using a powerful calculator or a  <br/>\ncomputer can be crucially important. It&#39;s also much harder. It&#39;s not  <br/>\nthe same problem the student is solving, of course. That&#39;s why the math  <br/>\ncurriculum has to change. The need for accurate, rigorous, precise  <br/>\nlogical thinking is more important to more people today than at any  <br/>\ntime in history. To try to achieve that ability by harking back to the  <br/>\nmathematics taught a half century ago, as continues to happen in states  <br/>\nacross the nation, will surely fail with today&#39;s students. They -- and  <br/>\nwe -- deserve better.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Keith Devlin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n--------<br/>\nDevlin&#39;s Angle is updated at the beginning of each month.<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n--------<br/>\nKeith Devlin ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:devlin@...\">devlin@...</a>) is Dean of Science at Saint  <br/>\nMary&#39;s College of California, in Moraga, California, and a Senior  <br/>\nResearcher at Stanford University.
