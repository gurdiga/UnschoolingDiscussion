As Quakers, as a religious matter we<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t celebrate any holidays (or, more accurately, all days are holidays<br/>\n&gt; as they hold equal promise for revealing the divine to us); as a<br/>\n&gt; cultural matter, we are free to do as we choose.  We are very conscious,<br/>\n&gt; however, of how important Christmas is to the people around us, and we<br/>\n&gt; try hard to honor that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the problem I have with Christmas, that so many other people set such<br/>\nstore by it.  I&#39;m not dominant enough in our family to put my foot down and<br/>\nsay, look, we&#39;re just not doing that this year, because I know I&#39;d offend a<br/>\nlot of my and my dh&#39;s family.  Your philosophy sounds great, to celebrate<br/>\nwhatever comes your way!  I sometimes don&#39;t feel like celebrating ANYTHING,<br/>\nexcept surviving the day!<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, does anyone have any insight on this?  I don&#39;t want, for so many<br/>\nreasons, my children to go to school.  But I don&#39;t know if I get on well<br/>\nenough with my eldest to do her justice by keeping her with me.  Of course,<br/>\nI&#39;d be mortified with guilt of I did send her to school and something<br/>\nhappend, and I don&#39;t want to &#39;give up&#39; on her by giving up my beliefs on<br/>\nschool and education and life.  I can&#39;t seem, atm, to stop picking her up<br/>\nfor little stuff, not &#39;schooly&#39; stuff, behaviour, and some&#39;s real petty,<br/>\ntoo.  Perhaps I&#39;m just PMS-ing, and I&#39;ll get better, but it seems unfair.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime to stop Rambling!<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3502,"nextTopicId":3510}}
