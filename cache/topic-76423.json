So it is <br/>\nno surprise that a homeschooling resolution came to the floor again <br/>\nthis year.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is stunning, however, to learn that the delegates spent much time <br/>\ndiscussing the Home-Schooling Resolution, debating whether to retain <br/>\nor remove a single word - &quot;unfunded.&quot;  Leaving the word in the <br/>\nResolution would have been a radical departure from their usual <br/>\nunilateral position against homeschooling.  The long debate suggests <br/>\nsharp disagreement in the ranks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is an excerpt from a report from<br/>\nThe Education Intelligence Agency, NEA Convention Coverage -- July 05<br/>\nReports are archived at  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eiaonline.com\">http://www.eiaonline.com</a><br/>\nHeadline:  One Word in Home-Schooling Resolution Causes Long Debate<br/>\n&quot;...The most contentious amendment involved the deletion of a single <br/>\nword in Resolution B-69, which deals with home-schooling. The <br/>\nresolution had a sentence that read: &quot;The Association also believes <br/>\nthat unfunded home-schooled students should not participate in any <br/>\nextracurricular activities in the public schools.&quot; Some states <br/>\nprovide funding for home-schoolers to participate in after-school <br/>\nactivities. The amendment was to remove the word &quot;unfunded&quot; so that <br/>\nNEA&#39;s opposition would be categorical... the will of the majority of <br/>\ndelegates was to delete &quot;unfunded,&quot; reasoning that with or without <br/>\nthe money to do so, they didn&#39;t want home-schoolers in any way to <br/>\nedge out those students who were &quot;with us all day.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Education Intelligence Agency conducts public education research, <br/>\nanalysis and investigations.
