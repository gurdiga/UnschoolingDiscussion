I&#39;m way backlogged on e-mail. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still a very green, trying-to-find-my-way, let go kind of unschooler. (I <br/>\nprobably couldn&#39;t even call myself that yet...but I hope to be there)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m going to say in advance that I have a lot of questions and doubts <br/>\nof my own related to unschooling.

So, I want to make a <br/>\ndisclaimer in the beginning and state that I am not trying to intentionally <br/>\ncome on this list and challenge any of you.  I am truly trying to learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo here goes...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is about the issue of children being forced to do certain activities, <br/>\netc.  <br/>\nI happen to have a couple of children who are very cautious and very <br/>\nunwilling to try new things.  And yet, when they have been gently pushed into <br/>\nsome of these things, they find out that they love them.  My eldest daughter, <br/>\nfor example, has a lovely voice and loves to sing.  There was a show choir <br/>\nshe could be in and my hubby and I really kind of pushed her to do it because <br/>\nwe felt she needed the social stimulation.  It was a difficult first six <br/>\nmonths and she had her ups and downs.  We let her skip rehearsals and <br/>\nperformances and didn&#39;t push her to sign up again for another year.  She did <br/>\nall by herself, though, and now in her second year, this is the top priority <br/>\nin her life and something she totally &quot;lives for&quot; each week.  Besides that, <br/>\nshe has made several good friends in the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wonder-if we wouldn&#39;t have &quot;pushed&quot; her, would she have even known <br/>\nthat this opportunity existed?  Or probably she would have come around to it <br/>\non her own, right?  This is where the trust comes in, isn&#39;t it?  I&#39;ve got to <br/>\ntrust that she can find what she needs when she needs it.  But I can <br/>\ncertainly offer resources.  That&#39;s how I envision my role, as a mentor or a <br/>\nresource person if she asks.  Is that the idea?  I know I&#39;m asking lots of <br/>\nquestions, but I&#39;m just craving some enlightenment!

But it is not IMPOSED - it <br/>\nis by choice. When the kids take piano lessons - which they&#39;ve all done at <br/>\ndifferent times - it is because they REALLY want to do it. If they don&#39;t want <br/>\nto continue, then they don&#39;t continue. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference is that the child is doing the choosing - and is choosing to <br/>\nlearn something from that expert and can choose to stop it if they don&#39;t <br/>\nthink it is working for them or if they just lose interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, before you ask, yes sometimes they just don&#39;t feel like going THAT day <br/>\nand yes I nudge a bit and encourage them to recognize that it is a momentary <br/>\nwhim and to see that they&#39;d be sorry to drop the whole activity because they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t feel like going to one lesson. And no I don&#39;t make them practice EVER <br/>\nand yes I&#39;m willing to pay for lessons because it is LESSONS that they want <br/>\n(assuming we can afford them). And yes there are weeks and months that they <br/>\ndon&#39;t practice, but just show up at the lesson each week unprepared. I make <br/>\nsure we have teachers who are okay with that and tell them I&#39;m willing to pay <br/>\nfor that half-hour a week of them working with my kid even if the progress is <br/>\nsuper slow at times because the kids don&#39;t practice. And yes the kids do <br/>\npractice in spurts. My 14 yo is now asking to go back to piano and violin <br/>\nlessons and she&#39;s spending a lot of time playing piano and violin on her own <br/>\nright now. She&#39;ll definitely practice on her own too because she&#39;s highly <br/>\nmotivated right now. If she loses interest and wants to spend her time doing <br/>\nsomething else, later, then that&#39;s what she&#39;ll do.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":69718075,"authorName":"Joan Wilson","from":"&quot;Joan Wilson&quot; &lt;jroselady@...&gt;","profile":"jroselady","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Rank Newbie Pipes Up","postDate":"1018288807","msgId":34233,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEhORU1JTlBBQ0FJTkRMQkdKTUNBT0VCR0NEQUEuanJvc2VsYWR5QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PEYxODhqb1lBUE5YUlBtY2FyY1IwMDAwNzRlMEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":33957,"nextInTopic":34237,"prevInTime":34232,"nextInTime":34234,"topicId":33913,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think the question is how does your child feel about them.   :) My question is this: How do unschoolers feel about lessons?

I shopped around for one that was more into philosophy than <br/>\n&quot;fighting,&quot; and we&#39;re really  happy with it.  Kirby teaches one of the <br/>\nbeginning classes each week, and participates with the adults in seminars and <br/>\nspecial events.  They would let him be in the adult class, but he prefers the <br/>\nadvanced kids&#39; class, because he has friends there he&#39;s known for years and <br/>\nthat&#39;s the only time he sees them.

She&#39;s really excited about it though.  When we <br/>\nsigned her up we told them our priority as parents was that she have fun and <br/>\nnot be overly pressured.  We said she was doing it because SHE wanted to,  <br/>\nand if she didn&#39;t like it we wouldn&#39;t press her to continue.  They didn&#39;t act <br/>\nlike they had heard that before.  It doesn&#39;t matter; that&#39;s our deal with <br/>\nHolly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty played ice hockey one year but didn&#39;t like the locker room culture and <br/>\ntraditions.  He had taken six skating levels before that (a deal he made with <br/>\nme--that he could play hockey if he took their six classes first so he would <br/>\nbe a really competent skater and less likely to get huled with the &quot;OH aren&#39;t <br/>\nyou CUTE!&quot; from the older girls and women (he was eight).<br/>\n<br/>\nOh!  Holly was learning fiddle from a homeschooling dad (violinist from age 8 <br/>\nwho three years ago started doing Celtic and bluegrass) who was himself <br/>\nexperimenting with teaching in a more student-focussed and less &quot;curriculum&quot; <br/>\nfocussed way, so it was an experiment for both of them.  She&#39;s taking a break <br/>\nfrom the lessons, but still practices sometimes and fully intends to go back, <br/>\nmaybe in summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the child is the focus and not the &quot;subject matter,&quot; if it comes from <br/>\ntheir interest and curiosity and not the parents&#39; pressure or requirement, <br/>\nthe traditional pressures aren&#39;t so much in effect.   If it&#39;s something they <br/>\ncan&#39;t do at home (ice skating, acting in a play in a real theatre), their <br/>\nvoluntary participation doesn&#39;t, in my opinion, change the unschooling aspect <br/>\nof their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I convinced them (subtly or overtly) that they weren&#39;t likely to learn <br/>\nscience or history at our house, but they needed to want to take classes <br/>\nelsewhere, I&#39;d think neither I nor they were very clear on the potential of <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59432230,"authorName":"joanna514","from":"&quot;joanna514&quot; &lt;Wilkinson6@...&gt;","profile":"joanna514","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Rank Newbie Pipes Up","postDate":"1017499963","msgId":33921,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE4NGpmciszaDNxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEYxODhqb1lBUE5YUlBtY2FyY1IwMDAwNzRlMEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":33914,"nextInTopic":33924,"prevInTime":33920,"nextInTime":33922,"topicId":33913,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... lessons, ... child ... a ...
