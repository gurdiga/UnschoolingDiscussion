We had about 4 good channels and 4 fuzzy channels, and we had <br/>\nbeen used to having more than that.   So we were feeling fairly deprived <br/>\nof TV before we started.  I have one kid and two TVs.  Both of us <br/>\nwatched TV heavily for a couple of months.  He continued to seem <br/>\nstrongly interested in staying home and watching TV for about six <br/>\nmonths.  (And I was pretty scared that he would be &quot;hooked&quot; forever.)  <br/>\nThen the number of cartoons watched every day seemed to go down and I <br/>\nnoticed him being fairly selective about his choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause there are no siblings, the dynamics for agreeing what to watch <br/>\nare different.  (Since my husband is only home two days a week, I mostly <br/>\ndefer to him and figure it&#39;s his &quot;turn&quot; when he&#39;s here.)  It may take <br/>\n*longer* for your kids to absorb &quot;as much TV as they want&quot;, since they <br/>\ndo have to compete with each other over what show to watch.  But they <br/>\ncould get sick of TV sooner, if they are sitting there watching stuff <br/>\nthey don&#39;t like because someone else selected it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do have a TiVo-like recorder that makes it very convenient to record <br/>\nanything and watch it later.  I really like having this.  You can <br/>\napparently buy these at electronic stores, not just get them from the <br/>\ncable company.

me.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:

id=\"ygrps-yiv-305165566\">here&#39;s a question for y&#39;all..<br/>\n<br/>\nwho out there unschools and doesn&#39;t have a tv at all in their house?<br/>\n<br/>\nsince the birth of our first child, we&#39;ve had a tv.  we watched <br/>\nmoderately when she was young, but as time passed and finances <br/>\nchanged, we watched less and cut the cable (therefore, having much <br/>\nless to watch.)  none of my kids have ever watched tv much, mostly <br/>\nbecause there wasn&#39;t much, beyond saturday morning cartoons, that <br/>\nappealed to them.  they watched game shows, martha stewart (liked her <br/>\ncrafty stuff and recipes), and reality tv stuff.  not every day and <br/>\nnot very much.  they also liked computer games,dvd&#39;s, and other stuff <br/>\non the computer, but spent most of the day playing freely, reading <br/>\nstories with me, and joining in on my daily activities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nthis summer, we lived for 3 months out in the woods with no <br/>\nelectricty, hence no tv.  they never got bored or whined for tv.  in <br/>\naugust, we moved back to town and were so sad to find that we got <br/>\nabsolutely no channels with our antenna (as opposed to the 3-4 we got <br/>\nin before) and we didn&#39;t want to miss out on the olympics.  we ended <br/>\nup finding a super cheap trial offer with a cable company, so we <br/>\ndecided we&#39;d go with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe kids were delighted to find all the programming directed at them <br/>\nand spent a ton of time watching, which was unusual for them.  it was <br/>\nconvenient for them to be occupied at first since we were so consumed <br/>\nwith the process of unpacking, but as days passed and we were more <br/>\nsettled, i started to worry and restrict them a bit.  i discovered <br/>\nthis list and started to critically examine why i was having such a <br/>\nhard time accepting their new found hobby.  i figured they were <br/>\nundoing all the damage i&#39;d done in restricting them and it was a <br/>\nnovelty that would fade with time and become a more balanced activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nfast forward a bit to current life (7-8 weeks later.)  the kids wake <br/>\nup and watch tv immediately...there has been no exception to this, <br/>\nnot one day!  they continue to watch all day long and into the night, <br/>\nfalling asleep watching.  i try during the day to watch with them and <br/>\noffer different activities that they&#39;ve adored in the past when they <br/>\nseem restless, but not to much avail.  they don&#39;t want to go outside, <br/>\nhave a hard time recognizing hunger cues, argue and fight over <br/>\ncontrol of the station and/or remote, blow up if i suggest watching a <br/>\nmore adult show (even when i give them advance notice), etc.  my <br/>\noldest (6 1/2) expresses that she&#39;s sad she doesn&#39;t have anyone to <br/>\nplay with, but when i offer ideas (even the homeschool group <br/>\ngatherings she&#39;s always enjoyed), she can&#39;t disconnect herself to go <br/>\nwithout me turning the tv off.  she&#39;s also picked up a lot of mean <br/>\nstuff from shows...calling names like *dummy* and making fun of her <br/>\nbrother when he makes a mistake.  she likes shows like rugrats where <br/>\nthere&#39;s a character that acts like that and finds it funny.  we talk <br/>\nabout why it&#39;s not nice, but it still comes out.  she&#39;s become even <br/>\nmore impulsive that way.  my middle child (4) is the one that <br/>\nconcerns me the most, though.  he won&#39;t leave the television to even <br/>\ngo to the bathroom.  he&#39;s afraid he&#39;ll miss something and i can&#39;t <br/>\n*pause* the show.  i try to get him to go during commercials, but he <br/>\nthinks they&#39;re fun too.  and he doesn&#39;t seem to communicate about <br/>\nanything but what he saw on tv.  his attention span is so short that <br/>\nhe rudely interrupts me in the middle of a sentence saying, *so what?<br/>\n* my youngest (2) seems oblivious to the hubbub.  she and i read <br/>\nstories together, play with dollies and train sets, play hide and go <br/>\nseek, wash dishes together, etc.  just like we all used to do.  it&#39;s <br/>\nhard for me not to mourn this...i feel like i&#39;ve lost my kids in tv <br/>\nworld! <br/>\n<br/>\ni understand now that watching tv isn&#39;t terribly detrimental to all <br/>\nkids, but i wonder how their behavior can be explained.  i&#39;ve had it <br/>\nhappen twice now that i&#39;ve gotten fed up and unplugged the tv.  to my <br/>\nshock and surprise, the kids were instantly remarkably pleasant and <br/>\ncreative in what we should do.  we played for hours, baked stuff, <br/>\nplayed games outside, they joyously helped out with chores like <br/>\nhanging the wash, etc.  once i turned the tv off to go on an outing, <br/>\nthey were fine, but when i left them to their own devices and made <br/>\nthem aware of when we needed to go and offered help in getting ready, <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t move.  i got, *ok, mom.  in a minute.  oh, well...i wanna <br/>\nwatch one more show.*  when that show&#39;s done, they want just one <br/>\nmore, etc.  i&#39;m at a loss here.  i&#39;m trying to convince dh that this <br/>\nchange is so important for our family, but what&#39;s actually happening <br/>\nis making me want to pull my hair out!  <br/>\n<br/>\nthe same sort of thing is happening with letting go of the whole <br/>\nconcept of good food before bad food idea.  we&#39;re buying more junk <br/>\nfood than we ever have before, scarfing it, regretting we did, and <br/>\nthen wishing we had more money to buy more junk.  we&#39;ve always kind <br/>\nof had it where we didn&#39;t buy sweets much, and if we had them, they <br/>\nwere to be kind of rationed out.  with the restraint gone, it&#39;s <br/>\nalmost like competetion...who can get to it the fastest kind of <br/>\nthing.  i&#39;ve gained a bit of weight and am eating more of everything <br/>\nwith the stress of everything going on.  this certainly doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhelp.  the kids are happy about being able to have what they want, <br/>\nbut are neglecting to make the accompanying good choices like they <br/>\nused to.  i&#39;m very loose on what could be considered good food and am <br/>\nlooking over larger spans of time, but it&#39;s really not very good.  we <br/>\ncan&#39;t afford to present a ton of different options foodwise on our <br/>\nvery small budget, so i&#39;m starting to wonder what&#39;s going to happen <br/>\nhere.  my middle child is again the one i&#39;m most worrying <br/>\nabout...he&#39;s got food sensitivities to dairy and is now so covered in <br/>\neczema that he&#39;s uncomfortble and itching all the time.  when i talk <br/>\nto him about why he&#39;s itchy, he understands, but when he has a chance <br/>\nto eat it again, he disregards his reaction with statements like *i <br/>\nlike to be itchy.*  what the heck?<br/>\n<br/>\n*sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\nso i&#39;m extrememly frustrated and wishing we could have had the sense <br/>\nto start this at birth.  though that&#39;s not going to help us now.  can <br/>\nanyone who&#39;s started out later in life relate to our experience.  am <br/>\ni just being impatient?  i don&#39;t feel like i&#39;ve got unrealistic <br/>\nexpectations...i knew the kids would eat a lot of junk food and watch <br/>\na lot of tv for a while.  but i didn&#39;t think that would be pretty <br/>\nmuch all they do.  all prejudice aside, this is certainly not <br/>\nhealthy.  is it a natural response to letting go of restrictions?  or <br/>\nam i just going about all of this completely wrong?  or have i just <br/>\nnot waited long enough?<br/>\n<br/>\nin need of reassurance despite this not being a support group :)<br/>\nlisa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9385,"nextTopicId":100537}}
