I <br/>\nfound that if I drop into the local supermarket shortly before the huge window <br/>\nposters are going to be changed and ask for them, the manager is usually happy <br/>\nto let us have them if I&#39;ll pick them up within a few hours so they&#39;re not <br/>\ntaking up storage space. The backs offer acres of clean white surface for BIG <br/>\nart. I&#39;ve also gotten large poster board size card posters from restaurants.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92056,"nextTopicId":92094}}
