They all came at me <br/>\nwith all the terrible things that were done to each of them, <br/>\nscreaming and crying and hitting and kicking and I said &quot;WAIT!&quot;  <br/>\nRaise your hand if I called one of you a name tonight.  No one raised <br/>\ntheir hand except my 3 year old who heard &quot;Raise your hand&quot; and <br/>\nnothing else! lol They giggled a little when he did that.  Then I <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Raise your hand if I hit, kicked, or pinched one of you <br/>\ntonight&quot;.  Again the three year old raises his hands and the other <br/>\ntwo start laughing harder.  Then I say, &quot;And raise your hand if I <br/>\nthrew a train at you tonight&quot;.  Again, the three year old raises his <br/>\nhand.  Now they&#39;re really laughing hard.  And I said (in an <br/>\nexaggerated dramatic voice) &quot;If I didn&#39;t hit, kick, pinch, call you a <br/>\nname, or throw a train at you, why are you in here yelling at me <br/>\nabout being hit, kicked, pinched, called names, and having trains <br/>\nthrown at you?&quot;  And they all started laughing hard (tension <br/>\nrelieved).  But I swear within 2 minutes they were at it again.
