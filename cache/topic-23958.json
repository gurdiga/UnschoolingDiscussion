The <br/>\nlesson he took from the war that stuck with him for the rest of his <br/>\nlife, according to Menand, was that &quot;certitude leads to violence.&quot; <br/>\nAbout this Menand writes, &quot;This is a proposition that has an easy <br/>\napplication ÂŠto ideologues, dogmatists, and bullies-people who think <br/>\nthat their rightness justifies them in imposing on anyone who does <br/>\nnot happen to subscribe to their particular ideology, dogma, or <br/>\nnotion of turf. If the conviction of rightness is powerful enough, <br/>\nresistance to it will be met, sooner or later by force.

I don&#39;t think anyone should feel <br/>\nlike they need to apologize for sharing thoughts and ideas; quite the <br/>\ncontrary, I think one of the problems with this mode of communication <br/>\nis that everyone starts thinking they need to write in short bursts, <br/>\nkeep it simple, don&#39;t clutter peoples&#39; mailboxes. The short <br/>\nconversational style of most lists is fine, but I find the lists <br/>\nwhere people post without concern about length are the most <br/>\ninteresting and thought-provoking. And I enjoy getting my thoughts <br/>\nprovoked. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, from my experience, when one person does start hogging a <br/>\nlist the listmembers will usually let him or her know it&#39;s not <br/>\nappreciated.

I wish I could have thought of those things!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think usually I am taken by surprize, like it slowly dawns on me that I am not being &quot;heard&quot;--like in the conversation in question-she started it like a &quot;discussion&quot; about guns or whatever.   I tried to explain over and over my perspective to this person who I really like and respect. And it wasnt until I got home -and really the next morning, that I felt so awful.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm,yeah..and I think I was surprized by how effected I was. I dont know, I have spent so much of my time understanding what I am doing around here- that saying my kid has &quot;deep seated underlying anger&quot;, was a little much for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSHe is was/is at a terrible time in her life- but knowing that was hardly a help when I was first processing the whole thing.  Part of me is hoping that her little son is like (?) the kid on this list whose mom kept her first two children smugly away from guns, who was practically born with them in his hand! Makes you rethink everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to your point- realizing that an argument serves no purpose- good.  I think maybe if I get in this situation again, I will just ask something like, &quot;wait-do you think our conversation is serving a purpose?&quot; and &quot;what is it?&quot;  I think it would help clarify things!  And I would be also remembering that I couldn&#39;t *really* think anything until I went home to ask my husband...(hee hee!)
