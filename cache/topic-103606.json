Maybe unschoolers who limit TV would  make <br/>\nthat self-supporting argument.<br/>\n <br/>\nI was looking for one of my own webpages (some get lost because I don&#39;t  <br/>\nremember where I&#39;ve linked them or what the names are) and came upon something  <br/>\nI&#39;d never seen or heard of and it had a link to my site.  There were people  <br/>\ndiscussing unschooling, with only a couple of unschoolers coming in to clarify a  <br/>\nbit.  I saved it on another computer and will bring bits of it over  here.  <br/>\nInterestingly, all the weird stereotypes seemed represented.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-&gt; Anything can become addicting. <br/>\n-=-If this were true, it would  be a miracle that we are all still alive!-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nAll those 19th century opium fiends are dead. <br/>\n&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nMy mom was an alcoholic all her adult life, with a nine year AA  reprieve.  <br/>\nShe smoked cigarettes with NO break, from her late teens.   She lived into her <br/>\n70&#39;s.  But her nicotine and alcohol addictions were  real, and ugly and <br/>\nexpensive, and both were listed on her death  certificate.  Still...  <br/>\n <br/>\nIf habit and addiction can denote (name, or refer to) the same thing, they  <br/>\nhave very different connotations (side information).<br/>\n <br/>\nThere&#39;s that father&#39;s day saying about lots of men are fathers, but only  the <br/>\nspecial ones are daddies (or some such).   There are other  denotations for <br/>\nmale parents.  &quot;Sperm donor&quot; isn&#39;t a very nice one.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103578,"nextTopicId":103610}}
