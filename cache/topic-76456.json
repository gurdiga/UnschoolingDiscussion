In it, I related a couple of<br/>\nstories of the totally useless bits I still remember (a poem by a guy<br/>\nI never heard of, and of which I don&#39;t know the meaning, but which I<br/>\ncan recite perfectly, and with feeling!) I&#39;ll be happy to send a copy<br/>\nto anyone who e-mails me privately. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shantinik@...\">shantinik@...</a>)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it seems to have hit a nerve, and I&#39;ve got some totally<br/>\nhilarious e-mails back -- my favorite was another student of Russian,<br/>\nwhose only remaining bit is knowing how to sing &quot;It&#39;s a Long Road to<br/>\nTipperary&quot; (in Russian.) <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I thought a collection of these would make for a great future<br/>\narticle (and might be fun to share here as well, if you choose). (Now<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to offend anyone -- if language teaching somehow worked<br/>\nfor you, more power to it!) But I&#39;d love to get a little collection --<br/>\nwhat linguistic flotsam-and-jetsam do you have hiding in your<br/>\nsynapses, and which flossing doesn&#39;t reach?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you post it here, I&#39;ll assume I can use it (without attribution of<br/>\ncourse), unless you say otherwise?
