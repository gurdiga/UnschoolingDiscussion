From","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1954492954\">I agree with Bridget, some kids do not seem able to self regulate TV when <br/>\nthey are allowed unlimited access to it. I have gone around on this issue a <br/>\nton. From TV free (which I find the best way to limit), to unlimited TV, to <br/>\nallowing a certain amount. My kids are little, still formulating their <br/>\nbeings. I find TV is so easy for them, they choose it over say making a <br/>\npuzzle or playing cooperatively together. Anyhow, it helps me and my son <br/>\nwhen we know what he wants to watch and when. When he asks can I, I say yes, <br/>\nwhen we are finished with dinner, or yes when I am nursing your sister to <br/>\nsleep. He also seems content when he understands, you can watch 1 movie <br/>\ntoday. I have him decide what he wants to watch and then we put in into the <br/>\nfamily schedule. The same idea works well for us with the computer and <br/>\ngames. Usually, the kids plan to play a computer game when dad is home. He <br/>\nis a much better technical support person than I am. My daughters seem to <br/>\nnot get attached to the boxes like my little guy. He will watch it all day. <br/>\nHe has forgotten to eat, or pee and then freaks out when it needs to go off. <br/>\nI am also easily annoyed by the sound of the TV and I like to listen to <br/>\nmusic. In our tiny house it is 1 or the other, not both. We do limit TV now. <br/>\nAs the children mature, I will reconsider this issue. Am I too controlling? <br/>\nmaybe. Yet, I feel TV interferes with other experiences and I want the <br/>\nfamily to have lots of connected time together.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34420,"nextTopicId":34545}}
