(I am not sure exactly what ISP stands for!!  8-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I believe the poster gave a link or phone number????  (In California)<br/>\n<br/>\n I have been giving this a lot of thought and weighing the<br/>\npros and cons of stepping out of the Charter school now or waiting until the end of<br/>\nthe<br/>\nyear.  Staying with the Charter means monthly samples of his work, grade cards and<br/>\nILPs , which I have not minded, but producing all of those will be a little more<br/>\ndifficult<br/>\nif we begin UNschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I had mentioned previously, the Charter school pays for Kristopher&#39;s tutoring,<br/>\nwhich he<br/>\nloves.  Also, they paid for tennis lessons last fall, and there are supposed to be<br/>\nmore lessons<br/>\nthis spring.  Also, they will pay for PE classes as well as music and art classes.<br/>\nThese are<br/>\nall things we cannot afford to pay for him to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I apologize, I don&#39;t remember your name......could you post again?  or write<br/>\nto<br/>\nme off list?  Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarol<br/>\n  Grandma to Kristopher</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89230,"nextTopicId":88734}}
