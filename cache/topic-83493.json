I am happy with myself and my behavior with the kids now.  The thing I did this morning waiting for everyone to get ready to go with me just because they wanted to, not because they had to was just say I&#39;m getting frustrated.  And I went to the van and everyone that was sitting there staring at the tv came to the van and we went to the store.  Spent a nice couple of hours just browsing and replacing pillows the dog loves to tear up LOL.  The point is, I thought of shutting off the tv to get everyones attention.  That is old.  I did raise my voice just a little because I was frustrated, but that was it.  And that will teach them to use good words instead of screaming mean things and hitting themselves.

Those<br/>\nwho advocate the use of spanking as a part of discipline usually couch these<br/>\nbeliefs by saying it must be done without anger or rage, in a &quot;disciplined&quot;<br/>\nway. I.e. &quot;if you continue to refuse to ____________ you will receive a<br/>\nspanking at bed time.&quot;  And a small , unscientific survey at church last<br/>\nnight revealed that those raised by parents who were (in this case) Quakers<br/>\n, remembered being spanked once or twice their entire childhood if at all.<br/>\nNot regularly, need it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in a funny position because I do not believe spanking is good or<br/>\nnecessary and I certainly would never hit my child in anger but I have<br/>\nspanked from time to time (maybe 6 times in 10 years of parenting 3<br/>\nchildren) when there was a situation I could not figure out anything else to<br/>\ndo.  Over the years I&#39;ve learned that in every case, with my children, they<br/>\nwere *not* accepting of this behavior.  Neither the child being spanked nor<br/>\nthe siblings would accept this sort of punishment.  They got together and<br/>\ngave me a talking to!  (good for them!)  If I had it to do again I would not<br/>\nspank. Ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for convincing people not to spank, that&#39;s a hard sell.  Most people are<br/>\nnot going to change their views about this lightly.  And unfortunately, the<br/>\nworst offenders will merely change to another abusive practice because it&#39;s<br/>\nnot about disciplining the child.  Abuse is usually about dysfunctional<br/>\nfeelings of the parent.  Mom or dad is in denial or needs to feel powerful<br/>\nor is not capable of showing love and affection blah blah blah because of<br/>\nhis or her own deficient upbringing.  Peacefulness and love are things that<br/>\nmust be discovered and grown in the adult before one can expect to see it in<br/>\nparenting behavior.  It takes lots of honest to goodness work to change<br/>\nhabits that are grown into a person.  And of course the person must want to<br/>\nchange.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the idea I&#39;ve seen on this list that shepherds didn&#39;t beat their<br/>\nsheep with a staff, well, there&#39;s also the rod.  I&#39;m afraid a deeper look is<br/>\nnecessary if you are going to try to argue the Bible doesn&#39;t advocate<br/>\nspanking.<br/>\nConsider: &quot;the rod and rebuke give wisdom.   But a child left to himself<br/>\nbrings shame to his mother.&quot; Prov. 29:15<br/>\n&quot;Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child:  The rod of correction<br/>\nwill drive it far from him&quot; Prov. 22:15<br/>\nand &quot;Do not withhold correction from a child.  For if you beat him with a<br/>\nrod he will not die.&quot; Prov. 23:13<br/>\n<br/>\nYou get the idea.  There are not too many of these but they are there, so if<br/>\nyou are hoping to sweep away the old testament style &quot;correction&quot; with a<br/>\nspeech on the proper use of the shepherds&#39;s staff, you&#39;ll have to try again.<br/>\nIMHO mentions of the &quot;rod&quot; seem to correlate with rebellion of a serious<br/>\nnature in an older child not two year olds taking a tantrum in a store.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a better tack would be to dig up all the verses about loving<br/>\nchildren and the consequences of bringing harm to them.<br/>\nHere are a few for those of you still interested enough to continue reading<br/>\nthis long-winded post.<br/>\n&quot;Whoever receives one little child like this in my name receives Me (Jesus<br/>\nspeaking).&quot;  Q. how mad would He be if we mistreat that little one? A.  &quot;But<br/>\nwhoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would<br/>\nbe better for him that a Millstone were hung around his neck, and he were<br/>\ndrowned in the depth of the sea.&quot;  Matt18:5-6<br/>\nDo you think beating and humiliating a child or mistreating him would cause<br/>\nhim to sin?  I believe so as it causes pain, disconnect and disfunction<br/>\nwhich tends to perpetuate more violence and mistreatment of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this one:  &quot;you fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath...&quot;<br/>\nEphesians 6:4a<br/>\nalso from Ephesians &quot; Be kind to one another , tenderhearted, forgiving one<br/>\nanother even as God in Christ forgave you.&quot;  Does this apply to families<br/>\nwith children? Of course it does!<br/>\nThis last verse and hundreds like it are the crux (no pun intended) of what<br/>\nthe Bible teaches Christians to do and be.  The Christian must honor the<br/>\nsacred trust Christ gives us by forgiving our sins and adopting us &quot;as dear<br/>\nchildren&quot;.  What would He say if, after receiving his tender love, we turn<br/>\naround and offer a stingy, nit-picky, conditional type of love to our own<br/>\nchildren.  We are to be &quot;imitators of God as dear children.&quot; Eph.5:1   I<br/>\ngotta be honest.  God doesn&#39;t take off His belt to whip me every time I make<br/>\na mistake or even when I rebelliously sin against Him.  Instead He waits, He<br/>\nloves, He gently prods me back into his arms by his unfailing love.  I want<br/>\nto be like that with my kids and I have plenty of role models of my<br/>\nacquaintance to model that after.<br/>\nLove and Peace to all,<br/>\nKrisula<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83584,"nextTopicId":83608}}
