It wasn&#39;t that he <br/>\nhad a problem learning a certain way.  He couldn&#39;t focus or <br/>\nconcentrate on anything as long as he would have liked to.  Making <br/>\nEVERYTHING he wanted to do frustrating for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike the NASA thing, he was pretty much in control.  We had a NASA <br/>\nastronaut that was showing him around, he got to touch, manipulate, <br/>\ntalk, ask, do basically whatever he wanted.  He was the one that was <br/>\ngreatly interested, so it was lead by him for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there were probably some places that were off limits but it <br/>\ndidn&#39;t seem like it, anything he asked about, he got to see and <br/>\nexperience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter we left the first day (several day experience) he said he felt <br/>\nlike he really wasn&#39;t able to &quot;get&quot; what he wanted to from the <br/>\nexperience.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like he would choose a book he really wanted to read.  He just <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t concentrate long enough to read it.  Book on tape?  Great <br/>\nfor some people, not for him, to him after only a few minutes it <br/>\nsounded like a forgein language.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for him there really wasn&#39;t another way around this.  We tried <br/>\nLOTS of things.  Books on tape being one, me reading to him another, <br/>\nboth his suggestions, both just didn&#39;t work for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHE wanted something to change, he made adjustments, we made <br/>\nadjustments, we tried every remedy we were suggested.  Finally after <br/>\nmore than a year, we tried the ritalin, I was scared.  I had heard <br/>\nmany horror stories, kids crushing it and sniffing it for one.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally I agreed to TRY the ritalin.  I had no expectations of it <br/>\nreally working.  The only kids I had personally known on the drug <br/>\nwere VERY hyper, very high strung and it seemed their mothers gave it <br/>\nto them like candy almost.  Oh, come here and get your <br/>\nritalin.  &quot;Little Jimmie, you can&#39;t sit still today, get me your <br/>\nritalin right NOW!&quot;.  Those types of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn was NOT like that in any sense.  A very quiet kid, a thoughtful <br/>\nalways seeming in deep thought kind of child.  What could this drug <br/>\npossibly do to help him?<br/>\n<br/>\nLOTS, for him anyway.  I&#39;m not saying that this is the path for <br/>\nanyone&#39;s child but for mine it was right.  I feel badly that I made <br/>\nhim wait so long for something that so obviously worked wonders for <br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe likes putting together model cars and airplanes, he NEVER finished <br/>\neven one until he started medication.  He NEVER had mastered a video <br/>\ngame until he started medication.  He had never sat through a movie <br/>\nat the theater before medication.  So many things that once sounded <br/>\nlike wa wa wa wa after a few minutes are now such an enjoyable part <br/>\nof his life.  Because of one tiny pill twice a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe did find a way around his problem, a way to learn, a way to be <br/>\nless frustrated, a way to cope and explore, for him his way was <br/>\nritalin.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still think it&#39;s over used, over prescribed and probably for many <br/>\nwrong reasons but I&#39;m just saying there are some children who it <br/>\nmakes a difference in living in a dull colorless world and a bright <br/>\nsunny vibrant one.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma2kids","from":"&quot;zenmomma2kids&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: ritalin (everyone&#39;s probably sick of this) (long...","postDate":"1050687996","msgId":65422,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI3cGRscyt1N3U1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNFQTAzNjI3Ljg1MTA4OTdBQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":65419,"nextInTopic":65424,"prevInTime":65421,"nextInTime":65423,"topicId":65318,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... just smile and nod politely without understanding.
