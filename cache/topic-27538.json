My 10yo dd has had this happen too.  My<br/>\n&gt; heart breaks because<br/>\n&gt; &gt;we make so much progress with her self esteem and then it<br/>\n&gt; is so easily<br/>\n&gt; &gt;knocked down.  Not to mention the immediate feelings of<br/>\n&gt; guilt I get for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;not working more on her times tables.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I guess we need to give them more preparation for these<br/>\n&gt; things.  What<br/>\n&gt; &gt;would you say to those kids if you were in her shoes?<br/>\n&gt; Give them a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;confident reply.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;All those conversations about different learning styles,<br/>\n&gt; what she knows<br/>\n&gt; &gt;over them...those are lost at times like that.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;It&#39;s a good learning experience for realizing the damage<br/>\n&gt; you can do to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;another person with your words.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I would go ahead and get her a math workbook.  You can get<br/>\n&gt; those spectrum<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ones that are by grade and tell her to work at her own<br/>\n&gt; pace.  She may love<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it, she may hate it.  It&#39;s cheaper than a curriculum and<br/>\n&gt; will give her<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what she is looking for.  I have one child that adores her<br/>\n&gt; workbooks and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my 10 hates them...but that is what she pulls out when she<br/>\n&gt; runs into<br/>\n&gt; &gt;something like that. (I buy them for the 10 too, because<br/>\n&gt; inevitably she<br/>\n&gt; &gt;feels jilted if she doesn&#39;t get one) <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;They also use those workbooks when they &quot;play school&quot; with<br/>\n&gt; their friends. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;They enjoy checking each others work.
