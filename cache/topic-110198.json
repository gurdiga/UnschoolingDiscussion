","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-183108932\">As I was typing the paragraphs off the letter to my sister (which I only <br/>\nsaved on paper), I was thinking back to other people I might have reproduced with. <br/>\n  Only one, of all the serious boyfriends back to the age of 14, was NOT the <br/>\nchild of an alcoholic parent.   One had both parents alcoholic (though the dad <br/>\nhad run a truck off the road or into a tree and died   before he was born).   <br/>\n Keith&#39;s parents aren&#39;t alcoholic.   My dad wasn&#39;t.   My kids are less at <br/>\nrisk than some.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Halloween all my kids went to a party--the same party.   Holly&#39;s nearly-15 <br/>\nyear old friend was here and she went too.   There was drinking, and I <br/>\nlearned in bits and pieces without really asking anyone to tell me everything, that <br/>\nMarty and another mid-teen, Julie, were the only two not to drink at all.   <br/>\nThat left Holly and Jasmine in the &quot;drank some&quot; category.    Jasmine was staying <br/>\nat our house for several days, and when her mom called I let her know.   I <br/>\nknew the mom wouldn&#39;t be upset, but I did tell her I was going to bring it up <br/>\nand talk to them a bit about it, and she said fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when we were out in the car on the way somewhere, so that it wasn&#39;t an <br/>\nawkward &quot;We must talk about alcohol now,&quot; I said to Holly only (leaving Jasmine <br/>\nout and not asking her) &quot;I heard you drank a little at the party.&quot;    <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;More than a little,&quot; she said.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told her that I wanted to remind her that there seems to be a genetic <br/>\ncomponent, and that with only one alcoholic grandparent her risk was lower, she <br/>\nstill might inherit that alcoholism, and so she should be careful and aware <br/>\naround alcohol.    <br/>\n<br/>\nShe said, &quot;Okay.   Thanks.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJasmine said, &quot;Yes, thank you.   I hadn&#39;t heard that it might be genetic.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know all of Jasmine&#39;s grandparents, and as far as I know only her maternal <br/>\ngrandmother is alcoholic.   I mentioned that.   I said &quot;Both you and Holly <br/>\nhave one maternal grandmother.&quot;    So that was a little bonding <br/>\nsecond-and-a-half, and I still didn&#39;t ask Jasmine if she drank or how much.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo because Holly said &quot;more than a little&quot; I was picturing the worst, but <br/>\nstill it didn&#39;t matter in the context of all of it.    <br/>\n<br/>\nA week or so later it came up again, with only me and Holly there, and I <br/>\nasked if she had gotten drunk or sick, and she said no, neither, and in describing <br/>\nwhat she tasted and drank, I don&#39;t think it was over three or four ounces.   <br/>\nSo her &quot;more than a little&quot; meant &quot;more than a sip&quot; but to me, growing up and <br/>\nseeing people REALLY drink, I had imagined her to have been sloshed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to the issue of people having trouble with older relatives changing <br/>\nbehaviors, it might be worth considering substances too.   If they&#39;ve just gone on <br/>\nor off a drug is one possibility, but if they used to drink too much or abuse <br/>\nsomething else, or if they&#39;ve just stopped smoking, those things are almost <br/>\nguaranteed to make them mean. &lt;g&gt;   It takes a while to stabilize.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110161,"nextTopicId":110202}}
