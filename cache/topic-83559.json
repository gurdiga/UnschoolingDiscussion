You know, the decisions we make as <br/>\nparents affect so much more than ourselves and our immediate <br/>\nfamilies.  They affect other people too -- parents of our childrens&#39; <br/>\nfriends, for instance, especially those who don&#39;t parent the same way <br/>\nwe do, and then divisions happen.  I&#39;m watching an old friendship <br/>\ndie, and a potential one wither, and it makes me very sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have always practiced what I call respectful parenting.  We have <br/>\ntried our best, over the years, not to be authoritarian in any way, <br/>\nbut to engender an atmosphere of mutual respect in our home.  As a <br/>\nresult, we have often allowed our children to make their own <br/>\nmistakes, and then helped them to learn how to maturely face the <br/>\nconsequences of their actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, my dd, Nikki, is now 18 and is off at college.  We were unable <br/>\nto get her on-campus housing, so against our initial instincts, <br/>\nrented her an apartment near campus.  Her best friend attends the <br/>\nsame school, and got on the dorm list early enough.  We adore this <br/>\ngirl -- she is almost like a second daughter to us, and we have made <br/>\ngood friends with her single mother, though we have sometimes quietly <br/>\nquestioned her parenting style.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, a month ago our dd informed us that she wants to have her <br/>\nboyfriend move in with her.  Surprisingly, I wasn&#39;t as distressed by <br/>\nthe news as I always imagined I might be.  I figure, if she&#39;s going <br/>\nto be sleeping with a long-term (almost a year) boyfriend anyway, why <br/>\nnot be honest about it?  I really would prefer that she not make this <br/>\ndecision at this time -- I wish she&#39;d waited awhile, but the fact of <br/>\nthe matter is that she&#39;s in this intense relationship, and things are <br/>\ngoing to happen no matter what we say or do.  We&#39;ve talked about <br/>\nstaying focused on priorities and about self-protection, and about <br/>\nall those other things, but basically this is her decision.  Yes, we <br/>\nare paying her rent, but if we refused to allow this, he&#39;d just be <br/>\nthere all the time anyway.  What are we going to do -- put her into a <br/>\nchastity belt?  Even if she were in the dorm, they&#39;d be finding <br/>\nways.  I was 18 once, too.  I remember.  I figure that we got 18 <br/>\nyears to help her to develop an internal moral, ethical, <br/>\npsychologically mature compass (or to begin to).  Now she&#39;s got to <br/>\nfigure it out on her own.  And we&#39;re here to help, support, and love <br/>\nher as she stumbles through it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just found out today that her friend&#39;s mother has pronounced Nikki <br/>\na slut, and has forbidden her daughter to have anything more to do <br/>\nwith her.  (Yeah, like that&#39;s going to happen.) What makes me so sad <br/>\nabout this is that last year, when her daughter had a miscarriage <br/>\nafter an unplanned pregnancy, we stood by Nik&#39;s friend and loved her <br/>\nthrough the trauma of it all.  We have encouraged and supported her <br/>\nas her mother has called her fat, has refused to get her help for <br/>\nlearning disabilities in school, has grounded her for bad grades, <br/>\nblah, blah, blah.  And she has the nerve to call my daughter a slut <br/>\nand to write her off, just like that, after all these years of <br/>\nsupposedly caring for her too?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had something similar (in a way) to this happen recently to my <br/>\nson, too.  He&#39;s 15, still at home, very independent thinking.  He <br/>\nplayed a joke at a party a couple of months ago, patterned on <br/>\nsomething he&#39;d seen on a stupid TV show that he likes to watch -- I <br/>\nthink it&#39;s called *Jackass.*  Just silly juvenile stuff, but actually <br/>\npretty funny, I thought, when he told me about it.  He sniffed dried <br/>\nmustard as a stunt.  He didn&#39;t do it to try to get high or anything, <br/>\nhe was just being silly.  He&#39;s 15.  Wrong.  The parents of the boy <br/>\nwho was hosting the party are traditional school-at-homers, and <br/>\nthey&#39;ve decided that my ds is a bad influence on their precious boy --<br/>\n will lead him off into a druggie lifestyle or something.  He is no <br/>\nlonger welcome at their house.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen in the WORLD did I become such a bad parent?  I have two <br/>\nchildren who love and respect me and their dad, who are responsible <br/>\nand fun to be with.  They care about themselves, others, and the <br/>\nworld they live in.  They have hopes and plans for the future.  They <br/>\ndream big.  And they think for themselves.  They are independent.  <br/>\nHave wild senses of humor. (MUSTARD?!)  They have seen love modeled <br/>\nin their home and believe that they have the right to experience that <br/>\nsort of love, themselves, and are not afraid to take a risk, to go <br/>\nafter it.  I happen to think they&#39;re pretty cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is it that, by choosing this path of respectful parenting, I now <br/>\nam having to cushion my loving, fresh, free children from the <br/>\ncriticism of a world that says there&#39;s something wrong with them?<br/>\n<br/>\nGrrr.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura B.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83561,"nextTopicId":83584}}
