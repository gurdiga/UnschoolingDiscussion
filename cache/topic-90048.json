For two reasons, one to do with unschooling my <br/>\nson and the other with my own personal battle with my &quot;success&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst my son.  After a year of homeschooling and then unschooling <br/>\nwe&#39;re still feeling our way.  He is enjoying unschooling. I love the <br/>\nway he does things now for joy instead of obligation.  He still <br/>\nreads, he still does math and science. The diiference is that he <br/>\ndoes it because he WANTS to and not in the traditional ways.  This <br/>\nweek he&#39;s been reading his Nicktoons magazine. I was amazed at how <br/>\nwell he reads now! We&#39;ve been playing Monopoly and Zoombinis. He <br/>\nplays with magnets and makes weird concoctions in the yard.  He&#39;s <br/>\ninto Bible stories.  His whole face lights up when he&#39;s describing <br/>\nsome Bible character that he learned about. The funny thing is that <br/>\nI don&#39;t read the Bible with him.  He knows way more than me on that <br/>\nsubject though and loves to &quot;teach&quot; me a thing or two!  He still <br/>\nmentions school alot, and I&#39;m hoping and waiting for this to pass.  <br/>\nFor him it&#39;s really about the social aspect of it. But I think in <br/>\nthe year that he&#39;s been out he&#39;s forgotten what it was really like <br/>\nat school.  He was getting kicked in the stomach.  None of his <br/>\nclassmates were actual playmates.  They were mostly bussed in from <br/>\nother neighborhoods. His class didn&#39;t get to do any extra activities <br/>\nbecause they were so disruptive.  I think he&#39;s looking at school <br/>\nwith &quot;rose colored glasses&quot; and that&#39;s why he still mentions it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen the parallel between unschooling and my &quot;career&quot;.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen pondering the question &quot;What am I really good at?&quot;  You see, I <br/>\nwent back to work full time because of financial reasons.  I work <br/>\nfor decent people. My job is not horrible. But it offers no personal <br/>\nfulfillment.  I am not great at it because I have no personal <br/>\ninvestment in it. Am I being a good example to my kids by staying <br/>\nwith something that doesn&#39;t offer me joy?  Isn&#39;t that one of the <br/>\nbasis of unschooling?  How do I tell them that learning should be a <br/>\njoy and not a chore and then go off to a job that doesn&#39;t give me <br/>\nanything but money back?  It&#39;s been alot easier to take the leap of <br/>\nunschooling with my kids than to take that leap into the unknown <br/>\nwith my own career.

It was a big <br/>\ncommitment on my part to agree to drive him to the ski resort to teach snowboarding <br/>\nlessons. He was very excited about doing this and has remained committed the <br/>\nwhole season. I caught negative remarks from all around, family members who <br/>\nthought I was/am really putting myself out by doing this. It is about a 40 minute <br/>\ndrive each way, somedays I drop him off and go back for him depending on how <br/>\nlong he is to be there, we have been going there 5 years just for <br/>\nentertainment (I don&#39;t ski) so I am REALLY sick of this place and in no way shape or form <br/>\ndo I like sitting and waiting there but I do it. It is cold and uncomfortable <br/>\n(hard plastic chairs) and on some nights like last Friday there are 1500 <br/>\nmiddle school kids there with their schools club. UGH!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had to take him to training meetings also, replaced a lost pair of <br/>\ngoggles ($30 and the money is not why I encourage this, the money is lousy) and <br/>\neven had to make a trip to the ER one day he wiped out. He was fine but felt he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t teach the rest of the day, kind of reminded me of school, he was <br/>\ntold if felt unable to complete his shift then he needed to go to the ER via <br/>\nemergency squad. (over $200 if my insurance doesn&#39;t cover it) He was bruised but <br/>\nnot broken for which I am thankful but I think they knew that already at the <br/>\nski resort. It might help to know that he is paid by the lesson not the hour. <br/>\nFriday night his binding broke, I think it was because it was so cold here, <br/>\nbelow zero. I have been able to show him how I value him because I tend to these <br/>\nthings right away, we went to our favorite ski store who recommended we go to <br/>\nthe place we purchased the bindings (not our favorite, LOL). We were thrilled <br/>\nthat they replaced them free of charge. We took care of this right away.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn spite of all of the bad this has been a wonderful experience for him. He <br/>\nhas learned a lot and is having fun being there. He loves to snowboard and it <br/>\nhas given him and I a lot of one on one time in the car. He has thanked me many <br/>\ntimes for taking him. Even the unpleasant incidents have been good as they <br/>\nhave provided the opportunity to show him how much I care and he has responded <br/>\nwith gratitude but not only that, it has gone farther, our whole relationship <br/>\nhas been affected and has improved.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a long winded example of what has been working for me with my more <br/>\nchallenging child. It would be very hard to tell anyone exactly what to do <br/>\nbecause we and our kids are all so different.

She does have an official ADHD diagnosis, but when she went to school they also came out with &quot;obsessive-compulsive,&quot; &quot;oppositional-defiance&quot; and possibly Asperger&#39;s. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen Sarah was very young we were very AP and unschooly...but somewhere around the age of 4, and I&#39;m not really sure why, we started becoming very strict with her and went more traditional. So yeah, she has become very oppositional, etc. and I think it&#39;s more that the changes in our parenting really bothered her (as it did us and we have returned to what was working so well before!). <br/>\n <br/>\nBut she is still working through alot of the problems, and has made major improvements since coming home, but especially since beginning to completely unschool and AP. <br/>\n <br/>\nI do worry that someday she&#39;ll end up &quot;a bum&quot; or something because we never &quot;made&quot; her do anything, or that she&#39;ll say she hates me for not letting her go to school and &quot;be normal&quot; or any number of versions of that. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m trying to hang in there, realize she&#39;s still very much deschooling. I&#39;m also learning to listen to her again. I also realize that attendence in a government school is NOT a guarantee that she will succeed in life, and would very well only cause many more problems than she has right now. She&#39;s becoming my happy little girl again.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s going to be a process, and all I can do is guide her. I really have my moments of doubt and everything right now...but I try to stay focused on how much more she is smiling these days. <br/>\n <br/>\nI can&#39;t sympathize with some of your struggles with your daughter in regards to her health concerns and such, but the best advice I&#39;ve been given was to remember to look at her for who she IS rather than who she is NOT. I take time each day to sit and snuggle with her, and tell her something I like about her, something I enjoyed that day about her and things along that lines. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m glad to hear that you&#39;re doing the same, just take a deep breath and hang in there!!!

Now I&#39;m convinced she is just plain old Passive-<br/>\nAggressive. Stubborn, procrastinates, makes excuses, blames others <br/>\nfor her problems, doesn&#39;t take much accountability, promises to <br/>\nchange and and begs for second chances, and get&#39;s into a &quot;poor me&quot; <br/>\nspeech. So much negativity and and manipulation, lots of faulty <br/>\nthinking patterns (extreme all or none, magnification, projection, <br/>\ndenial, can you tell i loved psychology at one point?)<br/>\n<br/>\nmy kid is not all bad. she has improved some things since she came <br/>\nhome from school. like the encopresis(chronic constipation and <br/>\nsoiling because she refused to go to the bathroom on time) and <br/>\nenuresis(daytime leaking urine) but some days it&#39;s hard to remember <br/>\nthe all the good things about her. it&#39;s hard to talk about all this.<br/>\n<br/>\nwe are coming up on two years unschooling, and i have seen some <br/>\npromising results, like she gets motivated to learn things or take <br/>\ncare of her hygeine. but most times she doesn&#39;t finish what she <br/>\nstarts. i really try not to place too many expectations on her, but i <br/>\nreally worry that by unschooling i am giving her a free pass to make <br/>\nexcuses and do nothing with her life. and that someday she will blame <br/>\nme for it all, for not making her. she&#39;s very good at trying to turn <br/>\nthings around and blame others for things she won&#39;t do. <br/>\n<br/>\ni believe in unschooling, i truly do, but are their some kids that <br/>\nneed a little more direction? i can just see it now, some day she <br/>\nwill refuse to get a job and support herself because no one ever made <br/>\nher do anything. these are my worst fears intimidating me, but i <br/>\ncould use some new insight. <br/>\n<br/>\nshe displays such tough personality issues that you don&#39;t see much in <br/>\nchildren. at least from my perspective. is there any merit to <br/>\ntherapy? i tend to eschew psychologists and psychiatrists, even with <br/>\nmy own mood problems, but i don&#39;t want to make excuses if she truly <br/>\nneeds outside help. <br/>\n<br/>\ndoes anyone have a child like this? how do you unschool when at the <br/>\nworst moments you wish they would go back to school because it&#39;s not <br/>\nfair the problems she causes to the younger siblings during the day, <br/>\nbecause of her antics? when you tell her, look, i don&#39;t have to keep <br/>\nyou home to be abusive to the rest of the family. she is not <br/>\nphysically abusive, but she is really good at emotional blackmail and <br/>\nsucking me into power struggles. i wish i was better at not taking <br/>\nher bait, but damn she&#39;s good, and i am not stupid. <br/>\n<br/>\nshe hates when i am right about anything, and loves trying to prove <br/>\nme wrong. very argumentative. i used to tell myself that she would <br/>\nmake a good lawyer, but not if she is always going to be in comtempt <br/>\nfor any authority. she&#39;s an incredible kid, she really is. but i am <br/>\nstuck in frustration now. the doubts are drowning out the the hope. <br/>\n<br/>\ni have tried replacing good descriptions for the bad, focusing on the <br/>\npositive, like she is persistent, highly selective, outgoing, and so <br/>\nforth, things that could serve her well if properly channeled. but <br/>\nhow does that work with unschooling? i know deep down that school <br/>\nisn&#39;t the answer, but she can be such a drain. she wears me out. <br/>\n<br/>\nhelp? thanks for listening. <br/>\n<br/>\nang<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

I was asked <br/>\nnonstop as to if I went. In the end I was beaten by my father and ended up in <br/>\nBoston Children&#39;s because of my bowels.

Labels are dangerous, though I can understand the temptation to use them if they offer coping strategies along with the label. I just checked out Dr. Sears&#39;s book on ADD, and was seriously disappointed in the kinds of strategies he suggested. The book _Raising Your Spirited Child_ was far better, imo, and it sounds like you&#39;re already implementing many of those suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you looked into the possibility of food allergies? I&#39;m new to this myself, so there may be people who can speak to it with more experience than I. You might want to begin by checking out Doris Rapp&#39;s book _Is this Your Child?_; she has loads of information in there for all aged children. Also, check out the Feingold website if you haven&#39;t already www.feingold.org . There&#39;s much controversy surrounding the effects of food allergies on behavior, but lots of anecdotal evidence offered by parents (along with several studies) supports the link. The two things the caught my eye in your post were the constipation and enuresis--these are two very likely signs of food issues. Of course, they could also be related to the fact that elimination has been turned into a power struggle or just the way her body is working (you can find a thread on this in the archives). *shrug* No hard and fast answers, just suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, elimination diets have been shown to help with ADD/ ADHD tendencies as well as autistic tendencies. My guy (3.5) would definitely be labeled ADHD if he were in the school system, and he has more than his fair share of aggression issues. Right now we&#39;re in the elimination part of the diet, where we eliminate all the possible allergens. Soon, we&#39;ll get to the challenge part of the diet, where we reintroduce things one at a time to see if he does, in fact, react behaviorally. Once we&#39;ve done that, we will hopefully have narrowed down and identified all his triggers if they truly are related to food. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn all sincerity, we have already seen a *tremendous* improvement in his behavior. His tantrums have gone from 5-7 a day lasting from 15-30 min. to maybe 1-3 a day lasting for 1-3 minutes. They&#39;ve also diminished in intensity--no hitting, biting, kicking or throwing involved. Now, he can be calmed and comforted whereas in the past he could not. These are *huge* improvements for everyone in the family!  Allergic kids I&#39;ve spoken to describe reactions as like trying to crawl out of your skin or watching yourself decompose from the outside as a rational being but being unable to do anything to stop it. The only thing I can relate it to is PMS gone really bad. *g* Lots of times sensitivities like this don&#39;t show up on traditional allergy tests, so elimination and challenge are the only way really to test at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, the allergy/ sensitivity road is hard, and it comes at a pretty high cost. It is very difficult to eliminate things completely from a child&#39;s diet, and it affects everyone in the family. You have to completely rethink how you cook, the kinds of things you have in your house. Honestly, it sucks. I guess that once you get used to it, it probably becomes second nature. But until then, it&#39;s a struggle. But in my opinion, it&#39;s a far better road to try than psychiatrists and medication. If an elimination diet helps, and my guy is happier, then it will all be worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, I just posted my own story and struggle at the unschooling.com boards in the special needs folder. Just thought I&#39;d offer this in case it might be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] my kid","postDate":"1075660169","msgId":90057,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjMC4xNDdjMTQwMS4yZDRlOWY4OUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":90054,"nextInTopic":90061,"prevInTime":90056,"nextInTime":90058,"topicId":90048,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/1/04 8:16:03 AM, unolist@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-692078242\">In a message dated 2/1/04 8:16:03 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unolist@...\">unolist@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Stubborn, procrastinates, makes excuses, blames others <br/>\n<br/>\nfor her problems, doesn&#39;t take much accountability, promises to <br/>\n<br/>\nchange and and begs for second chances, and get&#39;s into a &quot;poor me&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nspeech.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are you trying to get her to do that she&#39;s stubbornly procrastinating <br/>\nabout?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you should take a session of aikido to make up for some of that excess <br/>\nof psychology!

Maybe in your <br/>\nown future defense you should start keeping little summaries of her <br/>\nimprovements and your concerns and your relief that she isn&#39;t having to suffer the <br/>\ncruelty of kids and teachers at school.   Make more than one copy. &lt;g&gt;  When she&#39;s <br/>\nolder, at first indication that she wants to blame you, hand her that &quot;report.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;i believe in unschooling, i truly do, but are their some kids that <br/>\n<br/>\nneed a little more direction?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn such cases I always think getting her out and about is best.  Take her for <br/>\nan overnight trip to another town.  See a show, or museum, or go to an <br/>\namusement park or something like tourists do.   Get a cheap motel room and go back <br/>\nto it early enough to watch a movie.   Eat at her favorite fast-food place.   <br/>\nLet it be a happy vacation. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it costs you $120 it&#39;s over and done and that&#39;s about what just the first <br/>\nvisit with a counselor would cost.   And if it makes any difference and gives <br/>\nyou happy shared experiences, that&#39;s WAY more than most first visits with <br/>\ncounsellors do.  And counsellors usually want you to come back over and over and <br/>\nover! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;i can just see it now, some day she <br/>\n<br/>\nwill refuse to get a job and support herself because no one ever made <br/>\n<br/>\nher do anything. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many kids who graduate high school are that way?<br/>\nAnd many who graduate college?!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-i can just see it now, some day she <br/>\n<br/>\nwill refuse to get a job and support herself because no one ever made <br/>\n<br/>\nher do anything. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNegativity sink-holes are a big problem.   I would try to shake her out of <br/>\nthe dark hole and into the light so she can start to dry out and move again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have to make sacrifices of time and money, it&#39;s better now than two or <br/>\nfive years out.  If she broke a leg, you&#39;d take her to an emergency room <br/>\nwithout saying, &quot;Wait, how much?  Can we just let it heal on its own at home?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think therapy is the best first move, though.  I think an amusement <br/>\npark and a motel room would be better.  But don&#39;t take the whole family.  And <br/>\ngo somewhere where you&#39;ll have fun even if she holds her breath and looks away <br/>\nthe whole time.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;she hates when i am right about anything&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell duh.  Stop being right so much.  Stop expressing phase one of &quot;i told <br/>\nyou so&quot; if you can possibly help it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;how do you unschool when at the <br/>\n<br/>\nworst moments you wish they would go back to school because it&#39;s not <br/>\n<br/>\nfair the problems she causes to the younger siblings during the day, <br/>\n<br/>\nbecause of her antics? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWorst case, I WOULD send a kid to school for the peace and safety of the <br/>\nother kids.<br/>\nDid she want to come home?  If she wanted to, remind her.  If you brought her <br/>\nhome against her will, you might have caused the problem yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuesses, all, but maybe some will help a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":6770123,"authorName":"BonKnit@aol.com","from":"BonKnit@...","profile":"pampmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] my kid","postDate":"1075655757","msgId":90054,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwNS4zZWI1MzIyNy4yZDRlOGU0ZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":90051,"nextInTopic":90057,"prevInTime":90053,"nextInTime":90055,"topicId":90048,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/1/2004 9:15:58 AM Central Standard Time, unolist@aol.com ...

Now I&#39;m convinced she is just plain old Passive-<br/>\nAggressive.
