I didn&#39;t do ANYTHING.  My husband<br/>\nbrought a potty chair home one day when she was about 18 mos old.  I said,<br/>\n&quot;put it in the playroom, and I&#39;ll tell her what it&#39;s for.&quot;  I did.  She<br/>\nplayed with her dolls in it--every way, except the way it was intended!<br/>\nLOL... but the week she turned 2, she told me she didn&#39;t want to wear<br/>\ndiapers anymore, she wanted to use a potty like me.  (She has always been<br/>\nextremely verbal--I joke that I can&#39;t remember when she couldn&#39;t talk!)<br/>\nAnyway, that was that.  She never used a diaper again, even at night!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnie, the now 3 yo, is a completely different person with a totally<br/>\ndifferent maturation schedule for nearly everything!  I sometimes wonder if<br/>\nmy one year old will quite using diapers before her! LOL...Anyway, I, too<br/>\nhave gotten REALLY impatient with her, mostly because she has shown me that<br/>\nshe can remember to go potty, and if she is naked, she often does go for<br/>\nboth pee and poop.  But if she has anything on, she just goes in her pants.<br/>\nVery inconvenient for me, especially since she often insists on &quot;training&quot;<br/>\npants or panties.  I did realize about a month and a half ago, that I needed<br/>\nto quit showing any emotion about it at all, including happiness or<br/>\nexcitement when she goes in the potty.  I just say, &quot; You sound pleased with<br/>\nyourself!&quot; when she tells me she went on the potty, and leave it at that.<br/>\nPoker Face.  It&#39;s working.  She&#39;s going more often than ever, and we are all<br/>\na whole lot more relaxed.  She has been going around naked as much as<br/>\npossible and that is helping too.  I do mightily look forward to when she is<br/>\ngoing on the potty even when she has pants on.  OH, and I almost<br/>\nforgot...technically, she isn&#39;t using a &quot;potty&quot;. She also INSISTS on using<br/>\nthe big toilet, even though she is very short and can hardly reach (doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to use a stool either...sigh...), so I really have to help her<br/>\nalot....along with changing what seems like BAZILLIONS of cloth diapers with<br/>\nthe baby as well.  He is by far the most difficult to change of any of my<br/>\nkids, and more difficult than even my friends&#39; &quot;difficult changers&quot;.<br/>\nUgh...He&#39;s got some MOVES, I tell you!  Sometimes, I actually have to lay my<br/>\nlegs on top of his arms to keep him still enough to get a diaper on him.  I<br/>\nSO look forward to passing my prefolds along to someone else! haha...<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it will come.  I just have to BREATHE in the meantime!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Andrea<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;dinalauzon&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dlauzon32@...\">dlauzon32@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, June 26, 2004 7:55 PM<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] This whole potty-training thang.....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I have had 3 kids in diapers for 3.5 years now.
