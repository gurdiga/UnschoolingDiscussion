It&#39;s not universal, but it&#39;s largely on  semester <br/>\nof English 101 for writing (essays, exposition, reports) and then a  semester <br/>\nof English 102, which is commentary on readings.  Analytical  writing based <br/>\non short literature, articles--that varies.<br/>\n <br/>\nWith test scores such as ACT or SAT, sometimes new college students can  <br/>\n&quot;test out&quot; of those and go on to particular topics.  Few care to do  so.  English <br/>\nmajors sometimes like to pad their hours with easier things,  and those who <br/>\ndon&#39;t intend to take lots of English classes often take those two  (IF they&#39;re <br/>\nrequired) and no more, ever.<br/>\n <br/>\nA young friend of mine once said, in the midst of re-taking English  102 <br/>\nafter having failed it, that he was going to join the army as a paratrooper  <br/>\nbecause he hated that class so much.  He said &quot;I would rather jump out of  an <br/>\nairplane with a rifle than take English 102.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nBecause writing was easy for me, I enjoyed it.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102449,"nextTopicId":102445}}
