The Screaming Tree is a tree in the yard that you can go <br/>\nand scream at if you feel like it. You can also call it any name you <br/>\nwant :-).

But the angry dance is great - you know, jumping up and down and <br/>\nshaking your fists while saying things like &quot;I&#39;m SO angry!&quot;. I have <br/>\nbeen known to do that on occasion, which usually sets the kids to <br/>\ngiggling and gets everyone over it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we have pillows in most rooms of the house - on the couches, <br/>\nbeds, etc. and those are always good for throwing. Personally, I like <br/>\nto either throw things, or go off completely by myself if I&#39;m mad. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son likes to come and have me squeeze him into a little ball on my <br/>\nlap, as if he&#39;s becoming a baby again. Who knows, it works. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter doesn&#39;t want anyone to touch her or talk to her. Today in <br/>\nthe car she got really upset and angry and she declared it to <br/>\nbe &quot;Silent Time!!!!&quot; and even had me turn off the radio. After a few <br/>\nminutes, she said &quot;You can talk now and have music&quot;, and she was <br/>\ntotally fine. I thought that was amazing insight for a 3 y.o. She <br/>\nconstantly blows me away with her self-perception. I think she&#39;s on <br/>\nlike her 200th incarnation on earth or something, and I&#39;m only on <br/>\nnumber 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":80046248,"authorName":"Dalene and Andy","from":"&quot;Dalene and Andy&quot; &lt;mactier@...&gt;","profile":"mactiers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] anger management for a 5 year old","postDate":"1035173815","msgId":47081,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYWQwMWMyNzhiOCRiNTY5N2M2MCRiNTY5MzZkMkBocHBhdj4=","referencesHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjAuMjAwMjEwMjAxNDA4NDIuMDIyYjZlYzBAbWFpbC5nYWlhd29sZi5vcmc+"},"prevInTopic":47033,"nextInTopic":47086,"prevInTime":47080,"nextInTime":47082,"topicId":46973,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think this is an important topic, especially since so many adults seem to struggle with this too.

Personally I think the first thing to do is take a deep breath or count to ten and move away from whatever/ or whoever caused the anger, then to go off and do something that can help you calm down - that would greatly depend on the individual - some kids might prefer to do something calm like a puzzle or drawing, while others might need something more active like the trampoline or a punching bag. It would be worth exploring with one&#39;s own child what he/she could do to make him/her calm down. And then lastly I think that it might be a good skill to learn to return after one has calmed down, and use an I message to express your feelings. Especially if another person was involved, but even if the child&#39;s anger was caused by an object, he/she might just like to share his feelings with another person.<br/>\n<br/>\nDalene<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"hsmominoz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] anger management for a 5 year old","postDate":"1035151410","msgId":47033,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExMC4xYTY1MWM1MC4yYWU0ODIzMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47023,"nextInTopic":47081,"prevInTime":47032,"nextInTime":47034,"topicId":46973,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/20/02 11:09:28 AM Central Daylight Time, sheran@ptd.net ...
