That was what i got out of it.  <br/>\nThe government took control of what the TV was saying and turned it into <br/>\nmoronic stuff, so no one could think for themselves.  And books were outlawed.  <br/>\nFreedom was removed.  And the &quot;people allowed it.&quot;  Except for the few.

All<br/>\n&gt; the popular programs on tv--the competition programs--they donâ€™t give<br/>\n&gt; you anything but factoids.  They tell you when Napoleon was born, but<br/>\n&gt; not who he was.  So it doesnâ€™t matter about the dates, you shouldnâ€™t<br/>\n&gt; memorize dates, to hell with it.
