Much of it <br/>\nis already looking old and weary. &lt;g&gt;  If she follows her usual pattern, the <br/>\nmajority of it will be stuffed in a plastic bag and left to grow stale for a <br/>\nyear, till it gets pitched in the trash....<br/>\n<br/>\n   Younger daughter (the one who&#39;s always craved sweets; she used to walk <br/>\naround sucking on the plastic Honey Bear jar when a toddler!) dove into candy <br/>\nas if it were manna from heaven (despite never having any restrictions on <br/>\nfood choices around here,  in our daily lives), had consumed easily HALF of <br/>\nit in an orgy of sugar consumption within the first day, and ALL of it within <br/>\nabout four days.....she&#39;s moved on to other sweet pastures, already.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Her father eats sweets in the same fashion.  He&#39;s hypoglycemic, and <br/>\nbinges on occasion, when his blood sugar levels wrest control of his mind. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n Younger daughter exhibits the same reckless tendencies, often eating herself <br/>\ninto a manic high, or even--when she was smaller--THROWING UP from excess <br/>\nchocolate intake. <br/>\n<br/>\n  This despite *precisely* the same food lifestyle, freedom of choice, and <br/>\nnutritional offerings in the same household.  One daughter&#39;s physical make up <br/>\ngives her a &quot;problem&quot; with sugar; the other does not. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think one can attribute food behaviors  ALL to  child-rearing <br/>\npractices. People clearly have different physical relationships with food, <br/>\ntoo....My sister always has been able to subsist happily on a breakfast of <br/>\nbreadstuffs and caffeine (rolls and coffee, biscuits and tea, etc.).  I, on <br/>\nthe other hand, go into a complete nutritional nosedive unless I ingest <br/>\nPROTEIN asap in the morning: headaches, the &quot;shakes&quot;, etc..  Now, when I <br/>\nvisit her, I make sure to bring some cheese sticks or hardboiled eggs to <br/>\nsupplement her breakfast offerings, as she still forgets our differing <br/>\nnutritional needs sometimes.....I can understand that.  It&#39;s easy to mistake <br/>\none&#39;s OWN experience for that of others, too.  &quot;If a croissant and grapefruit <br/>\nkeep her perkin&#39; till lunchtime,&quot; why wouldn&#39;t it do the same for me?  ;-D<br/>\n<br/>\nBecky in Iowa<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we are <br/>\nto stand by the president right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and <br/>\nservile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.&quot;<br/>\n--Theodore Roosevelt<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54976,"nextTopicId":54910}}
