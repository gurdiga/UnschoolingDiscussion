I really didn&#39;t see the actual name calling, I <br/>\nonly saw the after effects, and the other teacher handling it.  I was <br/>\nthinking that I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d see such things at a homeschool park <br/>\nday, and I tried to figure out why.  I finally decided that the <br/>\nhomeschooled kids I know have not been torn down, they do not need <br/>\nothers to tell them they are worthy or good or valued members of their <br/>\nsociety, they don&#39;t spend hours upon hours with their &quot;peers&quot;, they <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel so shut down by a system that cannot succeed that they do not <br/>\nfeel the need to build themselves up by putting others down.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who are strong and have a sense of themselves and their value, <br/>\nname calling is nothing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kris<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
