Just plain old hugs, scratches behind the<br/>\nears and &quot;whatta good boy/girl you are&quot; was all that was needed for most of<br/>\nthe four legged kids.  Lots of socialization and free playtime as puppies<br/>\nmade for smart, emotionally well-balanced companions when they grew up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd lots of them were indeed individuals.
