I also hope to become an active part of the group ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOur older 3 kids take horseback lessons.  Yesterday at their<br/>\nlesson our 7 year old daughter was having trouble w/the horse<br/>\nand the trainer yelled at her &quot;Don&#39;t be scared, don&#39;t be a<br/>\nchicken!  Chicken, chicken!  Chicken, chicken! Chicken, chicken!&quot;<br/>\nThat is a quote.  Then dd started to ride over towards dh and I<br/>\nand the trainer told her to listen to her.  My dd yelled,<br/>\n&quot;NO! You&#39;re mean!&quot; through her tears and came over to me. I stayed<br/>\nby my dd&#39;s side until we walked the horse back to the barn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen my dd got down and started to walk to our truck.  The<br/>\ntrainer yelled at her &quot;Don&#39;t you walk away from me, don&#39;t you<br/>\ndisrespect me like that!  You say yes ma&#39;am!&quot;  BLah, blah....it&#39;s a<br/>\nlong story, I&#39;m<br/>\nsorry......bottom line is I had to explain to the trainer that<br/>\nwe didn&#39;t send our kids to school, partly so they didn&#39;t have to<br/>\nbe treated like that and called names.  I said especially with our<br/>\ngirls that we want them to be strong and stick up for themselves in<br/>\nthese situations.  That went over like a bag of crap w/the trainer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was nice at the time, but am steaming mad now that dh and I had<br/>\nthe night to process it.  We&#39;re new to southern Alabama, and not<br/>\nused to this kind of &quot;yes ma&#39;am&quot; atmosphere.  Obviously we are not<br/>\ngoing<br/>\nto spend our money at their barn anymore......should we leave w/out<br/>\nan explanation, or tell the owner how uncool our experience with<br/>\nher employee was?

I ll bet there are","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-543712890\">I would definitely speak to the barn owner and tell her why you are not<br/>\ncoming back.  Are there other trainers at the barn to choose from?  I&#39;ll bet<br/>\nthere are other barns within driving distance that are much more<br/>\nprofessional.  It isn&#39;t worth putting up with that and if you leave without<br/>\ntelling them why, the woman isn&#39;t going to learn anything from it.  My<br/>\ngirls&#39; instructor is just great.  She is gentle yet straight forward.  She<br/>\nis always respectful of the girls.  She pushes them just the right amount,<br/>\nbased on how they respond to her.  They have learned so much from her.  I<br/>\nhope you can find another instructor who will be respectful of your<br/>\nchildren.  We used to go to another barn and the instructor was very nice,<br/>\nbut I didn&#39;t know what we were missing until we switched barns.  The owner<br/>\nat the barn we go to know really knows her stuff and she asks a lot of the<br/>\nkids but within the limits that they can handle it.  Sounds like it&#39;s time<br/>\nto move on.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] new to posting, looking for advice","postDate":"1106871351","msgId":102816,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyM0IwQzIzLjY3OEQ3QTA4LjBCOTdBM0ZCQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":102811,"nextInTopic":102817,"prevInTime":102815,"nextInTime":102817,"topicId":102811,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/27/2005 4:07:20 PM Eastern Standard Time, cslkll  writes: We re new to southern Alabama, and not used to this kind","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1945916352\">In a message dated 1/27/2005 4:07:20 PM Eastern Standard Time, &quot;cslkll&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cslkll@...\">cslkll@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\nWe&#39;re new to southern Alabama, and not used to this kind of &quot;yes ma&#39;am&quot; atmosphere. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, we&#39;ve had this discussion may times before here and on other e-lists and at .com.

I&#39;ve been reading on this group for years.<br/>\nDh and I unschool our family (10ds, 7 & 8 dd, 1 baby).  My<br/>\nname is Krista and I have a dilema...and would like other<br/>\nopinions. I also hope to become an active part of the group ;-) <br/>\n<br/>\nOur older 3 kids take horseback lessons.  Yesterday at their<br/>\nlesson our 7 year old daughter was having trouble w/the horse<br/>\nand the trainer yelled at her &quot;Don&#39;t be scared, don&#39;t be a <br/>\nchicken!  Chicken, chicken!  Chicken, chicken! Chicken, chicken!&quot;<br/>\nThat is a quote.  Then dd started to ride over towards dh and I<br/>\nand the trainer told her to listen to her.  My dd yelled,<br/>\n&quot;NO! You&#39;re mean!&quot; through her tears and came over to me. I stayed<br/>\nby my dd&#39;s side until we walked the horse back to the barn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen my dd got down and started to walk to our truck.  The<br/>\ntrainer yelled at her &quot;Don&#39;t you walk away from me, don&#39;t you <br/>\ndisrespect me like that!  You say yes ma&#39;am!&quot;  BLah, blah....it&#39;s a <br/>\nlong story, I&#39;m<br/>\nsorry......bottom line is I had to explain to the trainer that <br/>\nwe didn&#39;t send our kids to school, partly so they didn&#39;t have to<br/>\nbe treated like that and called names.  I said especially with our<br/>\ngirls that we want them to be strong and stick up for themselves in<br/>\nthese situations.  That went over like a bag of crap w/the trainer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was nice at the time, but am steaming mad now that dh and I had<br/>\nthe night to process it.  We&#39;re new to southern Alabama, and not <br/>\nused to this kind of &quot;yes ma&#39;am&quot; atmosphere.  Obviously we are not <br/>\ngoing<br/>\nto spend our money at their barn anymore......should we leave w/out<br/>\nan explanation, or tell the owner how uncool our experience with<br/>\nher employee was?  There has been no previous problems there, but I <br/>\nfind this verbal abuse of my child 100% unacceptable.  Thanks in <br/>\nadvance &quot;y&#39;all&quot;!  ~krista<br/>\n<br/>\nPS....dh and I are actually proud of dd for not letting someone <br/>\ntalk to her that way.  DD is trying to save up for a nintendo ds and <br/>\nhas asked for ways to make extra money so she can get it faster.  Dh<br/>\ntold her good job for sticking up for herself and gave her some <br/>\nmoney towards her ds.  So, we are not upset w/her....at all...just <br/>\nwanted to clarify that :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102855,"nextTopicId":102864}}
