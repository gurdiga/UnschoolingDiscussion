I had just returned from a <br/>\nnurse practitioner conference. Drug company reps load you down with all sorts <br/>\nof stuff. My ds Eric loved to help go through everything. He discovered a <br/>\nposter of photos of the mouths of AIDS patients. Really graphic. I later <br/>\nfound the poster taped to his bathroom mirror. He wanted to see it everytime <br/>\nhe went to the bathroom to remind him of the consequences of poor dental <br/>\nhygiene. I reminded him that he was not immunocompromised and probably <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have such severe results from an occasional lack of brushing. He <br/>\nwanted it anyway. Kind of like a self-imposed &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; scenerio. I <br/>\nremoved it a few weeks later (the poster made his older sister gag everytime <br/>\nshe went in the br). Eric does a pretty good job of brushing his teeth. It&#39;s <br/>\nroutine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you&#39;ll not choose this technique, but I wanted to share this story. If <br/>\nyou haven&#39;t already, let her choose toothbrush and paste or even fluoride <br/>\nrinses. The kid market is being targeted heavily. Take advantage of it. Try <br/>\nbrushing with her. Don&#39;t make it a battle. Kids usually come to see the <br/>\nadvantages of oral hygiene on their own. If she has routine dentist visits, <br/>\nthis also helps. There are many kid-friendly dentists out there. Our <br/>\ndentist/hygienist make it fun for my two to come in. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nGinny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523757,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"Pam Hartley &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","profile":"pdhartley2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Need advice about child&#39;s responsibilities","postDate":"1034401350","msgId":46186,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBIM1UwMEFKWVQ2VVlaQG10YTUuc25mYzIxLnBiaS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":46182,"nextInTopic":46189,"prevInTime":46185,"nextInTime":46187,"topicId":46159,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Some they stick with, some they<br/>\ndon&#39;t, some they come back to later. My oldest, for example, has started<br/>\nclasses or concerted efforts to learn: gymnastics, ice skating, Irish dance,<br/>\nart, reading, and I know several other things I can&#39;t even remember right<br/>\nnow. She quit gymnastics, reading practice, and Irish dance after awhile<br/>\n(Irish dance after one lesson, and if you don&#39;t think that caused me agonies<br/>\nI had to suppress -- I mean come ON, I *LOVE* Riverdance &lt;gg&gt;) and quit and<br/>\nthen went back to ice skating. Her art classes were of limited duration only<br/>\nbecause the teacher stopped teaching and I am frankly terrified of finding<br/>\nher the &quot;wrong&quot; art teacher so I am taking a good deal of time over helping<br/>\nher get to new classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough all of this, she is not afraid to try new things that interest her,<br/>\nbecause she knows she CAN quit any time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many things have you started, as an adult, and felt free to quit when<br/>\nthey bored you? I have gone through phases of crocheting, cross-stitch,<br/>\nscrapbooking (likely to get back into that sometime), dog training (ditto),<br/>\ndog showing (could not pay me enough to go back) and many more. I quit at my<br/>\nwhim, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s made me a worse person. I stick with faithfully<br/>\nthe things I really love and believe in: my marriage, homeschooling,<br/>\nwriting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One issue we had awhile back was volunteer work.  We volunteer weekly<br/>\n&gt; at the local food bank.  It was fun for my daughter at first, but<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s losing interest.  It isn&#39;t exciting to her anymore.  She wanted<br/>\n&gt; to quit.  An adult can&#39;t quit their job because they don&#39;t feel like<br/>\n&gt; going to work anymore.  We have come to the agreement of only<br/>\n&gt; volunteering once a month, that makes us both happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>An adult CAN quit his or her job if they feel like it. There are natural<br/>\nconsequences and choices to be made as a result of it, but adults can and do<br/>\ncertainly do it all the time. I have quit jobs many times, for good and bad<br/>\nand indifferent reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am glad you were able to reach a compromise, but if she balks in future,<br/>\nconsider what a chore you may be making of helping people and the very real<br/>\npossibility that she will learn to NOT want to help people in the future if<br/>\nshe is forced now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; What if a child doesn&#39;t want to pick up their toys?

If it&#39;s your company, it&#39;s your cleaning problem. :) It would<br/>\nbe nice if they would help (and asked nicely, they probably will at least<br/>\nsometimes) but it was not their choice to have people come over and disturb<br/>\nall the lovely piles of things they&#39;ve accumulated on the couch. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; You need to go to the bank, but your child doesn&#39;t want to brush her<br/>\n&gt; teeth and get dressed, she wants to read.

Asking your husband to<br/>\ndo some banking at lunch is good. Online banking is lovely. Offering to do<br/>\nsomething your daughter enjoys while you are out doing what you have to do,<br/>\nor offering to do something for her at home that she likes in trade for<br/>\n&quot;coming along quietly&quot; is another good way (yes, you can call it a bribe. I<br/>\ncall it being nice to my children so they will want to be nice to me and<br/>\nnobody has to fight about the bank).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you can take a child wearing pajamas and harboring a stinky mouth into<br/>\na bank and nobody will arrest you. :) Some people will even smile, and<br/>\ncommiserate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am truly open to your thoughts, but this is new to me.

But<br/>\nlets say I feel this task does *have* to be done today - I would point<br/>\nout the reasons for that priority.  I might also ask how I can help my<br/>\nson/s (I only have boys) enjoy helping me meet this priority.  Perhaps<br/>\nthere is something exciting I can offer for t/he/m on the way back from<br/>\nthe bank?  Perhaps the preparation to leave is overwhelming - so maybe,<br/>\nconsidering the urgency and deadline, maybe we can take toothbrushes in<br/>\nthe car, maybe we can leave our teeth this time and check each other for<br/>\n*yucky* things in our teeth on our way out the door, maybe clothes can<br/>\ngo on over pjs, maybe we can wear easy outerclothes without<br/>\nunderclothes.  Reading can be done in the car, even in the bank.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have many neighbours but on one or two occasions, asking a nearby<br/>\nacquaintance to mind a child for an hour or so could be an avenue worth<br/>\nexploring.<br/>\n<br/>\nMica<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ghal9720@...\">ghal9720@...</a><br/>\nStawell, Victoria, Australia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1512150,"authorName":"Peggy","from":"Peggy &lt;peggy@...&gt;","profile":"margotapple","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Need advice about child&#39;s responsibilities","postDate":"1034397262","msgId":46180,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEQTdBNjRFLjdFMDMxQjVBQGxpbm1heC5zYW8uYXJpem9uYS5lZHU+","referencesHeader":"PGFvN2xrNis5bWVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46179,"nextInTopic":46182,"prevInTime":46179,"nextInTime":46181,"topicId":46159,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There s quite a bit in your post -- I m sure we could all go on for days about consequences and motivation and learning to be a self directed learner.

If communication has<br/>\nshut down this isn&#39;t going to happen. Keeping communication open between the<br/>\ntwo of you should be on the top of the priority list, way above learning<br/>\nresponsibility or teaching consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I&#39;ve noticed with my own volatile daughter is that she yells when<br/>\nshe feels like she isn&#39;t being heard.

I have always asked that she brush her<br/>\n&gt; teeth,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get dressed,  and make her bed in the morning.  After she<br/>\n&gt; completes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; those responsibilities, she is free to do whatever she chooses,<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; playing her violin, reading, watching tv, playing outside - the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; choice is hers.  This doesn&#39;t seem unreasonable to me.  I have<br/>\n&gt; been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reading many postings here, and am wondering if/how my &quot;requiring&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her to do ANYTHING (chores, responsitilies etc) might have an<br/>\n&gt; effect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on unschooling.  I don&#39;t require academics, or &quot;education&quot;, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; simple, basic hygiene etc.  Literally, if I didn&#39;t &quot;make&quot; her<br/>\n&gt; brush<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her teeth, she might not for a week.  (yuck!)  She battles me<br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; these basic things!  I have tried numerous things to get these<br/>\n&gt; things<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; taken care of, but could use any suggestions you may have.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When my daughters and I have a disagreement over basic<br/>\n&gt; hygiene/safety/health<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I tell them what I&#39;m worried about (cavities, etc.) We try to come<br/>\n&gt; to an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; agreement about when, how often, and if they want me to remind them<br/>\n&gt; and how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll approach it if they forget. There is nothing magical about<br/>\n&gt; hopping out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of bed and brushing teeth. If she does it once or twice a day<br/>\n&gt; sometime,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she&#39;ll get what benefit (and some say it&#39;s marginal benefit anyway,<br/>\n&gt; and that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cavities-or-not are more genetic than anything) there is to be had.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Getting dressed and making her bed are matters of neither hygiene<br/>\n&gt; nor health<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (well, unless she wants to play naked in a snowstorm &lt;g&gt;). Those are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; arguments I would drop like hot rocks. If her bed bothers you, make<br/>\n&gt; it. :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If seeing her in pjs until 3 p.m. bothers you, take deep breaths<br/>\n&gt; and learn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to overcome it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One more question, while I&#39;m at it.  How do you all deal with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disrespect?  Talking back, raising her voice to me, stomping,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; slamming doors - she gets very frustrated when things don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; go &quot;just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; right&quot;.  Yesterday it was violin.  She was playing, and didn&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the song perfect.  She started to get angry.  I suggested she put<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; away for a bit, and take it out later for a fresh start.  She<br/>\n&gt; slammed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; down the bow, knocked over her music stand in her huff, and<br/>\n&gt; slammed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her bedroom door.  I have repeatedly talked to her, to help her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; understand that it doesn&#39;t have to and isn&#39;t going to be perfect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everytime, etc etc...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This doesn&#39;t sound to me like disrespect. This sounds to me like<br/>\n&gt; she doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; want a lecture when she&#39;s feeling bad about violin. As a female with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; perfectionist tendencies myself ;) I understand that the worst<br/>\n&gt; thing someone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can do while I&#39;m in a huff over my own real or imagined<br/>\n&gt; inadequacies is try<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to talk rationally to me. Sympathy works better, &quot;I hate it when I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something right. Here, punch this pillow.&quot; Or just leaving me alone<br/>\n&gt; for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Later, after the slamming etc. is all done, she&#39;ll probably be more<br/>\n&gt; ready to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; talk calmly, but the conversation at that point might be about how<br/>\n&gt; you can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; help her learn to control her outburst and direct them toward<br/>\n&gt; acceptable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; outlets (scrubbing a bathtub in a huff or going into the yard and<br/>\n&gt; running<br/>\n&gt; &gt; around full speed are terrific, slamming doors and scaring the 3<br/>\n&gt; year old<br/>\n&gt; &gt; aren&#39;t). Telling her she shouldn&#39;t feel how she feels is not, IMHO,<br/>\n&gt; the most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; positive approach.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It isn&#39;t healthy for any of us to endure her attitude, (I also<br/>\n&gt; have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3 year old boy that is copying her behaviors), there should be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consequences for her actions.  When she gets angry because her<br/>\n&gt; game<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; isn&#39;t going well, she slams the playstation.  I take away her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; playstation for the day - the punishment fits the crime.  But what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about general disrespect or attitude?  She pushing to see what the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; limits are, that&#39;s for sure.  Sometimes I wonder if she thinks she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t have to listen to me, because she thinks she&#39;s as smart as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think punishment in general is a really, really bad idea. If your<br/>\n&gt; husband<br/>\n&gt; &gt; slams the front door because he&#39;s had a terrible day at work, do<br/>\n&gt; you take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; away his door privileges? If you have an awful day and toss your<br/>\n&gt; earrings at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the wall, are you denied jewelry for a certain period of time?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Respect begets respect, and parents have to first show it to<br/>\n&gt; children before<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they will get it back from the children. They learn by what we do<br/>\n&gt; to them,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not what we say they should do. If you punish her, she&#39;ll want to<br/>\n&gt; punish<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you. If you try to control her (bed making, dressing, toothbrushing<br/>\n&gt; to your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; timetable), she&#39;ll do what she can to seize back what control she<br/>\n&gt; can.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you sympathize with her pain, stop her from actually harming<br/>\n&gt; herself and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; others while not telling her the feelings themselves are wrong,<br/>\n&gt; just her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expression of them could use some work, I think you&#39;ll see a more<br/>\n&gt; positive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; response.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Best wishes,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Pam<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

Does she have her own toddler-free <br/>\nspace? Are they left on their own a lot or are you most always <br/>\nthere?) Yelling at him, ditto.

In that case, I&#39;d be keeping tabs on <br/>\nthe 3 year old and keeping his peskiness to a low level while you <br/>\nall sort this out together.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlamming doors and damaging walls are a much less serious <br/>\nproposition. I might sit down with her in calm times and suggest <br/>\nother steam-releasing things she can do -- whatever seems to fit <br/>\nand work for her, whether it&#39;s exercise, hanging a punching bag <br/>\nin the garage, or whatever. I might ask her nicely if she&#39;d help me <br/>\nfix the wall, but would not make a big thing of it if she didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto.

She doesn&#39;t budge.  She <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to go.  She&#39;s not listening to reason.  She&#39;s not old <br/>\nenough to be left alone, and the bank closes in 1/2 hour.  <br/>\nConsequences or punishment certainly seems in order, you&#39;ve got to <br/>\nget the results you need, and fast!  (or is there another way, please <br/>\nshare with me!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am truly open to your thoughts, but this is new to me.  I have <br/>\nconsequences on the brain, and I need deprogramming!  Unschooling is <br/>\nwonderful and free, but I don&#39;t want my daughter to run the <br/>\nhousehold, where we adjust to her moods.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., Pam Hartley &lt;pamhartley@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &#92;&gt; My question is this.

When she gets angry because her <br/>\ngame<br/>\n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t going well, she slams the playstation.  I take away her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; playstation for the day - the punishment fits the crime.  But what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about general disrespect or attitude?  She pushing to see what the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; limits are, that&#39;s for sure.  Sometimes I wonder if she thinks she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t have to listen to me, because she thinks she&#39;s as smart as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think punishment in general is a really, really bad idea. If your <br/>\nhusband<br/>\n&gt; slams the front door because he&#39;s had a terrible day at work, do <br/>\nyou take<br/>\n&gt; away his door privileges? If you have an awful day and toss your <br/>\nearrings at<br/>\n&gt; the wall, are you denied jewelry for a certain period of time?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Respect begets respect, and parents have to first show it to <br/>\nchildren before<br/>\n&gt; they will get it back from the children. They learn by what we do <br/>\nto them,<br/>\n&gt; not what we say they should do. If you punish her, she&#39;ll want to <br/>\npunish<br/>\n&gt; you. If you try to control her (bed making, dressing, toothbrushing <br/>\nto your<br/>\n&gt; timetable), she&#39;ll do what she can to seize back what control she <br/>\ncan.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you sympathize with her pain, stop her from actually harming <br/>\nherself and<br/>\n&gt; others while not telling her the feelings themselves are wrong, <br/>\njust her<br/>\n&gt; expression of them could use some work, I think you&#39;ll see a more <br/>\npositive<br/>\n&gt; response.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Best wishes,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pam </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100122184,"authorName":"Lisa M.

Here is my<br/>\nperspective:  I view teeth brushing as very very important, even<br/>\nessential to the health of our teeth.  Since I don&#39;t want any of us to<br/>\nget cavities, I say something like, &quot;Let&#39;s go brush our teeth.  Mine<br/>\nfeel grody [they do, too, or I wouldn&#39;t say it].  Do yours?  Let&#39;s get<br/>\nthem all clean.&quot;  Then, we all go and brush our teeth.  We do this<br/>\nsometime in the morning hours (usually) and before bed (always).  I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t wake a sleeping child to do this, but I feel that it is<br/>\nessential for the awake kid&#39;s to do it.  My kids are only 6 and 2, so<br/>\nthey aren&#39;t quite able to _properly_ do this themselves, but the 6 yo is<br/>\nclose and she does her own in the morning and I do touch ups after she<br/>\ndoes her own at bedtime.  If she didn&#39;t brush her teeth, I honestly<br/>\nbelieve that she&#39;d get cavities.  We&#39;ve talked about this and how they<br/>\nwould feel, how it would be at the dentists and the large amount of<br/>\nmoney and time it would cost the whole family.  She doesn&#39;t balk it at<br/>\nall, but she usually has to be reminded.  As for the two year old, she<br/>\nwants to be like her sister so she is usually pretty easy.  With my 6<br/>\nyo, we had a problem with her and brushing for a while when she was<br/>\nyounger and consistency was the key with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for bedmaking.  We only make our beds two times in our house (and<br/>\neven then it is pretty sloppily made):  when the sheets have just been<br/>\nwashed and when company is coming that will see the bed.  I read<br/>\nsomewhere once that making a bed can cause asthma.  Something about the<br/>\nbedmites thriving on the sweat of humans and the dampness of the bed<br/>\ngrowing into mold, etc. when the sheets are covered, but that when the<br/>\ncovers are left open they dry and so the mites can&#39;t grow.  I don&#39;t know<br/>\nall the details, but I can see how this could be true and I use it as an<br/>\nexcuse since asthma runs in my family and I&#39;ve done everything else<br/>\npossible to prevent it in my kids, so why not this, too?  I don&#39;t mind<br/>\nsince I hate making beds.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for getting dressed, sometimes none of us get dressed for the day. <br/>\nIt can be more relaxing that way.  When we are going somewhere, I&#39;ll say<br/>\nsomething like,&quot;Let&#39;s go put on some pretty clothes to go to the library<br/>\n(or wherever)&quot; and I always get compliance.  I think it is because my<br/>\n6yo LOVES to dress pretty.   She usually picks out all of our outfits,<br/>\nactually, since she loves it so much.  DH had her picking out his shirts<br/>\nto wear for the day when she was just a few months old.  He appreciates<br/>\nit since he hates doing it and she loves to get us all matching and<br/>\ncolor coordinated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bet your daughter would be really shocked if you told her that she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to make her bed or get dressed for the day!  She&#39;d probably<br/>\ntest you on it a few times and then do it herself (especially the<br/>\ngetting dressed part).  Could you go in and brush your teeth at the same<br/>\ntime as her in the morning?  Could you maybe have her brush your teeth<br/>\nor something equally funny to her?  Does she get to pick out her own<br/>\ntoothbrush and toothpaste?  It took me a couple of years to figure out<br/>\nthat my daughter hated the taste of mint and that is why she didn&#39;t want<br/>\nto brush her teeth.  She loves the strawberry though, and I think it is<br/>\ndisgusting.  She&#39;s also really into pretty things, so paying extra for a<br/>\n&quot;pretty&quot; toothbrush is worth it to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lisa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523757,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"Pam Hartley &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","profile":"pdhartley2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Need advice about child&#39;s responsibilities","postDate":"1034360771","msgId":46159,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBIM1QwMEM1Q1hWTlVaQG10YTUuc25mYzIxLnBiaS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46162,"prevInTime":46158,"nextInTime":46160,"topicId":46159,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" My question is this.

I have always asked that she brush her teeth, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; get dressed,  and make her bed in the morning.  After she completes<br/>\n&gt; those responsibilities, she is free to do whatever she chooses, from<br/>\n&gt; playing her violin, reading, watching tv, playing outside - the<br/>\n&gt; choice is hers.  This doesn&#39;t seem unreasonable to me.  I have been<br/>\n&gt; reading many postings here, and am wondering if/how my &quot;requiring&quot;<br/>\n&gt; her to do ANYTHING (chores, responsitilies etc) might have an effect<br/>\n&gt; on unschooling.  I don&#39;t require academics, or &quot;education&quot;, but<br/>\n&gt; simple, basic hygiene etc.  Literally, if I didn&#39;t &quot;make&quot; her brush<br/>\n&gt; her teeth, she might not for a week.  (yuck!)  She battles me about<br/>\n&gt; these basic things!  I have tried numerous things to get these things<br/>\n&gt; taken care of, but could use any suggestions you may have.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When my daughters and I have a disagreement over basic hygiene/safety/health<br/>\nI tell them what I&#39;m worried about (cavities, etc.) We try to come to an<br/>\nagreement about when, how often, and if they want me to remind them and how<br/>\nI&#39;ll approach it if they forget. There is nothing magical about hopping out<br/>\nof bed and brushing teeth. If she does it once or twice a day sometime,<br/>\nshe&#39;ll get what benefit (and some say it&#39;s marginal benefit anyway, and that<br/>\ncavities-or-not are more genetic than anything) there is to be had.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting dressed and making her bed are matters of neither hygiene nor health<br/>\n(well, unless she wants to play naked in a snowstorm &lt;g&gt;). Those are<br/>\narguments I would drop like hot rocks. If her bed bothers you, make it. :)<br/>\nIf seeing her in pjs until 3 p.m. bothers you, take deep breaths and learn<br/>\nto overcome it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; One more question, while I&#39;m at it.  How do you all deal with<br/>\n&gt; disrespect?  Talking back, raising her voice to me, stomping,<br/>\n&gt; slamming doors - she gets very frustrated when things don&#39;t go &quot;just<br/>\n&gt; right&quot;.  Yesterday it was violin.  She was playing, and didn&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; the song perfect.  She started to get angry.  I suggested she put it<br/>\n&gt; away for a bit, and take it out later for a fresh start.  She slammed<br/>\n&gt; down the bow, knocked over her music stand in her huff, and slammed<br/>\n&gt; her bedroom door.  I have repeatedly talked to her, to help her<br/>\n&gt; understand that it doesn&#39;t have to and isn&#39;t going to be perfect<br/>\n&gt; everytime, etc etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This doesn&#39;t sound to me like disrespect. This sounds to me like she doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant a lecture when she&#39;s feeling bad about violin. As a female with<br/>\nperfectionist tendencies myself ;) I understand that the worst thing someone<br/>\ncan do while I&#39;m in a huff over my own real or imagined inadequacies is try<br/>\nto talk rationally to me. Sympathy works better, &quot;I hate it when I don&#39;t get<br/>\nsomething right. Here, punch this pillow.&quot; Or just leaving me alone for a<br/>\nbit.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, after the slamming etc. is all done, she&#39;ll probably be more ready to<br/>\ntalk calmly, but the conversation at that point might be about how you can<br/>\nhelp her learn to control her outburst and direct them toward acceptable<br/>\noutlets (scrubbing a bathtub in a huff or going into the yard and running<br/>\naround full speed are terrific, slamming doors and scaring the 3 year old<br/>\naren&#39;t).
