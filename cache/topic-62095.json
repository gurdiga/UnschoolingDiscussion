I belong to a summer softball team that is composed mostly of middle <br/>\naged moms and we went to this as a &quot;post season&quot; activity. It was great to <br/>\nsee the movie on the big screen again and I was amazed that most of us <br/>\nremembered ALL the songs. The words were superimposed on the bottom of the <br/>\nscreen, too, if you needed a little help. And yes, there were lots of folks <br/>\nin costumes which just added to the fun of the whole experience. I highly <br/>\nrecommend doing this if you are able!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62088,"nextTopicId":61701}}
