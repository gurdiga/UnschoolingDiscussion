In their materials, they claim that the average American<br/>\ngets food poisoning twice a year, usually from their own cooking or food<br/>\nmade by friends or family. In response to their findings, they have a<br/>\nprogram funded and running now for educating anyone who is interested about<br/>\nlearning to handle and prepare foods safely.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou would want to contact your local county cooperative extension office<br/>\nabout the program. The class, which I expect is nearly identical throughout<br/>\nthe US, takes about 2-3 hours and you learn all the ins and outs of<br/>\nbacteria, food preservation and more. Well worth taking, especially if<br/>\nyou&#39;ve a child, or you yourself, selling foods to others. And since the<br/>\ncounty decides on its rules for safe food sales, any questions you had on<br/>\nthe matter could be easily addressed during the class. It was free here and<br/>\nwould probably be a free program, or just a few dollars, every where.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100637,"nextTopicId":100641}}
