It was easy for me to<br/>\nfall into the fake natural consequence crap, not so<br/>\neasy to do anymore *BWG*<br/>\nThe cushions suggestion is a really good one.<br/>\nDefinitely something I can do, as well as the reminder<br/>\nto be a calm presence as opposed to an anxious one.<br/>\n(Thank you Deb and Su)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Maybe you could tell them next time that you&#39;re being<br/>\nsupremely <br/>\nselfish, <br/>\nbecause you want to have kids who will love you for<br/>\nlife and do things <br/>\nfor your <br/>\ngrandchildren and be generous with you and others,<br/>\nrather than kids who <br/>\nlearn to <br/>\nleave home at 18 and hardly look back. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLOVE that :) SO fantastic :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again everyone :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!
