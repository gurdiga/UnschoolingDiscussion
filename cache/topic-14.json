Especially looking at her unstable<br/>\nbackground and possible abuse issues, I think she will need a lot of<br/>\nhealing and settling in time.  Time for her to know that we love her, and<br/>\nare not going to send her back or reject her, no matter what may be in her<br/>\npast.  Time for her to come to terms with her past, and I am almost certain<br/>\nthat she will need counseling.  Unless she turns out to be much more well<br/>\nadjusted than we expect.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of our homestudy questions is &quot;What experiences or characteristics do<br/>\nyou think will enable you to care for a hard to place child?&quot;  I&#39;m not sure<br/>\nwhat to tell them, except that we will be patient and will love her<br/>\nunconditionally.  We will seek couseling for her if she needs it, and do<br/>\nanything else we can to help her.....What else IS there?<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing feels quite like opening yourself, your family and your parenting<br/>\nup to the scrutiny and judgement of the homestudy processed, to see if you<br/>\nwill be &quot;approved.&quot;  How many people can do that with no trepidation?<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20,"nextTopicId":39}}
