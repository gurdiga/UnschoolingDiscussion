You are much<br/>\n&gt; more likely to get help when you need it if you are known as someone who<br/>\n&gt; offers help to others.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *** Put out all the negative energy you want, doesn&#39;t affect <br/>\n&gt; life... ***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Harming others affects their lives.  And it affects the life of the<br/>\n&gt; person who did the hurting.  If it was criminal he goes to jail.  It it<br/>\n&gt; was just nasty others will know him for his actions and won&#39;t be as<br/>\n&gt; willing to offer their friendship, help, or courtesy to him. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not even a reward or punishment you have to wait until you&#39;re dead<br/>\n&gt; for.
