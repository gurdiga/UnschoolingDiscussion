They had been<br/>\ninvited to give a presentation on their ideas on education by the organizers<br/>\nof a conference to be held in Victoria on the Rights of Children.<br/>\nInterestingly, we were the only group to address the issue of education and<br/>\nchildren&#39;s rights. We chose the word &#39;learner&#39; because it can be associated<br/>\nwith lifelong learning and avoided already &#39;age&#39; loaded terms like child and<br/>\nadult. We also avoided the word student as this role is closely associated<br/>\nwith schooling and teachers. We wrote 12 points that covered both rights and<br/>\nresponsibilities, asserting that you can&#39;t have one without the other. The<br/>\nunderlying assumption is based on the fact that virtually everyone in<br/>\ncultures all around the world trust 2 year olds to learn how to talk without<br/>\nbeing taught. Psychologists say that learning how to talk is probably one of<br/>\nthe most difficult learning tasks of a lifetime, yet each very small child<br/>\nmasters the complexity of language on their own initiative. A meaningful,<br/>\nresponsive and supportive relationship optimizes the languaging and<br/>\ncommunication process. However, we do not trust children to learn to read or<br/>\ndo math on their own, we have developed a &quot;schooled&quot; attitude that if we<br/>\ndon&#39;t make children learn that they will not develop these skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis assumption is what our Declaration challenges. We assert that learners,<br/>\nregardless of age have the right to determine the direction and course of<br/>\ntheir own learning. We assert that if a two year old can learn a language<br/>\nwithout being taught then we need to re-think our entire production model of<br/>\npublic education. We propose that any new model for learning be based on the<br/>\nunderlying idea that human beings are biological and that a development and<br/>\ngrowth metaphor would be the most appropriate model to support the lifelong<br/>\nlearning of every individual.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe heart of the learning process is a mutually chosen and sustained learner<br/>\nand mentor relationship where there is a shared enthusiasm and fascination<br/>\nfor learning in a particular field. The freedom to choose and design the<br/>\nnature of this learning relationship is central to the Declaration of<br/>\nLearner&#39;s Rights and Responsibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Declaration was announced in all of our four workshops and was given out<br/>\nto the participants at the conference in June. That same week we also gave a<br/>\ncopy to the Minister of Education in Victoria. We intend to represent the<br/>\nDeclaration to the Minister each year on the anniversary until children have<br/>\na choice and a voice in the educational process. We intend to bring an<br/>\nawareness to the issue of &quot;ageism.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeclaration of Learner&#39;s Rights and Responsibilities<br/>\n<br/>\n1. As a learner I have the right to allow my own experience and enthusiasm<br/>\nto guide my learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.

The Learning Process<br/>\n<br/>\n1.1. Every human is born with an inherent ability to learn. Learning is<br/>\nintegral to living. It is the awareness of change and development.<br/>\n1.2. Learning is a lifelong natural process. Learning increases one&#39;s<br/>\nability and choices in responding to, and being responsible for one&#39;s<br/>\nactions and thoughts.<br/>\n1.3. Learning emerges from an integral enthusiasm to understand and has<br/>\ninherent worth. Learning is a desire to know, and characteristically has its<br/>\nown intrinsic reward.<br/>\n1.4. Learning implies growth, and growth implies the realization of an inner<br/>\npattern of design and harmony. Balance in growth is achieved by maintaining<br/>\na harmony between one&#39;s conscious development and the underlying unconscious<br/>\nawareness.<br/>\n1.5. Learning is a mirroring process. If an individual is respected then one<br/>\nwill learn respect. It is a human need to create meaning and to be in a<br/>\nresponsive loving relationship.<br/>\n1.6. It is essential to shift focus from teaching and expectations to<br/>\nlearning and curiousity. Meeting the needs of the individual is the best way<br/>\nto invest in society, as fulfilled individuals will make positive<br/>\ncontributions to society.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The Learning Individual<br/>\n<br/>\n2.1. Learning is based on experience. Patterns of experience form models for<br/>\nunderstanding one&#39;s role in the world. One naturally learns through<br/>\nmodeling. Learning emerges from an inner desire and enthusiasm to understand<br/>\nand to form meaningful relationships in the world.<br/>\n2.2. Every individual has the right to determine the direction of one&#39;s own<br/>\nlearning, and correspondingly is responsible for one&#39;s learning.<br/>\n2.3. Every learner has the right to be treated as a whole and competent<br/>\nlearner. The responsibilities for the results are each learner&#39;s opportunity<br/>\nfor growth.<br/>\n2.4. Natural learning is the unfolding of the infinite potential within.<br/>\nSelf-realization is a process of understanding one&#39;s potential as one&#39;s role<br/>\nin a dynamic between self and others.<br/>\n2.5. Learning is ultimately a self-design process, therefore each individual<br/>\nhas the right to follow their own inner wisdom.<br/>\n2.6. It is the right of every learner to be held in respect and it is the<br/>\nresponsibility of each learner to hold everyone else in respect.<br/>\n2.7. It is the right of every individual to live and learn from a sense of<br/>\nfulfillment, and to set goals that increase one&#39;s sense of self-confidence<br/>\nand one&#39;s sense of oneself as a resourceful individual.<br/>\n2.8. One&#39;s self is ultimately not exclusive of others, it is inclusive of<br/>\nothers through a sense of love and compassion. The purpose of living from<br/>\none&#39;s sense of fulfillment is that one&#39;s actions will naturally enhance the<br/>\nexperience of others and maintain a balance in relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3. The Learning Relationship<br/>\n<br/>\na.) the family - parents<br/>\na3.1. The parenting relationship is the first and most significant<br/>\nrelationship. Each learning parent is responsible to respond to the learning<br/>\nneeds of the child as expressed by the child. Every child has the right to a<br/>\nnurturing and responsive family.<br/>\na3.2. One&#39;s capacity or ability to learn is determined more by the quality<br/>\nof one&#39;s relationships than any other factor. Given a meaningful and<br/>\nresponsive relationship, every child makes appropriate choices for their<br/>\nlevel of ability.<br/>\na3.3. All families have the right to equal access to funding available for<br/>\nlearning within a society. It is the family&#39;s right to decide how to best<br/>\ninvest this funding for the lifelong development of learners.<br/>\na3.4. Life is a challenge, living is maintaining a delicate balance.<br/>\nChildren naturally model parents, and integrate their strategies. It is<br/>\ntherefore essential that parents are supported in taking responsibility for<br/>\nbecoming optimum models for learners.<br/>\n<br/>\nb.) the mentor<br/>\nb3.1. A collaborative learning relationship is designed around a mutual<br/>\nenthusiasm for learning. The roles of mentor and learner shift and it is the<br/>\nresponsibility of a mentor to share strategies and insights with the<br/>\nlearner. The learner-mentor relationship is based on the principles of<br/>\nfriendship and mutual respect.<br/>\nb3.2. Every individual has the right to choose to participate in a<br/>\nrelationship that is essentially nurturing and caring. Conversely, in<br/>\nachieving one&#39;s needs, one must be responsible to the realization of<br/>\nanother&#39;s needs.<br/>\nb3.3. Each individual in a relationship has the right to choose to enter<br/>\ninto a relationship that is based on mutual gain. It is the right of an<br/>\nindividual to end a relationship.<br/>\nb3.4. Learning is a self-evaluative process. Learning is a collaborative<br/>\nprocess as it is important to include other points of view for an increase<br/>\nin self understanding. It is the responsibility of each learner to invite<br/>\nthe point of view of others to gather information for further<br/>\nself-evaluation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n4. The Learning Organization<br/>\n<br/>\n4.1. It is the responsibility of every learning organization to remain open<br/>\nto redesign, to include everyone in a process of consensus evaluation for<br/>\nongoing openness and change.<br/>\n4.2. Each individual has equal access to the resources of the community to<br/>\nincrease their learning through development. Each individual is responsible<br/>\nto reciprocate the investment by the organization.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n5. The Learning Society<br/>\n<br/>\n5.1. It is the responsibility of a society to provide equal access to<br/>\nresources and to invest in the spiritual, intellectual, emotional, and<br/>\nphysical growth of learners. It is the right of every individual to develop<br/>\nto one&#39;s full potential and one&#39;s responsibility to share what one gains.<br/>\n5.2. It is the responsibility of society to encourage diverse points of<br/>\nview, and it is the responsibility of individuals in society to respect<br/>\nother view points. A society has the responsibility to withdraw support for<br/>\nview points that are against individuals or groups.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ncreated by the collaboration of · Jesse Blum · Ilana Cameron · Greg Dean ·<br/>\nDavid Muncaster · Sarah Partridge · Serena Staples · and Brent Cameron<br/>\n(mentor) · with editorial input from friends<br/>\n<br/>\n© 1994 All Rights Reserved<br/>\nWondertree Foundation for Natural Learning<br/>\nBox 38083 Vancouver, B.C.
