Stripping a child&#39;s home of televisions <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t help the child because the rest of the world has televisions.  <br/>\nTeaching the child to recognize that they have a problem and then giving <br/>\nthem tools to work with helps.  Some things have to be limited or controlled <br/>\nby the parent until such time as the child is able to recognize the triggers <br/>\nand how to use the &quot;tools&quot; to control their &quot;addictions&quot; or compulsions <br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn rare cases the answer is the same as with an alcoholic, complete <br/>\nabstinance.  However, many alcoholics learn to live with alchol either in <br/>\ntheir homes or in the perivery of their lives and learn to not use it <br/>\nthemselves.  They also learn to use &quot;tools&quot; to continue to abstain.  <br/>\nFortunately in lots of non-substance addictions, learning to use &quot;tools&quot; <br/>\nmakes life much easier and definable as being within the parameters known as <br/>\n&quot;the norm.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTery<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 21<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sun, 09 Sep 2001 14:22:20 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: Diane &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cen46624@...\">cen46624@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Addictive Personality Disorder<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If I were seriously concerned that a person in my family were actually <br/>\n&gt;addicted<br/>\n&gt;to something, I don&#39;t think I could in good faith have it in the home, even <br/>\n&gt;if<br/>\n&gt;other family members like it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How could I allow this person to see everyone else in the family enjoying <br/>\n&gt;it,<br/>\n&gt;and not want it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does this sound cruel to anyone else?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Not attacking, just confused.
