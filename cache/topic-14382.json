For someone who is new to this, you sure have a<br/>\ngood definition of what unschooling is.<br/>\nKErry<br/>\n--- Carolyn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nielsonc@...\">nielsonc@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; dawn wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean no formal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; classes, it means the child decides whether or<br/>\n&gt; not to do them.(IMO)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m very new at this, having just pulled my 10 year<br/>\n&gt; old daughter out of<br/>\n&gt; public school a little over a month ago now.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; telling myself, she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; depressurizing and I&#39;m going to allow her time to do<br/>\n&gt; that without<br/>\n&gt; pressure to do something &quot;constructive&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve talked a lot about what she&#39;s interested in<br/>\n&gt; and what she&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; interested in and it&#39;s becoming clear to me that she<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt; know.  So I have found myself trying to put<br/>\n&gt; interesting things within<br/>\n&gt; her reach and let her pick them up or not.  For<br/>\n&gt; example, she declared<br/>\n&gt; herself not interested in history or colonial<br/>\n&gt; America.  I rented Roots<br/>\n&gt; at the local library and invited her to watch.  Last<br/>\n&gt; night we finished<br/>\n&gt; watching the last of the six videotapes.  During<br/>\n&gt; movie time, it was her<br/>\n&gt; idea to tell her friends on the telephone that she<br/>\n&gt; was busy watching<br/>\n&gt; Roots and couldn&#39;t talk.  We all enjoyedd it<br/>\n&gt; thoroughly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I feel like I&#39;m cheating but how can she know if<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s interested in<br/>\n&gt; history or not when her exposure to the subject is<br/>\n&gt; limited to what they<br/>\n&gt; presented in public school?   It seems to me like my<br/>\n&gt; job is to offer<br/>\n&gt; lots of interesting activities and see which ones<br/>\n&gt; she wants to delve<br/>\n&gt; into.  I&#39;d prefer it, I think, if she had some grand<br/>\n&gt; passion for<br/>\n&gt; something and I&#39;d help her pursue it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Carolyn<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14380,"nextTopicId":14365}}
