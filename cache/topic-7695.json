Tonight, I was reading my e-news. In the<br/>\nentertainment section, there was a focus on the song &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot; by the<br/>\nDixie Chicks (Country). It stated that 20 out of 149 radio stations chose<br/>\nNOT to play this song because a battered woman plots and kills her abusive<br/>\nhusband in it. I wrote a letter to Lon Helton (of Country Countdown USA)<br/>\nregarding that particular song. I am open to any and all comments PRIVATELY.<br/>\nThe letter is below. I would like to know what your thought are. thanks.<br/>\nStephanie<br/>\nMr. Lon Helton<br/>\nCountry Countdown USA<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Helton,<br/>\nI am writing this in regard to the single &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot; from the Dixie<br/>\nChicks. As a survivor of DV (domestic violence) I can personally relate to<br/>\nthe feelings that drove Wanda and Mary Anne to poison the black eyed peas.<br/>\nDomestic violence is much bigger today than is heard of, and unfortunately<br/>\nis not getting the attention it so badly needs. DV has many forms: physical,<br/>\npsychological, and emotional; and it is extremely hard for a battered person<br/>\nto find their way out. I cannot understand why radio stations have decided<br/>\nnot to play &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot;, but they will play Martina  McBride&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;Independence Day&quot;. Both songs depict the end of a violent relationship. The<br/>\ndiscussion of women plotting their abuser&#39;s death is not new, but the<br/>\nmajority of women do not make it that far. They end up in Intensive Care or<br/>\ndie. Many women may think of &quot;getting back&quot; at their abuser, only to<br/>\nimmediately dismiss the thought, since if caught thinking such a thought<br/>\ncould (and would) provoke another beating.<br/>\n    Domestic violence needs to be put into the media, and if this is a way<br/>\nto get DV noticed, then I am all for it! Please feel free to contact me for<br/>\nany questions or comments that you may have- I am more than willing to<br/>\nshare. Sincerely Mrs Stephanie A Coomer (now married to a non abuser!)<br/>\n<br/>\nRon and Stephanie<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nGet Paid to Surf the Web.
