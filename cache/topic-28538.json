This discussion has been about kid&#39;s not understanding<br/>\nwhen their driving their parents nuts.  Then having to take the blame for<br/>\ngetting yelled at or worse.  <br/>\nWhy would an unschooling kid not expect to be able to come to a parent<br/>\nfor any reason?   Older kids surely understand &quot; I have some work to do &quot;<br/>\nso we&#39;re primarily talking about younger kids here.  Why wouldn&#39;t they be<br/>\nable to come to a parent?  <br/>\nWhy wouldn&#39;t an unschooling parent understand that forgetting the punch<br/>\nline to a joke is an emergency?  Or not being able to find that lego? <br/>\nWhy would an unschooling parent be expecting a child to hold in her<br/>\nfrustration at not being able to get help,  but then not be able to<br/>\ncontain theirs, if they get pestered?  Just who is  the adult in this<br/>\nsituation?<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28533,"nextTopicId":28415}}
