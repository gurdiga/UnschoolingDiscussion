The school took no time in proving that Chris was ADHD... ... Because I am bipolar I see all these symptoms and think that maybe Chris is. ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-280020384\">Hi Michele!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I knew he had dyslexia and the<br/>\n&gt;school waited until 5th grade to do something about it even though I am<br/>\n&gt;a fierce advocate for my son. By then they wanted him tested up the<br/>\n&gt;wazoo to &quot;prove it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The school took no time in &quot;proving&quot; that Chris was ADHD...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;He was so damaged by frustration and trauma from<br/>\n&gt;public school humiliation, etc. and being molested there that - in my<br/>\n&gt;opinion - the stress triggered something like the label bipolar.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because I am bipolar I see all these symptoms and think that maybe Chris is.<br/>\nBut listening to you, I am wondering if I am right. Maybe ha is just<br/>\nreacting to all the stress that he is under. He is so normal at home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;He is 90% calmer in the summer when he is not in school.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Same here. The difference between home and school is night and day, no<br/>\nmatter if its summer or just a three day week end.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;The school said &quot;we have no money, no space,<br/>\n&gt;no time, no tutors, etc.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They tell me that they do not have the resources to deal with Chris&#39;<br/>\nbehavior so they want to warehouse him with other kids who they can&#39;t or<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to deal with. And then they talk about how I am stunting his<br/>\nsocialization by taking him out of school. Their reasources are so lacking<br/>\nbut they have taken the time to call me three seperate times and try to talk<br/>\nme out of homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;Thankfully &quot;they&quot; gave me<br/>\n&gt;&quot;permission.&quot; I am angry, hurt, wounded, etc. over all of this. They are<br/>\n&gt;MY kids not the school&#39;s. Now that we are &quot;out&quot; we can begin the healing<br/>\n&gt;process:) Michele<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t know how it galls me (actually you probably do know) that I have<br/>\nto wait on permission to do what I know is best for my child. I don&#39;t worry<br/>\nabout jail. I worry that they will take him from me. That&#39;s the nightmare<br/>\nthat keeps me up at night. And when I finally get him out of school I swear<br/>\nI am going to find a state where DSS is not called out abitrarily on people<br/>\nand homeschooling is not a dirty word and that is where I am going to move.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK... jumping down off the soap box. WAIT! I&#39;ll stay up here. This climbing<br/>\nup and down is making my bad knee hurt&lt;GGG&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrightest Blessings,<br/>\n             Virginia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.386 / Virus Database: 218 - Release Date: 9/9/2002</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44282,"nextTopicId":44242}}
