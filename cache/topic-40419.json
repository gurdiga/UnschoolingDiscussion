How&#39;s the unschooling life going?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s some of what we did yesterday.  I read The Story of Ping to my 4.5 yr <br/>\nold dd and my 10 yr ds listened too.   Then the AC repair men came.  I opened <br/>\na drawer in the bathroom and saw a tiny gecko!  Amazing!  I calmly told the <br/>\nkids to come see &lt;g&gt; (I&#39;m so proud of myself for not screaming, I guess it&#39;s <br/>\nbugs that I really don&#39;t like).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 13 yr ds caught it in a bug jar and we started looking in reptile books <br/>\nand google.com to see what kind it was.  It was so cute - pinkish/peach and <br/>\nabout 1.5 inches long.  You could see some organs thru its pale skin.  And <br/>\nit&#39;s suction-cup feet stuck to the cover of the jar.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the AC guys overheard us and told us his hobby was reptiles and he <br/>\nused to do presentations at schools.  So he told us about the gecko being a <br/>\ncommon household kind and that it could get to be 4 inches long (that&#39;s what <br/>\ngoogle said too).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen we let it go after my 10 yr ds took some pictures of it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth boys played Nintendo and my oldest read some of CS Lewis&#39; Chronicles of <br/>\nNarnia.  He likes these books and Redwall and the Left Behind adult and kid <br/>\nseries.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd wanted to cut her jeans to shorts and then she and her brother decided <br/>\nto make puppets with the remnants.  So glueing, cutting, sewing etc.  Then we <br/>\nneeded to make a puppet stage.  So more cutting, taping, coloring, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI read 3 books to my dd: Blueberries For Sal (I love that one), If You Give a <br/>\nMoose a Muffin, and If You Give a Pig a Pancake.  And we played dress-up with <br/>\nscarves and danced around.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater I played chinese checkers with my 10 yr old and later with my dd.  My <br/>\ndd makes up all her own rules so one piece can jump across the whole board if <br/>\nyou want.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they all watched Cyberchase.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a fun day!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n«·.,¸¸,.·´¯`·.,¸¸,.·´¯`·.»§«(¨`v´¨).»§«·.,¸¸,.·´¯`·.,¸¸,.·´¯`·.»<br/>\n                                 ` v´<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of <br/>\ninstruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiousity of inquiry; <br/>\nfor this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need <br/>\nof freedom.&quot;<br/>\n-- Albert Einstein <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40437,"nextTopicId":40453}}
