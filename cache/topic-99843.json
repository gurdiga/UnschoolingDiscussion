(The other is<br/>\nunschooling and activism.)  Here&#39;s the description from the website:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe role of technology/media in unschooling: This has become a hot-<br/>\nbutton issue in the home education community. We&#39;re looking for<br/>\narticles that are non-reactionary. Just let us know about your<br/>\nfamily. Are you comfortable with the use of technology in your home?<br/>\nWhy or why not? What are the benefits and drawbacks? Has your home<br/>\nundergone a change in the use of technology? What were the results?<br/>\nWhether it&#39;s TV or computers or video games, it seems everyone has<br/>\nan opinion, and everyone has a story.
