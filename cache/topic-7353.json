For example some of the parents I know whose children are<br/>\nschooled, see that their parenting only regards those areas deemed<br/>\nnon-educational! Whereas my parenting encompasses all that and a lot more!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I learn to have yet more trust in my children (and see the unschooling<br/>\nprocess succeeding so well as regards their &quot;education&quot; ) I find that his<br/>\ntrust is spilling over into more and more areas such as choosing their own<br/>\nclothes, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet other areas I find that I do make a final decision having tried to<br/>\nseparate my knee-jerk responses from my actual beliefs! Not always easy!!<br/>\nFor example, I was raised by a mother who insisted on three square meals a<br/>\nday at very set times. Yet I am finding that although we all eat breakfast<br/>\ntogether, lunch tends to not really happen! The kids kind of graze during<br/>\nthe day and help themselves as they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven the baby (2yog) knows that she can help herself to the food on the<br/>\nbottom shelf of the fridge whenever she wants it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy automatic response was to stop this and insist that they &quot;sat up to the<br/>\ntable and eat a PROPER meal&quot; yet once I really thought about it, there is NO<br/>\nreason (in our family) for this to happen so I have let it continue and now<br/>\nI find that the kids are making good choices ie. they will decide whether or<br/>\nnot they have had &quot;enough healthy food&quot; for the day and therefore can have<br/>\nsome &quot;unhealthy food&quot; or not!<br/>\n<br/>\nYours, still confused but learning all the time!!<br/>\nBrooke<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nBrooke</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Nanci and Thomas Kuykendall","from":"&quot;Nanci and Thomas Kuykendall&quot; &lt;tn-k4of5@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"4sMEfXH7ZpKPqERbkn6NTUyEFckrap7g_fpFoykbKHcIo65REoteaFKOEflAm7kd_KHOY1xGxzVIvVtH2HxO-OGfDoKSGFB55MyEnEHeXjetHnMMEjcg5ocar6ytwQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[Unschooling-dotcom] TV monitoring","postDate":"954274494","msgId":7383,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwMzI4MjAxNC5NQUEwNjEzOUBtYWlsNi5iaWdtYWlsYm94LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":7353,"nextInTopic":7388,"prevInTime":7382,"nextInTime":7384,"topicId":7353,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You would no more allow your child to eat nothing but candy for breakfast lunch and dinner than you should allow your child to drown themselves in tv.  Most tv is brain candy, and too much candy makes you sick.  I think this falls under the realm of parenting and discipline, not home/unschooling.  These matters must be decided based on a child&#39;s personality and disposition and there is no standard way to address it.
