It sounds so simple, but many moms get busy and they don&#39;t take<br/>\nthe time to really be there with their children to help them work things<br/>\nout.  Moms get busy with cleaning the house or making dinner or whatever.<br/>\nTake time out of your day to *be with your boys for how ever long it takes<br/>\nto help them through this frustrating time.  Be there to not only help<br/>\ndiffuse the situation, but to prevent it from happening to begin with.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen something happens where one son can&#39;t express himself very well or does<br/>\nsomething to the other, help him to say what he wants.  Help them both to<br/>\ncommunicate without hurling insults at each other.  It&#39;s frustrating and a<br/>\nlot of work, but it&#39;s such a great life skill to give them.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHelp them to not make it personal.  If one took a toy, he could say, &quot;I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t done with that.  Would you please give it back.&quot; (instead of &quot;you<br/>\nmoron, I was playing with that.  Give it back.) If one boy banged into the<br/>\nother and the one who was banged was offended, it isn&#39;t going to help if he<br/>\nyells at the one who banged him.  You could help him to say, &quot;I don&#39;t like<br/>\nit when you bang into me.  Please be more careful.&quot;  Model saying sorry when<br/>\nit applies to you.  Suggest that a sorry might make the other person feel a<br/>\nlittle better when someone&#39;s been offended or hurt.  (I wouldn&#39;t force it<br/>\nthough.)  And help them to see things from the other&#39;s perspective.  (you<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t like it if you were playing with that and he came and took it from<br/>\nyou with no warning, would you?&quot;)  But not too much preaching.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are there for a good part of their interactions you can see where the<br/>\nproblem lies in their communication.  Maybe the older one is frustrated<br/>\nbecause they younger one is doing something you can&#39;t see that isn&#39;t very<br/>\nnice.  Maybe he is just in a growth stage and he needs your help to express<br/>\nhimself for now.  It can be frustrating but it&#39;s worth it.  When you see<br/>\nthem working out a deal or working through a problem later on in a mature<br/>\nand thoughtful way, it&#39;ll be so worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"7"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] where&#39;s the harmony?","postDate":"1111838942","msgId":104919,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDNzAwMTNCQzE4RTU0Qy0xQjQtMzlFNEVAbWJsay1yMjUuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGQyMm5iOStydnVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGQyMm5iOStydnVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":104921,"prevInTime":104918,"nextInTime":104920,"topicId":104911,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
