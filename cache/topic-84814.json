The babies are still little enough that it doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re in there at the same time as either of us. <br/>\n <br/>\nIn a nutshell, I hate it. We have to put a fan in the window just to cook because the heat in the galley kitchen can be incredible! But there is NOTHING else available for year-round rent on Cape Cod. People up here don&#39;t tend to have so many children and don&#39;t need four or five bedroom houses. We even qualify income-wise for section 8, which has a four bedroom available, but they say that there isn&#39;t enough of an age difference between the kids for that fourth bedroom! ?!! Go figure!  <br/>\n <br/>\nOnly another 18 months left to go.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe do have a basement, but it&#39;s not liveable space.<br/>\n <br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\nRen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;6 people..600sq. feet..and only ONE bathroom!<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWow, wow, wow!!!
