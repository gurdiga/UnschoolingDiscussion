I am sure you<br/>\nare receiving numerous letters opposing the<br/>\nideas of Mr. Danehy; so what&#39;s one more?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very sorry for Mr. Danehy.  His life must be extremely closed off<br/>\nfrom &quot;real&quot; (and very interesting) people and<br/>\nhis mind just a miniature, darkened forest of slow synaptic action.<br/>\nAnyone, who in his apparent sincerety, believes<br/>\nthat all homeschoolers educate the same and for the same reasons is,<br/>\n&lt;grin, tongue in cheek&gt;, grossly uneducated in<br/>\nthis particular subject.   However, the real problem I see is that he<br/>\nhas the temerity to produce such quibble on a<br/>\nworld-wide forum so that his ignorance is not only on display to the<br/>\ninhabitants of Tucson,  but now, just envision<br/>\nthe multitude of people who have seen what type of person  (possibly the<br/>\nTuscon) public school system has<br/>\nproduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to give you a little education, Mr. Danehy.  I have been<br/>\nhome educating my sons since I was pregnant<br/>\nwith the first one.  My oldest is 9 and the younger son is 5.  My<br/>\nhusband and I both believe that there can be more<br/>\nto education that what traditional schools are able to offer.  When a<br/>\nchild is in a classroom for most of the day, they<br/>\ncome home, are required to continue their education at the kitchen table<br/>\nand then get ready for another day, just<br/>\nlike all the other ones; and thus, there is really no time left for<br/>\nadditional activities that the school is unable or<br/>\nunwilling to provide.  Surely you could not argue that the influence of<br/>\nthe other students and the teacher would<br/>\noutweigh the fundamental ideas of the child&#39;s parents.  This you might<br/>\nbe saying is good.  Well it isn&#39;t.  I will assume<br/>\nalso that you do not have children or do not have the luxury of &quot;really<br/>\nknowing&quot; how and what your child thinks<br/>\nand feels.  Most home educators are open minded and alert to the needs<br/>\nand desires of their children.  We do not,<br/>\ngenerally, want our children to have any predudices towards others.  As<br/>\na matter of fact, my boys do not yet, and<br/>\nhopefully will not ever, have first hand knowledge of anyone being made<br/>\nto feel inadequate because of their race or<br/>\ntheir religion or their disability.   They are exposed, on a daily<br/>\nbasis, to many different life styles.  At  this point in<br/>\ntheir lives, a difference is only a difference; it is in their minds a<br/>\nnatural co-existance.    They are not educated at<br/>\nhome in order to instill far right wing (or left wing) ideas.  We are<br/>\nnot &quot;religious wackos&quot; with an anti-government<br/>\nagenda to fulfill.  I own my business( Plum Creek RV Resort ) and am not<br/>\na die-hard developer but not an extreme<br/>\nenvironmentalist.  I have succeeded as an entrepreneur in my name<br/>\nwithout assistance from anyone, except for<br/>\nthe people who I employ.  My husband has done the same.  And our<br/>\nchildren are raised to believe in the &quot;American<br/>\nDream&quot; and that with hard work, it will come true.   I believe in<br/>\nfree-speech, free-will, and hopes for a  life of<br/>\nhappiness.  I am a christian who takes my children to Sunday School, but<br/>\nthat is not the basis for home educating.<br/>\nWhen, what I call concentrated schooling, only takes up 3-4 hours each<br/>\nday, the doors are opened to other, equally<br/>\neducational opportunities.  My sons both participate in theatre class<br/>\nwith 2 productions each year (all of the cast<br/>\nmembers are also home educated).  The oldest plays two instruments,<br/>\npiano and guitar, both of which he performs<br/>\npublically.  He is able to take lessons during the day from musicians<br/>\n(two of them go out on  world tours).  These<br/>\nactivities would be greatly hindered should he be stuffed away in a<br/>\nschool all day, every day.  The youngest son is<br/>\nlearning to play the violin but due to the difference in interests (one<br/>\nthat I might be unaware of if I weren&#39;t his<br/>\nteacher), we will focus on fine arts and allow him lessons with an<br/>\nartist when he is ready.  They have quality<br/>\neducational materials.  Some are purchased curriculums (just like the<br/>\npublic system school uses, by the way) and<br/>\nsome of the academics just come from our own imagination that we build<br/>\non, which requires some research from<br/>\nthe child and the parent.   I am qualified as a teacher because I am<br/>\ntheir mother.  Noone wants a quality of life for<br/>\nmy sons as much as me.  I would not, in anyway destroy their mind or<br/>\ntheir opportunity to succeed in their goals,<br/>\nall of which require an education to obtain.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children can keep up with any child and surpass many, both<br/>\nacademically and socially.  Our schools, by the way,<br/>\nmay need a little of the fabric torn away.  Why, if the schools are in<br/>\nsuch good shape, are so many people arguing the<br/>\nthe entire educational system in America needs serious attention.  Why<br/>\nare there so many drop-outs?  Why are<br/>\nSAT scores in low income neighborhoods so much lower than in white<br/>\ncollar neighborhoods?  Why, if the system is<br/>\nas good as you purport, are so many parents enraged by what their<br/>\nchildren are learning.  Why is there school<br/>\nviolence?  Think about these things when you open your mouth in public<br/>\nor put your pen to the paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy Griffin<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote for you for the day,  &quot;Better to be silent and thought a fool,<br/>\nthan to speak and remove all doubt&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Biggers:<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease forward this letter on to Mr. Tom Danehy who is not listed as<br/>\npart of your staff, nor does he have listed an<br/>\nemail address link from your page.  Might this lack of information be<br/>\ndue to his intolerance to email which would in<br/>\nall probably, contradict his articles?<br/>\n<br/>\nI read the above referrenced article via the internet.  I am sure you<br/>\nare receiving numerous letters opposing the<br/>\nideas of Mr. Danehy; so what&#39;s one more?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very sorry for Mr. Danehy.  His life must be extremely closed off<br/>\nfrom &quot;real&quot; (and very interesting) people and<br/>\nhis mind just a miniature, darkened forest of slow synaptic action.<br/>\nAnyone, who in his apparent sincerety, believes<br/>\nthat all homeschoolers educate the same and for the same reasons is,<br/>\n&lt;grin, tongue in cheek&gt;, grossly uneducated in<br/>\nthis particular subject.   However, the real problem I see is that he<br/>\nhas the temerity to produce such quibble on a<br/>\nworld-wide forum so that his ignorance is not only on display to the<br/>\ninhabitants of Tucson,  but now, just envision<br/>\nthe multitude of people who have seen what type of person  (possibly the<br/>\nTuscon) public school system has<br/>\nproduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to give you a little education, Mr. Danehy.  I have been<br/>\nhome educating my sons since I was pregnant<br/>\nwith the first one.  My oldest is 9 and the younger son is 5.  My<br/>\nhusband and I both believe that there can be more<br/>\nto education that what traditional schools are able to offer.  When a<br/>\nchild is in a classroom for most of the day, they<br/>\ncome home, are required to continue their education at the kitchen table<br/>\nand then get ready for another day, just<br/>\nlike all the other ones; and thus, there is really no time left for<br/>\nadditional activities that the school is unable or<br/>\nunwilling to provide.  Surely you could not argue that the influence of<br/>\nthe other students and the teacher would<br/>\noutweigh the fundamental ideas of the child&#39;s parents.  This you might<br/>\nbe saying is good.  Well it isn&#39;t.  I will assume<br/>\nalso that you do not have children or do not have the luxury of &quot;really<br/>\nknowing&quot; how and what your child thinks<br/>\nand feels.  Most home educators are open minded and alert to the needs<br/>\nand desires of their children.  We do not,<br/>\ngenerally, want our children to have any predudices towards others.  As<br/>\na matter of fact, my boys do not yet, and<br/>\nhopefully will not ever, have first hand knowledge of anyone being made<br/>\nto feel inadequate because of their race or<br/>\ntheir religion or their disability.   They are exposed, on a daily<br/>\nbasis, to many different life styles.  At  this point in<br/>\ntheir lives, a difference is only a difference; it is in their minds a<br/>\nnatural co-existance.    They are not educated at<br/>\nhome in order to instill far right wing (or left wing) ideas.  We are<br/>\nnot &quot;religious wackos&quot; with an anti-government<br/>\nagenda to fulfill.  I own my business( Plum Creek RV Resort ) and am not<br/>\na die-hard developer but not an extreme<br/>\nenvironmentalist.  I have succeeded as an entrepreneur in my name<br/>\nwithout assistance from anyone, except for<br/>\nthe people who I employ.  My husband has done the same.  And our<br/>\nchildren are raised to believe in the &quot;American<br/>\nDream&quot; and that with hard work, it will come true.   I believe in<br/>\nfree-speech, free-will, and hopes for a  life of<br/>\nhappiness.  I am a christian who takes my children to Sunday School, but<br/>\nthat is not the basis for home educating.<br/>\nWhen, what I call concentrated schooling, only takes up 3-4 hours each<br/>\nday, the doors are opened to other, equally<br/>\neducational opportunities.  My sons both participate in theatre class<br/>\nwith 2 productions each year (all of the cast<br/>\nmembers are also home educated).  The oldest plays two instruments,<br/>\npiano and guitar, both of which he performs<br/>\npublically.  He is able to take lessons during the day from musicians<br/>\n(two of them go out on  world tours).  These<br/>\nactivities would be greatly hindered should he be stuffed away in a<br/>\nschool all day, every day.  The youngest son is<br/>\nlearning to play the violin but due to the difference in interests (one<br/>\nthat I might be unaware of if I weren&#39;t his<br/>\nteacher), we will focus on fine arts and allow him lessons with an<br/>\nartist when he is ready.  They have quality<br/>\neducational materials.  Some are purchased curriculums (just like the<br/>\npublic system school uses, by the way) and<br/>\nsome of the academics just come from our own imagination that we build<br/>\non, which requires some research from<br/>\nthe child and the parent.   I am qualified as a teacher because I am<br/>\ntheir mother.  Noone wants a quality of life for<br/>\nmy sons as much as me.  I would not, in anyway destroy their mind or<br/>\ntheir opportunity to succeed in their goals,<br/>\nall of which require an education to obtain.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children can keep up with any child and surpass many, both<br/>\nacademically and socially.  Our schools, by the way,<br/>\nmay need a little of the fabric torn away.  Why, if the schools are in<br/>\nsuch good shape, are so many people arguing the<br/>\nthe entire educational system in America needs serious attention.  Why<br/>\nare there so many drop-outs?  Why are<br/>\nSAT scores in low income neighborhoods so much lower than in white<br/>\ncollar neighborhoods?  Why, if the system is<br/>\nas good as you purport, are so many parents enraged by what their<br/>\nchildren are learning.  Why is there school<br/>\nviolence?
