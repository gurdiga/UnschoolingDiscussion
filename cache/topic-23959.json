It takes a while to get into the habit of<br/>\ndrinking that much.  I have suffered from joint pain which is now almost<br/>\ncompletely controlled when I drink enough water.  It also does wonders<br/>\nfor your skin.  I fill up water bottles, the required amount, and drink<br/>\nthem all day long.  <br/>\nAdding a zinc supplement to your diet a few days a week helps your skin<br/>\ntoo.  It&#39;s especially good for acne.  <br/>\nI have used kava kava for sleeplessness with great success.  Check for<br/>\ndrug interactions if you&#39;re taking prescriptions.  <br/>\nHave you tried ear plugs at night?  Some people can&#39;t stand them.  Might<br/>\nnot be an option if there is no one else to get up with baby,  or if baby<br/>\nis too little still to come to you. <br/>\nWe used a noise machine when my husband needed to sleep during the<br/>\ndaytime.  It creates a fuzzy, soft kind of sound which muffles outside<br/>\nnoise.  It really worked.  <br/>\nA fan would work too but sometimes it&#39;s too cold for a fan.<br/>\nI also use St. John&#39;s wort.  I have heard some people can&#39;t take it, but<br/>\nit really works for me.  I had trouble with worry while taking care of an<br/>\nill family member.  St. John&#39;s wort with kava kava has been a huge help. <br/>\n<br/>\nCalcium can sometimes help with pain, and aid in sleep.  If you wanted to<br/>\nstart simply you could try this.  ( with lots of water!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you can find some relief.  Maybe you would consider a visit to a<br/>\nnaturopath?  There may also be acupuncture or acupressure treatments that<br/>\ncan help.  <br/>\nHang in there.<br/>\nDeb L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;     I thought about more water yesterday actually. I have tired <br/>\n&gt; looking <br/>\n&gt; eyes.NOw sleep is a problem for sure. Pain wise it is difficult most <br/>\n&gt; nights. <br/>\n&gt; Also I am awoken by a child everynight and the cat and dog demands. <br/>\n&gt; I get so <br/>\n&gt; sick of it.
