I hand pieced my first <br/>\nquilt (took 2 years) and then just couldn&#39;t get the hang of hand quilting to <br/>\nwent to the machine.  I was pretty happy when I finished it, I don&#39;t think I <br/>\nhad ever finished ANY project before that quilt!  But I love quilts and I <br/>\nwant them in my house and I can&#39;t afford to buy them either.  At least if <br/>\nyou make them yourself, they are cheaper, they mean more to you and you can <br/>\nspread the cost out.  I&#39;ve since finished a quilt for each of my kids <br/>\n(simple block quilts, but got a little fancier on the quilting for my <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s) and a memory quilt for my mil.  I have FOUR wedding to attend <br/>\nthis year, the first one today and two others in June.  I have one top <br/>\npieced (I use the machine for everything now) and am ready to start cutting <br/>\nthe second.  In addition, my sister is having her first baby in August and <br/>\nmy mom was jealous of my mil&#39;s quilt, so I&#39;m trying to do a memory quilt for <br/>\nher for Xmas this year!  I have a lot of work ahead of me, but I love it and <br/>\nwhat a special gift I can give to others.  My family really doesn&#39;t have <br/>\nmuch of what you would call heirlooms (jewelry, etc.) but now they will!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I do everything by machine and am getting pretty good at machine <br/>\nquilting.  So far, I mainly stick to patterns in the many books that I have. <br/>\n  My favorite book is Quilt&#39;s from The Quiltmaker&#39;s Gifts.  I&#39;ve used the <br/>\nDouble Irish Chain from that, the Lover&#39;s Knot and my next one is Around the <br/>\nWorld.  They have great patters and are very easy to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry so long, like you, it is my passion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBonnie<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22017,"nextTopicId":22056}}
