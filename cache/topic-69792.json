That is <br/>\nnot fair to her.   In essence, you were saying &quot;tomorrow never comes&quot;.    I <br/>\ndon&#39;t even know how old your daughter was when she asked about smoking, I <br/>\ndidnt read the entire thread from the beginning.   And, in all liklihood, she <br/>\ndid just forget about smoking.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What about when she got old enough to recall those events and she thought  <br/>\n&quot;HEY, you tricked me!&quot;  Maybe you&#39;de get  lucky and  she wouldn&#39;t care.. <br/>\nmaybe she would even think it was funny.. But, maybe she would think.. Gee, <br/>\nhow much other stuff did she try to put over on me??... It seems you took <br/>\nadvantage of her innocence and niatevte by not just admiting, the next day <br/>\nwhen she asked about smoking again, that yes, it is &quot;tomorrow&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlena, I know how things get picked over and scrutinized.  I know how it <br/>\nfeels to hear  things that make you feel like folks are saying you are a bad <br/>\nmother.    The way you dealt with the smoking question was ( IMO) not the <br/>\nabsolute best way to handle it..But, that incident does NOT make you a bad <br/>\nmother. It means that you handled a situation in a way that seemed right to <br/>\nyou, and it seemed to work.  But, others have said that to them, it didnt <br/>\nseem like the BEST way to handle it.  Maybe it would help just to stop and <br/>\nthink about WHY folks feel you could have handled it differently.  Instead of <br/>\nbeing insulted, use the questioning and &quot;critisicm&quot; as a means to examine <br/>\nbetter ways of dealing with similar situations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69806,"nextTopicId":69639}}
