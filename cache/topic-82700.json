Accalia, 4 1/2,<br/>\nlikes to watch this show from time to time, but it&#39;s not a big deal either<br/>\nway. <br/>\nI only saw one of these, and it was all about the boys and men being turned <br/>\ninto girls and women and thinking it was the most horrible thing that ever <br/>\nhappened. They never came to any conclusions that being female would be anything <br/>\nless than horrible, and were finally changed back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was pretty horrified, and ranted for quite a while to the amusement of my <br/>\nnephew, who was watching this with me. (Sean was pretty much oblivious to the <br/>\nplot...the tv was on, but he was paying only minor attention to it. &gt;I&lt; on the <br/>\nother hand, cracked him up.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh...we don&#39;t restrict stuff either. I do share my opinions and ask <br/>\nquestions. ANd when Julian was little I used to sing &quot;Barney is a dinosaur who feeds on <br/>\nlittle children...&quot; which cracked HIM up, and made him want to watch it more, <br/>\nso that I would sing it....<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82695,"nextTopicId":82684}}
