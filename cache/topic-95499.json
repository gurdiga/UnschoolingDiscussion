It was the only homeschooling approach I seriously considered.<br/>\n <br/>\nI checked our public library for a copy of Abelard and Heloise, and found a link to the Medieval Sourcebook&#39;s electronic edition of Peter Abelard&#39;s Historia Calamitatum, translated from Latin in 1922. You can find it at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/abelard-histcal.html.\">http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/abelard-histcal.html.</a> Here is a clip from their introduction:<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;The Historia Calamitatum, although in the literary form of a letter, is a sort of autobiography, with distinct echoes of Augustine&#39;s Confessions. It is one of the most readable documents to survive from the period, and as well as presenting a remarkably frank self-portrait, is a valuable account of intellectual life in Paris before the formalization of the University, of the intellectual excitement of the period, of monastic life and of a love story that in some respects deserves its long reputation.&quot;  <br/>\ndebbie gubernick<br/>\ntucson<br/>\n<br/>\nMark & Julie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mjsolich@...\">mjsolich@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like Abelard and Heloise to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s it!
