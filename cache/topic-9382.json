First mom checks three books on electricity out of the library,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; then the kids make models of lightbulbs, read a biography of Thomas<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Edison and do a skit based on his life. Next, everyone studies the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; history of lighting methods, wrapping up with dipping their own<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; candles. Next, everyone takes a trip to the store where they<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; compare types of light bulbs as well as prices and figure out how<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; much change they&#39;ll get if they buy two bulbs for $1.99 and pay<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; with a five dollar bill. On the way home, a discussion develops<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; over the history of money and also Abraham Lincoln, as his picture<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; is on the five dollar bill. Finally, after building a homemade<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ladder out of branches dragged from the woods, the light bulb is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; installed. And there is light!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; [copied from a newsletter for homeschoolers, and they got it from<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; several emails they had received :-)   -- pass it on to someone you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; know who homeschools!]<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ======================<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Forward to a friend! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9375,"nextTopicId":9386}}
