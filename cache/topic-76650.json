We are running a small Whisper brand filter, change the cartridge regularly, and have an aeration strip in the tank.  There is no heater and no light other than the natural room light.  We have small rocks in the bottom of the tank, a few decorative larger aquarium rocks.   The goldfish are just small &quot;feeder fish&quot; (maybe 2 inches in length), and have a ton of room in there.  We are keeping the glass algae-free by scraping, and we change 3/4 of the water in the tank by suction vaccuming from the bottom of the tank, then adding fresh water back in in small batches (allowing it to come to room temperature first).  Still, the water is a dense green color, so thick that you can&#39;t see the fish unless they are right at the edge, and can&#39;t see the rocks.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve resorted to trying a chemical algicide, but it seems to not have any effect at the reccommended dosages, and I&#39;m afraid to go any stronger with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  HELP!!  My son is quite attached to these fish, and is upset that he can&#39;t see them in their tank anymore.  Besides which, that can&#39;t be healthy for them!  Thanks to anyone who has experience with this sort of thing!  I kept tropical fish in a 29 gallon aquarium for years without this problem, can&#39;t figure out what I&#39;m doing wrong this time around!<br/>\n<br/>\n  --Shelley, Mommy to Jacob (2 1/2 yrs) and Gabriel (4 mos)<br/>\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n    Harvest Moon -- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:harvest.moon@...\">harvest.moon@...</a><br/>\n    Working Rough and Smooth Collies<br/>\n    www.geocities.com/harvestmooncollies<br/>\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

If the water is <br/>\nalso cloudy, you&#39;re probably overfeeding. Our book said to feed the fish <br/>\nonly as much as they&#39;d eat in 3 minutes, twice a day. It also said to <br/>\nNOT feed them one day a week, and not if you&#39;re going out of town for <br/>\nless than a week. We went away for 4 days and came back to a *beautiful* <br/>\ntank. No cloudiness, no algae.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey said the algae grows on the overfeeding and will also grow more <br/>\nwith plenty of light (like sunlight).<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n:-) Diane<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I&#39;m hoping someone here knows something about fish tanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My son has 3 goldfish in a 10 gallon aquarium tank, and we have an out of control algae problem. <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] OT:  need fish tank help","postDate":"1058484367","msgId":76668,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDkwMWMzNGNiYSRjY2ZiZmMwMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDEwNTg0NzQ1MDkuMTU1MS42NzQzLm0xM0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDwwMWVmMDFjMzRjYjUkZGMwMWMxODAkNmQ1OWM3ZDFAUzAwMjY2NDU1MzU+"},"prevInTopic":76666,"nextInTopic":76669,"prevInTime":76667,"nextInTime":76669,"topicId":76650,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: pink lantern  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1346590167\">From: &quot;pink lantern&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pinklantern@...\">pinklantern@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&quot;Pleco&quot; in the tank.

(waste from the fish) People say goldfish are very dirty and<br/>\nthe water is full of ammonia. I have a 30 gal tank full of fancy goldfish<br/>\nonly and never have any problems. I also have a light on the tank that I<br/>\nkeep on every evening. I test my water weekly and every 4-6 weeks do a water<br/>\nchange. Only about 25-30% at the most. It&#39;s a matter of feeding the fish.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t want to use any chemicals, start by doing water changes. Do a<br/>\nwater change every day, 20% ONLY and no more. Condition the new water and<br/>\nmake sure the temp is the same when you add it. Keep doing this until the<br/>\nwater is clear. You can clean off the algae with a scraper ahead of time so<br/>\nthe vacuum gets the fallen algae. You said you have no light. Is the tank<br/>\nnear a sunny window? Does it get lots of natural light? If so, moving the<br/>\ntank will help. If not, cut down on how much you feed the fish. Most people<br/>\nover feed fish. Goldfish are pigs and will act starving every minute of the<br/>\nday. You can feed the fish once or even 3 times day as long as it&#39;s not too<br/>\nmuch. Feed very, very small amounts and make sure the fish are eating what<br/>\nyou feed. Once you see flakes or crumbs falling onto the rocks, stop<br/>\nfeeding. If you use flake food, try one flake at a time. That should do the<br/>\ntrick as you say you are changing the filter too.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you get it under control, you can buy a pleco if you want also. I like<br/>\nthe pleco&#39;s better than the algae eaters. He&#39;ll take care of any excess as<br/>\nlong as it&#39;s not too much. Then a 25 % water change once a month should do<br/>\nthe trick. Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"genant2@aol.com","from":"genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] OT:  need fish tank help","postDate":"1058471559","msgId":76652,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlmLjNiNWFkZmFmLjJjNDg1ODg3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76650,"nextInTopic":76658,"prevInTime":76651,"nextInTime":76653,"topicId":76650,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Gold fish seem to be rather dirty fish if you get my meaning.
