Ha!  That<br/>\nusually gets me some strange looks...<br/>\nI remember precisely when I decided I would homeschool.  My oldest son (now8)<br/>\nwas 2 at the time.  He was running down the hill to the barn laughing and<br/>\nlaughing.  It suddenly hit me that he would be going to school in 3 short<br/>\nyears possibly earlier!  My heart just collapsed and I couldn&#39;t even think of<br/>\nthe possibility of him going away for the whole day.  I would miss him<br/>\nterribly, he would miss me, and there is always something interesting to do<br/>\non a farm.  He would miss so much life!  That did it, I started researching<br/>\nright then.  I read and read and read ect....  I read John Holt, old Growing<br/>\nWithout Schooling Magazines, Old Home Education Magazines, and every book I<br/>\nsaw mentioned in the back of other books.  I specifically drawn to John Holt<br/>\nand Grace Llewellyn.  I learned from everything I read though.  It made me<br/>\nsee how diverse homeschooling can be.<br/>\nI also researched the laws for my state during this time.<br/>\nI also looked into support groups, and made contact with a local one.  It was<br/>\ninteresting to talk to everyone but my sons (we had added one during this<br/>\ntime) were much too young to do much.  I then renewed contact later when all<br/>\nthree of my kids were older.<br/>\nI still read and read....  I still talk and talk....  It helps to share.<br/>\nI hope this helps you...and enjoy your family.  That is what we do mostly.<br/>\nAnn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"louisam1@juno.com","from":"louisam1@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"0BkAdW3R7knUNiPCiEn4vrqov1YZaZDw05Qe9OYUnE1ZAwxsFlelY8RDc5GjNHWnGGii74G66k0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Just Curious","postDate":"993148130","msgId":22671,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwNjIxLjExNTAwOS4tNDYzOTE3LjMubG91aXNhbTFAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":22667,"nextInTopic":22672,"prevInTime":22670,"nextInTime":22672,"topicId":22660,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2000827206\">&lt;&lt;For the last two months we&#39;ve been <br/>\ndiscussing the idea of home schooling and this is our first inquiries <br/>\nto people who are doing the do.
