Never again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have to reply here, cuz that is so true about adults<br/>\nand their close mindedness. I am the 5th of 6<br/>\nchildren, the first four are 12-17 yrs older than me<br/>\n(quite a gap), and of them ONE graduated from ps. (Of<br/>\nher own choice). The rest my dad had to fight to be<br/>\nable to &quot;homeschool&quot; (which ended up being<br/>\nunschooling) them, and so by the time I was old enough<br/>\nto put in school, he knew he didn&#39;t really want to,<br/>\nbut he had had so much negative thoughts on<br/>\nhomeschooling thrown his way (that his kids wouldnt&#39;<br/>\nlearn as much, that they would be socially and<br/>\nacademically handicapped, that their lives would be<br/>\ntoo sheltered, etc, etc, AND that the kids actually<br/>\nLIKED school and he was depriving them)<br/>\nthat I remember after I had turned 5, he, very<br/>\nreluctantly sighed and asked me &quot;do you WANT to go to<br/>\nschool? If you WANT to I guess you can.&quot; and I<br/>\nremember thinking, I am soooo cool. I can decide<br/>\nwhether or not to go to school. and I said no, (to his<br/>\ndelight)and stayed at home all that year, learning at<br/>\nhome in absolutely no structured way, just my mom<br/>\ncreatively teaching me in play that my friends never<br/>\ndreamt of having, both my parents and older siblings<br/>\nreading to me several times a day and ALWAYS before<br/>\nbed. Then the next year my &quot;best friend&quot; started first<br/>\ngrade and all the other kids that I knew from my<br/>\nreligion were starting school too, so I decided I<br/>\nwanted to go. And to tell the truth in first grade I<br/>\nhad a blast. But only becuz I happened to have a<br/>\nsmaller class and the coolest teacher there, who<br/>\ndidn&#39;t believe in traditional school methods and<br/>\npacing. and thought if we wanted to learn cursive in<br/>\nfirst grade then she would teach us, if I wanted to<br/>\nuse three pages and three days worth of story in my<br/>\nsquiggle book, as opposed to the assigned one<br/>\npage/day, then &#39;go for it, you&#39;ll be a great writer&#39;,<br/>\nand if we still needed to count on our fingers to<br/>\nfigure things out, then we were allowed to. And here&#39;s<br/>\nthe cool part. I was further advanced in reading than<br/>\nthe other kids who had faithfully gone to kindergarten<br/>\nto learn their abc&#39;s like good little &quot;normal&quot; kids,<br/>\nso I got to go a different grade and classroom for a<br/>\nspecial reading time and sometimes read to the younger<br/>\nkids. I stayed in ps thru 3rd grade, (in 2nd, I saw my<br/>\nactual teacher about a third of the year cuz of<br/>\nhorrible health problems, and we had substitutes for<br/>\nmost of the year and a huge class, so needless to say<br/>\nI was pretty bored, and just went to see my friends<br/>\nand play for those blessed 15 minute recesses of<br/>\nplaying freedom), in 3rd grade, the only thing I<br/>\nreally enjoyed was going to &quot;gifted class&quot;, where we<br/>\nwere encouraged to do our own thing and learn at our<br/>\nown pace. Oh, and since I was raised as a Jehovah&#39;s<br/>\nWitness and didn&#39;t celebrate a lot of the holidays, I<br/>\nwas sent to the Library while the rest of the enormous<br/>\nclass did holiday activities, which was just fine with<br/>\nme, cuz reading was what I really enjoyed, --other<br/>\nthan daydreaming, which was considered something &quot;bad&quot;<br/>\n(ex: &quot;Bobbie&#39;s a really great student, has lots and<br/>\nlots of potential, BUT daydreams a bit too much&quot;),--<br/>\nand that way I didn&#39;t have to stay and be made to feel<br/>\nbad about my beliefs by the TEACHER, who wanted sooo<br/>\nbad to prove that I really truly did WANT so bad to<br/>\ncelebrate them and my parents were just being mean to<br/>\nme. The kids, being naturally unbiased and open minded<br/>\nnever said a thing more to me about it than asking<br/>\nquestions cuz it was something different to them. On<br/>\nthe other end of it, I obviously wasn&#39;t getting math,<br/>\nI NEVER did my math or social studies types of<br/>\nhomework and would therefore end up having to stay in<br/>\nduring recess and write &quot;I will do my math homework. I<br/>\nwill do my math homework. I will do my math homework.&quot;<br/>\nand THEN if I didn&#39;t finish that (due to daydreaming,<br/>\nmost likely) I had to write more sentences. And in my<br/>\nschool, at 3rd grade there was already horrible social<br/>\ncircles and cliques to try and fit into. I was in<br/>\nneither the cool nor nerd group, cuz my cool friends<br/>\nliked me but didn&#39;t like that I also liked and hung<br/>\nout with weird and nerdy kids, and my weird and nerdy<br/>\nfriends thought I must be kinda stuck up to hang out<br/>\nand like the cool kids. I lived in constant fear of<br/>\ngoing to the principal&#39;s office for anything and was<br/>\nso scared riding the bus, cuz I lived in a rural area<br/>\nand was dropped off at the end of my &quot;driveway&quot;, which<br/>\nwas really a dirt road that seemed millions of miles<br/>\nlong to a little easily frightened girl. In the middle<br/>\nof third grade, our house burned down, and my dad&#39;s<br/>\nbrother was living in Phoenix, where he had heard of<br/>\nthis &quot;private school&quot; (which was what I like to call a<br/>\n&quot;homemade school&quot;, just started by a few like-minded<br/>\nparents who wanted to be in charge of their kids and<br/>\ntheir learning activities and associations and still<br/>\nlet them have a &quot;school&quot; with friends to go to.) So me<br/>\nand my little sister (2yrs younger) went there, and my<br/>\nmom and oldest sister became teachers there, and I had<br/>\na great time. I went thru 5th, (my mom taught<br/>\n5th..there was only one class per grade) and I loved<br/>\nit, but mostly becuz it was sooo unstructured, and<br/>\nhuge amounts of personal attention. The teachers were<br/>\nlike extended family, who respected your strengths and<br/>\nweaknesses and beliefs and my dad was almost the<br/>\nprincipal at one point. Then we decided to move back<br/>\nto New Mexico and I said there was no way on God&#39;s<br/>\ngreen earth I was going to go to middle school. So I<br/>\ntook Calvert homeschool. Or at least ordered the<br/>\ncourse and did some work out of it every once and<br/>\nawhile. Then ordered American school, and still like<br/>\nto study in those just for the sake of refreshing my<br/>\nbrain cells sometimes. All of my friends have always<br/>\nbeen older than me. Not becuz I was socially<br/>\nhandicapped with kids my age, but becuz frankly, they<br/>\nbored me. And irritated me with their pettiness in<br/>\nalways trying to be &quot;cool&quot; and fit in. My best friend<br/>\nfor a long time was 6 years older than me and people<br/>\nalways thought she must be babysitting me. :) My<br/>\npoint? oh yeah. (I promise there is one)<br/>\nHomeschooling kids ARE different. They haven&#39;t been<br/>\ncorrupted with the need to conform in every way of<br/>\ntheir being, right down to the way they think and how<br/>\nlong they think on each subject, and HEAVEN FORBID<br/>\nthey use their imaginations to their full potential. <br/>\nAnd the reason I got started on this whole tangent<br/>\n(THANKYOU BOBBIE PLEEEEZE FINISH UP HERE) is that as<br/>\nan adult, by nature, I suppose, I deal with a lot of<br/>\nsocial phobia (in myself) and there was a point in my<br/>\nlife where it was really bad, and in general have<br/>\ndealt with phobias and stuff like that my whole life.<br/>\nI don&#39;t like dealing with public figures and dread<br/>\nhaving confrontations of any sort sometimes. My POINT<br/>\nthough, is, that when other ADULTS hear this about me,<br/>\nthey have the nerve to say &quot;Oh yeah, weren&#39;t you<br/>\nhomeschooled?&quot; And I have heard the argument soooooo<br/>\nmany times that the homeschooled kids they know either<br/>\ngrow up to be way dumber than most kids or way<br/>\nsmarter, but either way are socially handicapped and<br/>\ndon&#39;t know how to interact with others at all in their<br/>\nadult life. I maintain that PUBLIC School started<br/>\nplanting the seeds of social phobia and handicapping<br/>\nin me, cuz I was &quot;different&quot; and didn&#39;t fit the mold<br/>\nof a &quot;normal&quot; all American apple pie sort of girl, so<br/>\nI was made to feel as though I needed to change.<br/>\nFortunately, thanks to my parents teaching me at home<br/>\nBEFORE first grade, I had that one thing going for me,<br/>\nthat I loved to read, and was at a middle school level<br/>\nin 3rd grade, and the &quot;gifted class&quot; teachers loved<br/>\nthat. But kids who are just thrown into school feet<br/>\nfirst and aren&#39;t considered &quot;gifted&quot; don&#39;t even have<br/>\nTHAT advantage. One ounce of &quot;different&quot; and they are<br/>\neither in need of Ritalin or &quot;poor students&quot;. I think<br/>\nunschooling PREVENTS social handicaps and helps heal<br/>\nalready planted ones, especially if we do expose our<br/>\nchildren to other people and situations. My son is the<br/>\nonly kid at McDonald&#39;s playlands and parks who<br/>\nactually takes the initiative and says in his most<br/>\nfriendly voice &quot;Hi. I&#39;m my name is Satori. Wanna play<br/>\nwith me?&quot; Sometimes he meets no answer at all, cuz,<br/>\nfollowing in the footsteps of his mom he is by no<br/>\nmeans &quot;normal&quot; and sadly a lot of these kids are<br/>\nalready behaving like biased adults. THAT, to me, is a<br/>\nsocial handicap. <br/>\n-Bobbie <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
