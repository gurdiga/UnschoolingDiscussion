I have discussed it with them - Did it not turn out to be what they<br/>\nwanted or expected? (which, I think, has been the case most of the time),<br/>\nDid things change on them?  (a musical dd was involved in added a bunch of<br/>\nSaturday rehearsals at the last minute (along with the Wednesday<br/>\nrehearsals), and we were already busy those Saturdays.  That time, we talked<br/>\nabout it with the director and dd just missed a few (she was only a chorus<br/>\nmember)), How would they feel if they left?, or How would they feel if they<br/>\nstayed?
