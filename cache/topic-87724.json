They could even put up a whole area of heavy paper and <br/>\npaint it with any color they choose.<br/>\n  <br/>\n   And painting in closets is a wonderful idea...especially if the colors <br/>\nwould contrast too much with the house &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;. I read somewhere if you are <br/>\npassionate about a color, to paint that color inside a cabinet or a heavily used <br/>\ncloset..that way it can brighten your day without compromising your home&#39;s color <br/>\nscheme &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>\n  I had to compromise with my 7ds a bit, who wanted to paint all the wooden <br/>\nwalls in his bedroom , even the log wall! (gasp!), BLACK and paint stars in <br/>\nflourescent glow-in-the-dark paint. <br/>\nI do admire his creativity though :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marcia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:children&#39;s rooms","postDate":"1073174030","msgId":87724,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkYS4xN2QzOTgxMy4yZDI4YjAwZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":87726,"prevInTime":87723,"nextInTime":87725,"topicId":87724,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/3/2004 6:20:08 PM Eastern Standard Time, UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com writes: I was reading some teen novel I picked up at my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-549161023\">In a message dated 1/3/2004 6:20:08 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\nI was reading some teen novel I picked up at my friend&#39;s house and the <br/>\ncharacter mentions that her walls are covered in her own artwork directly on the <br/>\nwalls...graffiti-like.
