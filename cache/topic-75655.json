I have been before in different places, but this is <br/>\nthe first time it&#39;s been so close, and my family is joining me.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday was the first day we attended, and Julian and I went in. It was so <br/>\ncool doing this with him. He had the option of us registering him and doing <br/>\nall the youth stuff, but he wanted to go along with me. We did three workshops, <br/>\ntwo of which were exceptional. The first was on modern slavery (there are more <br/>\nslaves in the world today than any time in history, including many in the <br/>\nUS), and was incredible. If anyone wants to hear more, I&#39;d be happy to share. <br/>\nJulian was amazed, and wants to do some social action.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second was on marriage rights, and the panel included reps from Canada, <br/>\nVT, CT, and the main plaintiff in the MA case re: same sex marriage. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also wandered the Exhibit hall, which has so much interesting stuff it&#39;s <br/>\namazing! There were also lots of people who hadn&#39;t seen Julian in a long time, <br/>\nso I got to show off my tall, cool boy (which Julian actually just loves. He <br/>\nsmiles, talks about stuff he&#39;s doing, and stands VERY tall!).<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly it was a nice, exhausting day, and we have a couple more. It&#39;s also so <br/>\ncool that in one weekend Julian will hear people like Tom Hayden, Julian <br/>\nBond, Frances Moore Lappe, etc. speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75656,"nextTopicId":75621}}
