I WOULD NOT want to take my car to a brain surgeon to have him fix my engine and I wouldn&#39;t want to go to the mechanic to have my brain operated on.   I believe that we should respect each job and each human being, whether we totally agree with it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharles in TX<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] again.. even finer?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;lovemary wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;is it better to be a doctor or teacher than a garbage man <br/>\n  &gt; or a dishwasher? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Well I sure don&#39;t know about how the rest of y&#39;all feel, but I know that <br/>\n  it was the sanitation conditions (hence workers and foremen) that got rid <br/>\n  of some of the most horrifying plagues in the 20th century, not the <br/>\n  exhaulted doctors that were powerless in all their self-righteous <br/>\n  mightiness.<br/>\n<br/>\n  warm regards,<br/>\n  kolleen<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
