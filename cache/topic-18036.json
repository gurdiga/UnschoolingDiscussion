According to those articles, the evidence that Indians were<br/>\nhere at all before 11,800 years ago is still hotly debated, and &quot;long before&quot;,<br/>\nwell, depends on what you mean by &#39;long&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a layer in the strata called Clovis, from the site it was first found<br/>\nat.  This layer and its distinctive tools are pretty much found throughout the<br/>\nAmericas.  The oldest dated artifacts are from 11,800 years Before Present,<br/>\ncorresponding with the Bering land bridge having been blocked by ice between<br/>\n13,000 and 12,000 years BP.  Also corresponding with lots of large animals<br/>\ngoing extinct in North America.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are various other sites with claims of dates before Clovis, the oldest<br/>\nbeing Meadowcroft in Pennsylvania, with a claim of 19,000 years BP.  None of<br/>\nthese have been embraced by the scientific community, with questions about<br/>\neither the dates or the human origin of the alleged stone tools.  (And with<br/>\nPennsylvania, I have to wonder who would have been living there then --<br/>\nperhaps people swept away from Europe or Africa.  No human bones were<br/>\nmentioned in this article.)  All of these sites are scattered in space and<br/>\ntime; Clovis is pervasive, like a plague of superbugs. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no hint of questioning of the land bridge idea, which makes perfect<br/>\nsense: glaciers lower the sea level, but block the exposed land, except for a<br/>\nbrief window.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there were humans everywhere a bit after 12,000 years ago (sorry for being<br/>\noff 1000 in my first post) and possibly some before then, but we&#39;re not sure,<br/>\nand not sure how they&#39;d have gotten there, and they didn&#39;t get far.

Doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;d want to risk aerobraking large asteroids<br/>\ninto Earth orbit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut my point in replying to Wendy wasn&#39;t to allocate blame, it was to point<br/>\nout that humans have affected their environment, and with primitive<br/>\ntechnology.  Humans have occasionally destroyed their local environment.  6<br/>\nbillion humans with modern tools are not like ants.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Which is a bad example anyway; _ants_ aren&#39;t like &#39;ants&#39;.  Something to get<br/>\nyour kids interested in, perhaps: most of the animal biomass is insects and<br/>\nworms, and most of the insects are ants.  (Although there are more species of<br/>\nbeetle.)  I&#39;m fairly sure I&#39;ve read that ants have major roles in the<br/>\necosystem, and if ants species went extinct things would collapse, at least<br/>\nfor a while.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we&#39;ve had Collette saying humans are like a plague of superbugs, and Wendy<br/>\nsaying we&#39;re like ants and the Earth will survive anything we do, and for all<br/>\nmy earlier arguing with Collette and Robin I&#39;m closer to their position.  We<br/>\ncertainly have the power to be a plague of superbugs; my argument was simply<br/>\nagainst exagerrating problems.  It&#39;s not as if they need it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And so we&#39;re not so guilty--we just have fancier tools.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, this isn&#39;t about guilt.  Guilt&#39;s pointless, here.  I&#39;m not here to say<br/>\n&quot;bad aborigines, you wiped out all those species!&quot;  Or even &quot;bad Brazilians,<br/>\ncutting down all those rainforests!&quot;  But it happened, and it&#39;s happening, and<br/>\nif we have a light impact on the Earth it&#39;ll be because we work for that, not<br/>\nbecause the Earth is big.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople used to not worry about overfishing or overhunting because hey, the<br/>\nEarth is big, there are lots of animals, we couldn&#39;t really hunt enough to<br/>\nwipe out a whole species, could we?  Oops.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What would the Easter Island natives have done to amend the problem with what <br/>\n&gt; they knew?  Plant trees?

A \n  lot of people<br>cared enough to cause changes to occur and continue to care. \n  Personally I<br>grew up next to a river that in the seventies was so polluted, \n  you could<br>smell it from a mile away. We used to watch the fish floating \n  belly up all<br>the time. If we even touched the water, my grandmother would \n  &quot;sterilize&quot; us.<br>Businesses were forced to change their practices and \n  citizens were taught<br>better habits for the river. Education can be powerful \n  when applied. By the<br>time my children arrived, the river was clean enough \n  to swim in. A boating<br>house and two excellent parks were opened. Our earth \n  has a great capacity to<br>repair and clean itself. If we work towards helping \n  the earth in this<br>natural process as much as we can, we will have more good \n  sources for fresh<br>clean water and places for recreation. \n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>I agree with you Johanna. But I also think that \n  the reason some things have<br>gotten better is because a lot of &quot;doom and \n  gloomers&quot; took the time and<br>energy to be outspoken. Without the &quot;save the \n  whales&quot; and &quot;treehugger&quot;<br>types, I think things would be much, much worse \n  than they are. Sandra was<br>putting down someone who was strongly stating her \n  preferences for leading an<br>earth-friendly lifestyle by saying that all \n  those terrible things that were<br>predicted haven&#39;t happened. Well, the \n  reason they haven&#39;t happened is that<br>some people have been vocal enough \n  about leading earth-friendly lifestyles<br>and effecting change! Every single \n  person who changes even one earth-hurting<br>behavior is helping us towards a \n  healthier earth. The other day in the store<br>I saw that Western Family (big \n  major US brand) makes organic apple juice<br>now, and Gold Medal makes organic \n  flour. That would never happen without all<br>those people &quot;voting with their \n  dollars&quot; and buying organic. I think it&#39;s<br>awesome to see that soon regular \n  consumers in regular grocery stores will<br>have organic food to choose from \n  when they shop. But it took all those years<br>of hippies and food co-ops to \n  get to that point. Instead of scorning those<br>who sound the alarm, let&#39;s say \n  thanks to all who have gone before use and<br>given us the ability to make the \n  choices we have today!<br>And also, let&#39;s not rest on our laurels. Here in \n  Oregon, the Willamette<br>River was one of those &quot;success&quot; stories like you \n  mentioned. A previously<br>filthy river that was cleaned up in the 70&#39;s and \n  became beautiful and<br>swimmable. Well, now it is very polluted again and \n  they are urging us not to<br>swim in it anymore. So we must be ever vigilant \n  even about the changes we<br>have wrought. We have an enormous impact on the \n  whole earth. Women in the<br>few small aboriginal tribes left on earth have \n  environmental pollutants in<br>their breastmilk. I&#39;ve personally traveled to \n  remote uninhabited beaches<br>halfway around the world and seen garbage \n  washing up on the shore. I&#39;m<br>reminded of that 70&#39;s commercial with the \n  crying Indian, that&#39;s sometimes<br>how it feels.<br><br>Blue \n  Skies!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; -Robin-<br>Mom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;My pants are \n  outgrowing me&quot;<br>and Asa (10/5/99) &quot;Potty pee!
