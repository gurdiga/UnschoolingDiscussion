I think it is up to the married couple to <br/>\nlearn and teach together!  Before my daughter got married I gave her <br/>\nseveral Christian books on the sex act and we talked about her <br/>\nfears, but I didn&#39;t tell her HOW to please her husband or HOW to <br/>\ngive pleasure.  First of all, I think she would naturally learn that <br/>\n(and has) and that each couple is different and their way might not <br/>\nbe my way!  I am certainly open to learning new things from my <br/>\nspouse or with my spouse and experimenting a little, but I also do <br/>\nnot need a game to do so.  I guess my main fear would be that a game <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t do the act justice.  As a Christian, I above all keep the <br/>\nmarriage act a sacred thing.  By that I mean I would not introduce <br/>\npornography or anything that made it into what the world sees sex <br/>\nas.   Whether or not your Karma Sutra game does that, I don&#39;t know.  <br/>\nI just assumed it was more of a *kinky* game not for Christians.  I <br/>\nmost certainly could be wrong about that, and am sorry if my <br/>\nassumption was incorrect.   I guess I might have a little trouble <br/>\nexplaining the cinnamon gel in my drawer, but if age appropriate, I <br/>\nwould explain if a child came across it.  <br/>\n  On that note, is anyone else bothered my the freely used &quot;f&quot; word <br/>\non these postings?   I am very surprised to see it used so freely by <br/>\nwomen today.   Or am I the only one it bothers?????<br/>\nMary, IA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43710,"nextTopicId":43669}}
