But, this<br/>\ntime lately, too, has been just filled with bickering<br/>\nabout who is going to sit where and what blanket they<br/>\nwant and pretty soon I lose my temper because I&#39;m just<br/>\nso tired of hearing all these problems over nothing!<br/>\n<br/>\nWow Carol...we&#39;re living parallel lives. Last night it almost killed me to<br/>\nget through 2 chapters of a book. The youngest got into a bag of sugar and<br/>\ntalked non-stop, another was jumping on the couch, and the other two just<br/>\nkept plain interrupting and crabbing at the others. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where I just get up and leave and go do something else.  If they<br/>\nwon&#39;t sit still or stop bickering etc, then they aren&#39;t interested in the<br/>\nbook, activity, or whatever.  I just go do something for myself.  If they<br/>\nreally want the story, they&#39;ll shape up pretty fast.  If not, then no story.<br/>\nLots of this stuff is for attention only (mom&#39;s attention).  When it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork, they usually cut it out.  This doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t do it again<br/>\nanother day, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________<br/>\nWhy pay for something you could get for free?<br/>\nNetZero provides FREE Internet Access and Email<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.netzero.net/download/index.html\">http://www.netzero.net/download/index.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"CluQgaNk9m_GjHaXiFeNwRnLKEH5skCr97XCRnHHV0Ck8PxslbeL3N3vzj3L_QHwB5dPt8UImokq","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 864","postDate":"974218043","msgId":14135,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0LmI4ZjJhMjguMjc0MmJkM2JAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":14108,"nextInTopic":14152,"prevInTime":14134,"nextInTime":14136,"topicId":14108,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 00-11-12 15:51:47 EST, benliam@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-301030927\">In a message dated 00-11-12 15:51:47 EST, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:benliam@...\">benliam@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Can I ask a question about your 7 year old, who you think might be adhd, <br/>\nif <br/>\n you tested him?  what was he like when he was 3??
