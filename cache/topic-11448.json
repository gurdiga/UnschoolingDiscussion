Adults  and even","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1817240506\">My son the herper says wild caught garter snakes just don&#39;t do well at all<br/>\nin captivity.    Babies are about 3 inches long and eat worms.  Adults  and<br/>\neven juveniles may eat fish or frogs but it all depends on where it came<br/>\nfrom.    They have a very wide range  where they are found in the wild.<br/>\nSo you have to worry not only about finding the right size but whether  it<br/>\nwill even be attracted to it in its very stressed state.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally the best thing is to release it.        It you know what kind of<br/>\nterrain it was originally captured from,   it would be good to try to<br/>\nrelease it somewhere similar and preferably in a place without a lot of<br/>\nhuman traffic. .  But if you have a garden,   that would probably be fine<br/>\ntoo and you could hope to see it again :-).             It is probably not<br/>\nstarving yet.   Reptiles can go long periods without food.  It is the stress<br/>\nwhich is harming it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvening a good time to turn it loose---especially if you are in a part of<br/>\nthe country with sizzling afternoons.    Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nVicki<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.:   When my children were much younger they were usually very receptive<br/>\nto the idea that an animal needed to go find its mama   or that the mama<br/>\nneeded to get back to her babies!      Stretching the  science a bit does<br/>\nnot seem to have harmed them or made them distrustful of me:-).       It was<br/>\na means for them to understand &quot;humane&quot;  treatment.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"D Klement","from":"D Klement &lt;klement@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"cwD6I_-zZ9d85_kwfRnqSWhRV0YzqUEF6ToNGhK5g4AGykxw5TSCGcmILZ2lMhOg_3m7hqv01OZPjVjctuESVv-j8_oD4KMY","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] feeding baby snake?","postDate":"964215517","msgId":11450,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5NzhDMkRELjQ4MTczQkM5QGludGVybHlueC5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDk2NDE3NDI2MC4yMTYxNkBlZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDM5NzMwMTI5LkE4MTI2RTQ1QHRlbHVzcGxhbmV0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":11449,"nextInTopic":11451,"prevInTime":11449,"nextInTime":11451,"topicId":11448,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
