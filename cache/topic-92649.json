Some families get so into it that they&#39;ll be angry with <br/>\npeople like me for not sending their postcard NOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had dozens from California and Texas, and that meant my obligation was to <br/>\nSEND dozens back.  So the expense to people in less populated areas can be <br/>\npretty big.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do join, please go easy on people from Wyoming, for instance.  Maybe <br/>\nit should be a math project. &lt;g&gt;   I was on another list, not this one but <br/>\nstill:  There were states with dozens of families and for a while there were TWO <br/>\nfamilies in New Mexico, and one dropped, and then I dropped, but still got some <br/>\ntacky &quot;we need a New Mexico post card, you lazy slacker bum&quot; cards for a <br/>\nwhile thereafter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd some people were adamant that they wanted MAPS or capital buildings or <br/>\nstate birds.  HUH!  I had bought what I thought was pretty and representative <br/>\nand that I could afford.  I couldn&#39;t afford to buy exactly what each family <br/>\nwould like to have from New Mexico.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other ways to get information about (and even from) other places <br/>\nthan by hounding volunteers. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere.  I&#39;ve said my piece.<br/>\nAnd having said that, if you remind your kids that some places are sparsely <br/>\npopulated, I would really appreciate it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe used to scan the list for families with anyone named our kids&#39; names, or <br/>\naddresses that were interesting.   There has to be SOME criteria for answering, <br/>\nand the idea that each family would send 49 cards and get 49 cards back was <br/>\nSO lacking in logical forethought that I was appalled.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this list isn&#39;t that list.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter at your own risk.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/postcardkids/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/postcardkids/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNot an endorsement.
