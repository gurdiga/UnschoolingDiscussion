The scenes of Corfu life are beautiful and so detailed.<br/>\nSome of Gerald Durrell&#39;s other books are out on audio and very funny and<br/>\ninteresting. His early life is truly inspirational for unschoolers. His<br/>\nbrother was the famous author Lawrence Durrell.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;    From: &quot;Heather Young&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heatherflower8@...\">heatherflower8@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have read and loved Gerald Durrell&#39;s book &quot;My Family And Other Animals&quot; which is about a couple years of his<br/>\n&gt; youth spent on the island of Corfu in Greece.  Recently I found the movie, called the same, and it was well done, by<br/>\n&gt; the BBC who does many wonderful movies.  The movies shows how he spends hours and hours watching the bugs<br/>\n&gt; and wildlife on the island learning about how the live.  He meets all kinds of people who teach him more things.  A<br/>\n&gt; well meaning friend tells the mother that he needs tutor to be &quot;educate&quot;.  He goes through a few tutors who cannot<br/>\n&gt; undertand how to teach this strange little boy who loves all things animal related.  He meets some fascinating people<br/>\n&gt; along the way and essentially unschools himself in spite of the well-meaning tutors.  The great thing is that this<br/>\n&gt; movie is based on the real life of Gerald Durrell and there are more books by him and about his experiences with<br/>\n&gt; animals all over the world if your.  I will say that there are a couple references to sex by Gerry&#39;s older brother and<br/>\n&gt; sister but no nudity or suggestive scenes.  The nature photography is wonderful and the boy who plays Gerry is<br/>\n&gt; great.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Heather </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51451,"nextTopicId":31595}}
