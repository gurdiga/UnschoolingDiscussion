The reason is that a buzzard always begins a flight<br/>\nfrom the ground with a run of ten or twelve feet. Without space to run,<br/>\nas is his habit, he will not even attempt to fly, but will remain a<br/>\nprisoner for life in a small jail with no top.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ordinary bat that flies around at night, a remarkable nimble<br/>\ncreature in the air, cannot take off from a level place. If it is placed<br/>\non the floor or flat ground, all it can do is shuffle about helplessly<br/>\nand, no doubt, painfully, until it reaches some slight elevation from<br/>\nwhich it can throw itself into the air. Then, at once, it takes off like<br/>\na flash.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Bumblebee if dropped into an open tumbler will be there until it dies,<br/>\nunless it is taken out. It never sees the means of escape at the top,<br/>\nbut persists in trying to find some way out through the sides near the<br/>\nbottom. It will seek a way where none exists, until it completely<br/>\ndestroys itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn many ways, there are lots of people like the buzzard, the bat and the<br/>\nbee. They are struggling about with all their problems and frustrations,<br/>\nnot realizing that the answer is right there &quot;above&quot; them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67667,"nextTopicId":67616}}
