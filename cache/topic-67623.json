It sounded intimidating until I actually did it.<br/>\nIt&#39;s easier than filing as a homeschooler.  The only drawbacks I can<br/>\nthink of are that we aren&#39;t counted as homeschoolers and we cannot<br/>\nparticipate in any public school activities, which is an issue for some<br/>\npeople but not for us.
