Or some lamo quiz that they just thought of just because they wanted to <br/>\nsee if the children were paying attention in class. This is not right! Just <br/>\nbecause someone fails doesn&#39;t mean that there is something wrong with them, <br/>\nit merely means that the teacher needs to find a way to interest the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes me mad when parents send their children to school and have no clue <br/>\nas to what the child is doing and then all of a sudden when the child begins <br/>\nto fail a test or some other form of record for achievement they want to blow <br/>\ntheir tops.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so grateful for this group.
