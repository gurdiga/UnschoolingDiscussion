He has musical<br/>\nintelligence (he plays guitar in a ska-punk band and writes all their songs),<br/>\ntest-score intelligence (1420 on the SATs w/out studying at all), computer<br/>\nintelligence (started writing manuals for computer games for money when he was<br/>\n14), he&#39;s a good writer (had a chapter of a book published when he was 16, and<br/>\nthat chapter (and only that chapter) was reprinted in a natl games magazine),<br/>\netc, etc, etc... <br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t want to go to college. He&#39;s working at a job he absolutely adores,<br/>\nhe has his own apt. and an active life here, plus his band of course. There&#39;s<br/>\nno way he&#39;d wanna leave, and he doesn&#39;t have TIME! He&#39;s doing great, but<br/>\npeople always freak out and talk about how his talents are being &quot;wasted&quot; --<br/>\nimagine that, he&#39;s wasting his talents by using them in living his life!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I actually do want to go to college. Always have, not because of pushing<br/>\nfrom my family or anything like that, but because I think the college<br/>\nenvironment is one I would absolutely adore -- especially at the specific<br/>\ncolleges I like, all but one of which are itsy bitsy liberal arts colleges. <br/>\n-- <br/>\n...Summer... <br/>\ni.want.candy<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bga.com/~melissab\">http://www.bga.com/~melissab</a><br/>\n(hasn&#39;t been updated, changing soon) <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;On with dance, let joy be unconfined, is my motto; whether there&#39;s any dance<br/>\nto dance or any joy to unconfined.&quot;<br/>\n-Mark Twain</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":424,"nextTopicId":567}}
