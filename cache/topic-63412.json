We have our web site and we are pow wow traders. That means we have lots of stock. Here - in the house. We also have a 15 month old Black Lab mix. To say she&#39;s hyper is an understatement. She&#39;s a great dog, but we haven&#39;t been able to stop her from pulling hard when we walk her. She also jumps on people. (She&#39;s knocked folks down!!)I have a chronic back condition. As much as I want, I cannot work with the dog as much as she needs. Brianna always says she will. She does. For a couple of days. Then  - Nothing.<br/>\nI can&#39;t walk the dog because she pulls so hard. She actually caused me great pain.<br/>\nBrianna is great with the dog - yet loses interest. Pow wow season is coming. We&#39;ll be out at powwows and I&#39;ll not have any choice but to leave our dog tied up by our tent. Away from people - away from our store tent. Then she&#39;ll bark.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrianna & I have talked about this. I can&#39;t keep this dog for the next ten years (or so) if she isn&#39;t going to be trained.<br/>\nI have a video that we&#39;ve watched - again, Brianna doesn&#39;t do the work. I simply cannot.<br/>\nI&#39;ve purchased a couple of books and magazines about this. We&#39;ve looked into training (cheapest price - $400.00 )<br/>\nWe can&#39;t afford that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate to give her an ultimatum - &quot;train this dog or she&#39;s gone!&quot;<br/>\nI hate to yell about - altho when I was pulled over - I sure did yell!<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions??<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63519,"nextTopicId":63940}}
