I try to see it from their perspective<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n&gt; I was so relieved that they had at least made one friend at the conference<br/>\n&gt; and that they seemed to have formed a connection.  They seem to really<br/>\nneed<br/>\n&gt; a connection to other children to really feel relaxed and enjoy them.<br/>\n(Guess<br/>\n&gt; I do too.)  When they feel this connection, they are very generous and<br/>\n&gt; trusting.  Dd2 bought her new friend a candy bar with her own money while<br/>\nwe<br/>\n&gt; were at the conference.  She can be so sweet.  The candy bar cost half of<br/>\n&gt; her weekly allowance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When your dd approached the girls, it was the last day of the conference,<br/>\n&gt; after having their things taken a few times without being asked and after<br/>\n&gt; spending two days feeling overwhelmed by having so many children approach<br/>\n&gt; them repeatedly to play with them or to ask to play with their things.  By<br/>\n&gt; that point, they just wanted to be left alone.  This doesn&#39;t mean that not<br/>\n&gt; considering another child&#39;s feelings is ok, but might help to explain why<br/>\n&gt; they didn&#39;t show more compassion at that point.  They are still young too<br/>\n&gt; (almost 8 and 9.5) and still learning how to politely show people where<br/>\n&gt; their boundaries are.  I do encourage my kids to let people know where<br/>\ntheir<br/>\n&gt; boundaries are.  If they are uncomfortable in a situation, it&#39;s important<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; be able to say so.  (I&#39;m thinking long term, here...being able to say no,<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t want to play with another child (gently) might lead up to being<br/>\n&gt; able to say no to a strange adult who tries to lure them into a car.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do encourage my children to share, but I don&#39;t force it.

I have to work with my children&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; personalities though in trying to impart a sharing attitude and from just<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; own two children, I already know that generosity with things and the value<br/>\n&gt; of things is different from child to child.  One of my girls just listed<br/>\n&gt; some toys she doesn&#39;t want anymore on ebay.  (so she can save for another<br/>\n&gt; Breyer horse.)  The other one wouldn&#39;t ever part with anything that was<br/>\n&gt; given to her, ever.  She knows who gave it to her and when, all the way<br/>\nback<br/>\n&gt; to when she was two.  Her things have a value to them that even I can&#39;t<br/>\nsee.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t understand it, but I respect her choice to keep her things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve tried group things over and over again.  My kids just don&#39;t enjoy<br/>\n&gt; group things.  They never relax and be themselves.  We were in a play<br/>\ngroup<br/>\n&gt; weekly for 6 months (when the kids were 4 and 6) with 10 children and they<br/>\n&gt; still couldn&#39;t relax and enjoy themselves.  We went to Sunday school from<br/>\n&gt; the time they were 1 and 3 till they were probably 5 and 7 and they still<br/>\n&gt; never felt at home there. They are insulted when people cut in line.  They<br/>\n&gt; are insulted when people push and shove.  They are insulted when people<br/>\n&gt; (adults or kids) push them to interact when they aren&#39;t ready.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When someone cuts in line in front of them or plows by them knocking them<br/>\n&gt; out of the way, they always ask me why.  Why didn&#39;t they see me?  Why<br/>\ndidn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; they just ask me to move?  Why didn&#39;t they get in line behind me?  I try<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; explain it, (maybe they were so excited about X that they looked right<br/>\n&gt; through you) but I am often at a loss to explain other children&#39;s<br/>\nbehaviors.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s harder for extroverted people to understand introverted<br/>\npeople<br/>\n&gt; than it is for introverted people to understand extroverted people.

Her things have a value to them that even I can&#39;t see.<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand it, but I respect her choice to keep her things.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;ve tried group things over and over again.  My kids just don&#39;t enjoy<br/>\ngroup things.  They never relax and be themselves.  We were in a play group<br/>\nweekly for 6 months (when the kids were 4 and 6) with 10 children and they<br/>\nstill couldn&#39;t relax and enjoy themselves.  We went to Sunday school from<br/>\nthe time they were 1 and 3 till they were probably 5 and 7 and they still<br/>\nnever felt at home there. They are insulted when people cut in line.  They<br/>\nare insulted when people push and shove.  They are insulted when people<br/>\n(adults or kids) push them to interact when they aren&#39;t ready.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen someone cuts in line in front of them or plows by them knocking them<br/>\nout of the way, they always ask me why.  Why didn&#39;t they see me?  Why didn&#39;t<br/>\nthey just ask me to move?  Why didn&#39;t they get in line behind me?  I try to<br/>\nexplain it, (maybe they were so excited about X that they looked right<br/>\nthrough you) but I am often at a loss to explain other children&#39;s behaviors.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nI think it&#39;s harder for extroverted people to understand introverted people<br/>\nthan it is for introverted people to understand extroverted people.  We can<br/>\nunderstand why it hurts for someone to feel left out.  But it seems like<br/>\nit&#39;s hard for some people to understand why some people prefer to play one<br/>\non one.<br/>\n <br/>\nJust some thoughts.<br/>\n <br/>\nAngela <br/>\n &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a>&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":88821644,"authorName":"christy austin","from":"christy austin &lt;romance9398@...&gt;","profile":"romance9398","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Where does compassion come into play? was Digest Number 4905","postDate":"1094135867","msgId":98989,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwOTAyMTQzNzQ3Ljk2MjEucW1haWxAd2ViNTE2MDQubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGNmLjE1YTUxZjQwLjJlNjg3YThkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":98986,"nextInTopic":98991,"prevInTime":98988,"nextInTime":98990,"topicId":98986,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But I have to ask,<br/>\nwhere does compassion come into play here?  I am<br/>\nprobably going to really catch it from some of you,<br/>\nbut I see so much selfishness in some of this.  My son<br/>\nis 10 and we have always encouraged him to share.  I<br/>\nwon&#39;t say that we forced him but it was always<br/>\nsomething that he knew we expected.  I have seen him<br/>\ndevelop such compassion for other kids, especially<br/>\nyounger ones.  Maybe it is because I have always come<br/>\nat it from the other kids perspective.  Asked him to<br/>\nput himself in their place.  We don&#39;t have alot of<br/>\nmoney, never have.  That has been an amazing blessing<br/>\nbecause he doesn&#39;t put too much value on &quot;things&quot;.  He<br/>\nputs his value on people and relationships.  He went<br/>\nto the skate park Monday and he joyfully shared the<br/>\namazing, mongoose bike that one of the teens at our<br/>\nchurch had built for himself and gave to Joshua.  I<br/>\nlove to see how giving he is and the joy he gets from<br/>\nsharing.  He does have some things he collects that he<br/>\nkeeps up and doesn&#39;t play with himself because he<br/>\nwants them to stay nice. So I do understand that part.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI kept a little boy this summer who is not a sharer. <br/>\nAnd I know his mom has tried to teach him this.  He<br/>\ncame expecting to share all of Joshua&#39;s things but<br/>\nwould bring things that Joshua &quot;couldn&#39;t&quot; play with. <br/>\nIt gave me a chance to discuss with Joshua how this<br/>\nmade him feel.  We are trying to teach him the value<br/>\nof having a servants heart and in giving other people<br/>\njoy.  And yes, this does go along with my chrisian<br/>\nbeliefs.  But christian or not is that not a desirable<br/>\ntrait to teach a child?  We take joy is sharing and<br/>\ngiving to others.  He wouldn&#39;t have blinked twice at<br/>\nsharing with a 4 yr. old (even a girl) and probably<br/>\nwould have asked her before she could ask.  He would<br/>\nhave asked because he didn&#39;t want to cause her pain. <br/>\n<br/>\nAm I wrong because I want him to be a compassionate<br/>\nperson?  I don&#39;t see that as breaking his spirit by<br/>\nencouraging him to share. I believe that he is partly<br/>\nthe person he is because of the stand we have taken. <br/>\nAm I misunderstanding the motive behind the not<br/>\nsharing thing?  Sorry if I anger some of you.  I am<br/>\njust really trying to understand here.  And I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink hurting people is ever a good thing.

She watched quietly for a few then asked to play. I watched as one <br/>\nof the girls kept her hand on the horse closest to Cassidy. After a couple <br/>\nminutes the girls mentioned something about the elevator which my 4 yr. old picked <br/>\nup on and then excitedly asked if she could go too. I felt so upset that she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t understand that the girls wanted to play alone. I thought what do I <br/>\ntell her? How can I say this?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only other one on one experience with her not being able to play with two <br/>\ngirls was one time at the playground about a month ago. There were two girls <br/>\nabout a year or so older than she. They said to her your fat you cant play, <br/>\nthese are my monkey bars you cant use them, im prettier than you and I have more <br/>\nfriends than you do. <br/>\nMy daughter doesn&#39;t understand when others dont want to play or they comment <br/>\nlike the girls at the playground did. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the conference I told her that they wanted to play alone. She persisted <br/>\nabout taking the elevator so she could play with them. I explained the best I <br/>\ncould without harming her spirit. In the end she knows that she doesn&#39;t like to <br/>\nshare with her brother all the time so she understood. We later took a trip to <br/>\nthe top floor and back down again so was just fine with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the horses they are expensive. I would guess that a lot of the kids <br/>\ndont know the difference between the cheap ones and the real ones. But even if <br/>\nthere were cheaper ones to offer I wonder if that would have still been a <br/>\nconcern. The girls I saw defiantly were older than my daughter so I dont know if it <br/>\nwas a bond she would have been able to join in cheap horse or not. I guess it <br/>\ncould be similar to a group playing video games or Yugio(sp) cards with an <br/>\napproaching toddler.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess in the end from my perspective im glad that she isn&#39;t afraid to ask <br/>\nto play or assume that she can. I think lots of kids have that free spirit <br/>\ntaken away and wont even approach other kids out of fear of rejection. On the <br/>\nother side that leaves kids like the horse playing girls open to having to say <br/>\nwe&#39;d like to play alone. <br/>\nIn the end I do hope the girls were able to have fun and continue their play.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura~Maine who is trying to stay out of the teaching a 3yr old calculus <br/>\nconversation on the local list (grumble, grumble, roar!) <br/>\nP.S it was great to finally meet you Saturday. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99019,"nextTopicId":99040}}
