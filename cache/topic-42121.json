It does take school teachers longer than others to<br/>\nrealize that schoolwork is not education....it&#39;s just schoolwork. Someday,<br/>\nyour parents will get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son also did what your brother did -- dropped out (on my recommendation)<br/>\nand learned guitar, on his own, well enough to get into the LA Conservatory<br/>\nof Music and play lead guitar in a band. His own company now makes sound<br/>\ntracks for commercials when his new band is not working.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool, of course, never encouraged him to do any of the things he liked or<br/>\nwas good at. Schools are excellent at pointing out what children are not<br/>\ngood at or interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42119,"nextTopicId":42142}}
