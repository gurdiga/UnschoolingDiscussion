It long has been regarded as <br/>\nenvironmentally &quot;safe,&quot; since the process typically uses no ozone-depleting <br/>\nchemicals, and demands one-fourth as much energy as refrigeration during the <br/>\npeak cooling months of the year. In dry climates, evaporative cooling, even <br/>\nthe relatively inefficient &quot;swamp box&quot; household cooler, can be used to <br/>\ninexpensively cool large homes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDirect evaporative cooling adds moisture to the air. In wet climates, or <br/>\nduring the late summer rainy season in the desert, this results in <br/>\nuncomfortable and, for many individuals, unacceptable indoor humidity. In <br/>\nPhoenix, those who have the option to choose between evaporative cooling and <br/>\nrefrigeration usually switch systems during July and do not go back to <br/>\nevaporative cooling until mid-September. Indirect evaporative cooling, <br/>\nwithout added humidity, is less effective, costs more, and if not used <br/>\nproperly, can cause damage to refrigeration systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most common form of residential evaporative cooling uses a vertical pad <br/>\nof cellulose fiber, a system for delivering water to the top of the pad, and <br/>\na fan to draw air through the porous pad as the water runs down the medium <br/>\nand is absorbed. As dry air moves over the wet pad, water evaporates, and the <br/>\nair gives up its heat. The air moving from the wet pad into the home is <br/>\ncooler than the outdoor air. Where water is high in mineral content, a <br/>\nbleed-off system often is used on the water circulation system, constantly <br/>\ndumping part of the water and allowing the refill valve to replace it with <br/>\nfresh water. This decreases the mineral build-up on the pads and on the <br/>\ninside of the cooler, but at a 25 to 50 percent increase in water use.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe drop in temperature depends on how much water the air can absorb (a <br/>\nfunction of the relative humidity), how evenly the pad media is wetted, and <br/>\nhow long the air is exposed to the pad (a factor of turbulence, wetness, and <br/>\nspeed of air movement), the evaporability of the water (both temperature and <br/>\nhardness of the water affect this), and the ability of the building to &quot;vent&quot; <br/>\nwarmer exhaust air back to the atmosphere.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is general agreement, even among domestic manufacturers, that U.S.-made <br/>\nevaporative coolers are not as energy- or water-efficient as they could be. <br/>\nThese products are targeted heavily to middle-, lower-middle-, and low-income <br/>\nhouseholds, and appear to be designed against a one- to two-year capital <br/>\npayback, rather than optimum operational efficiency. Operating savings in <br/>\nboth water and energy, as well as in maintenance costs, often fall victim to <br/>\nproduction of price-competitive units.<br/>\n<br/>\nInefficiencies in less expensive units include: under-powered, inexpensive <br/>\naluminum-wound fan motors rather than more energy-efficient, larger <br/>\ncopper-wound motors; recirculating pumps that run faster and hotter than <br/>\nnecessary to compensate for a lack of volume capacity; fans that run up to 20 <br/>\npercent over design capacity to move larger volumes of air at increased <br/>\nvelocity to make up in wind movement what is lost in evaporative efficiency. <br/>\n<br/>\nSlower movement of air through a thicker pad medium, adequately wetted by a <br/>\nproperly sized pump, all contained within a high-reflectivity cabinet, and <br/>\nwith all components operating at voltages higher than the usual household <br/>\ncurrent, would result in energy and water savings as well as a longer-lived <br/>\ncooler and a more cost-effective long-term investment.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38446,"nextTopicId":38474}}
