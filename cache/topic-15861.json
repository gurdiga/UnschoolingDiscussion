Often on other lists I \nonly fit in, in a narrow, confined way.&nbsp; But on this list I&#39;ve found people \nwho can discuss philosphy, spirituality, politics, ecology, family bed, extended \nbreastfeeding, media, and on &amp; on....topics I am interested in, topics where \nI enjoy learning of different ideas, and different opinions.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Sometimes I have little interest in a specific \nthread, sometimes I disagree with stated opinions, but overall I feel a sense \nthat I fit in here, and for that I am very thankful!&nbsp; For instance I am no \nlonger interested in breastfeeding info, don&#39;t plan on doing that again, but I \nwas thrilled to find a group that embraces that, as I did, even though I may \nskim or delete such posts if I&#39;m in a hurry, I would never want them to \nstop.&nbsp; I enjoyed the fact that people were discussing it even if I didn&#39;t \njoin in.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">The funny thing is that similar heated discussions \n(religion, abortion) have appeared on 2 other lists I am on this week.&nbsp; I \nknow that this stuff springs up on many lists from time to time, but there seems \nto be a heatedness lately, I&#39;ve wondered if it isn&#39;t related to our new \npolitical climate.&nbsp; At a time when certain religious views seem to be \nforced on us, when the government is putting on such a conservative face,when \nthe presidential election was&nbsp;decided in the manner that it was, \nwell&nbsp;it seems to be stirring up a lot of anger, &amp; resentment.&nbsp; So \nto refuse to look at these feelings would be akin to sticking our heads in the \nsand, and refusing to see the world around us, and that wouldn&#39;t be unschooling \nlike at all.&nbsp; At least in my opinion.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Cindy L.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Unschooling.com","from":"&quot;Unschooling.com&quot; &lt;LisaBugg@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"nydCUKcViKnUmagRYZdy8RssVDOjJT1ZYP4j5zWCNEUCaLrqPOKJJR-yHe069nA6mp7yubLIh0XTfnYTeNx6E7P_EFpSJiYR8rJAa77p0VELISM","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Content of this list!","postDate":"981222511","msgId":15864,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMTUwMWMwOGUwOSQ4Njg4NDAyMCQ0NjFjOTNhOEBpZm5ldC5lZHU+","referencesHeader":"PDAwNWUwMWMwOGUyMiRkNTQ1NjEyMCQ0MTAyMTdkMUB1bmRlcndkPg=="},"prevInTopic":15861,"nextInTopic":15871,"prevInTime":15863,"nextInTime":15865,"topicId":15861,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"C, This list has ~400 people listening, reading and talking.

What interests<br/>\nthe folks who are participating are the topics we persue.  We are a wildly<br/>\ndiverisfied list and have some great conversations.  The easiest way to<br/>\nshift the topic to what you are interested in is to just start talking.  Ask<br/>\nquestions or tell your stories.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the conversations that do not interest you, maybe you can delete by<br/>\nsubject line? Or if you read at the website you can read by subject line and<br/>\nnever have the mail come directly to your mailbox. This saves having to wade<br/>\nthrough all the email.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re a rather independent bunch, and just as soon as we made one topic<br/>\nofflimits, we&#39;d spend weeks on censorship and draconian practices. &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>\nWe really do try to stay on a topic though, and not move into the realm of<br/>\npersonal attacks.  We succeed there for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how is unschooling going at your house?<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;C,N,+R Underwood&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:underwd@...\">underwd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, February 03, 2001 2:48 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Content of this list!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI joined this list in hopes of having conversations about different things<br/>\npeople were doing with their kids to have fun while learning at the same<br/>\ntime.
