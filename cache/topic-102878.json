You could use the whole &#39;voting&#39; thing<br/>\nto talk about democracy and how in a democracy<br/>\nmajority rules, but that doesn&#39;t mean that everyone<br/>\nwill be happy with the result and is this &#39;fair&#39;, or<br/>\nwhat have you.

The kids say a little poem: We <br/>\nlight this candle to celebrate Unitarian Universalism; this is the <br/>\nchurch of the open mind, this is the church of the loving heart, this is <br/>\nthe church of the helping hands, this is the world of which we&#39;re all <br/>\npart.  Our symbol, the flaming chalice, came about during WWII, so our <br/>\nservice groups in Europe could be identified by people in need. <br/>\nThis said, unschooling (homeschooling at all, for that matter) is not <br/>\nautomatically understood nor accepted by everyone of this faith... The <br/>\ndemocratic process is an important aspect of our principles, some feel <br/>\nwe are removing ourselves from the process by removing our children from <br/>\nstate-provided education.  (Very funny that last year&#39;s L&L conference <br/>\nwas held in the city named for the UU family who firmly established <br/>\ninstitutional education for all American children)<br/>\nAs a religion, we are just exploring ways to support our homeschooling <br/>\nmembers.  Last year, there was an article about time together as a <br/>\nfamily, in our UU World Magazine... the author made some nasty remark <br/>\nabout homeschoolers and their &quot;family beds and macrobiotic diets,&quot; which <br/>\ncaused a big stir including letters from homeschoolers who presented <br/>\ntheir lifestyles as a means to have more family time.  This was quickly <br/>\nfollowed with an article about the &quot;newly-discovered&quot; UU Homeschoolers <br/>\n(and the token &quot;it didn&#39;t work for us&quot; family). <br/>\nIt&#39;s an exciting time to be involved in this church... a growing, <br/>\nthriving, unafraid of change establishment!  (It was the teen youth <br/>\ngroups  from the Unitarian and Universalism Churches, in the 60s, who <br/>\nbegan the process of combining both religions into one -- children are <br/>\ngiven their vote at age 12, when they voluntarily sign the membership book)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We read Bible stories and read his actual Bible.

I <br/>\nlike it for the most part. I love the CUUPS group here and am active <br/>\nwith them. (That&#39;s the pagan group for those that wouldn&#39;t know that)<br/>\nI like the RE classes here, (religious ed) the thing I like the best <br/>\nabout them is that the kids are being exposed to what different <br/>\ngroups of people believe without being told, &quot;this is the one true <br/>\nway&quot; while learning about those beliefs. My son&#39;s class is learning <br/>\nabout Jewish holidays and beliefs(K-1 age group) and my daughters is <br/>\nlearning about different types of eco systems and how animals live <br/>\nin different parts of the world. <br/>\nLast week the &quot;sermon&quot; was on evolution. Not about how it was wrong, <br/>\nbut about how it makes sense. I was able to buy a couple of books <br/>\nfrom these people for the kids. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.earthethics.com/born_with_a_bang.htm\">http://www.earthethics.com/born_with_a_bang.htm</a> was one of the books.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thegreatstory.org/K-12programs.html\">http://www.thegreatstory.org/K-12programs.html</a><br/>\nthese were the people that came and did a sermon as well as a <br/>\nseminar that I really enjoyed on the subject. <br/>\nI didn&#39;t agree with everything they had to say, but it was certainly <br/>\nrefreshing to hear someone speak on the subject without ignoring a <br/>\nlot of scientific stuff that points to evolution. <br/>\nANyway, I&#39;m rambling. If you want my take on UU&#39;s in more detail, <br/>\nlet me know. Probably ought to take this one off list.<br/>\nNisha </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":172750465,"authorName":"b229d655@cs.com","from":"b229d655@...","profile":"robeyboyz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] OT, a little.
