He grew up in a home with lots of food restrictions, the &quot;only health food&quot; model I&#39;ve been letting go of myself, and has struggled with his weight his entire adult life. He said he felt unsupported in his own home as I have been bringing in and offering more foods to my kids, including candy. He said he is unable to regulate, and the way he has always handled that was to not have those things in his home. It was probably not helpful in the moment, but I did point out that that strategy had not been particularly successful in terms of weight loss in the 11 years that I have known him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI asked him if I could present this quandary to this community, how to be supportive of my husband while still providing abundance and variety for my kids.
