My 12 yo dd and dh are true outside the box thinkers.  My dd some times is way out there :-)  I am so inside the box it makes me mad.  Here is an embarrassing example:  I wanted to write better thank you notes so I had to go and get a book on it.  I always have to follow instructions or see an example first.  No free thinking here!  Maybe I&#39;ll get better at it the longer we unschool.  Hope so.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Sarah Carothers <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Monday, January 07, 2002 10:34 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: [a moment&#39;s peace<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello again Pat,<br/>\nThink of it like a commune. Everybody has freedoms but you also have to<br/>\nrespect your fellow munies :-) (is that a word?)  If you are used to the<br/>\nkids being in bed at, say 10, then what you do now is tell them that they do<br/>\nnot have to adhere to a certain bedtime *but* they still have to respect<br/>\nyour privacy and your need for quiet time.  This has nothing to do with<br/>\nunschooling.. it has to do with them learning how to live under the same<br/>\nroof with others. <br/>\nIf it&#39;s quiet time you need, tell the kids that at 10:00, you plan on blah<br/>\nblah blahing (reading?) and they are free to do something quietly in their<br/>\nrooms or in the basement. If they choose not to, then *you* might just have<br/>\nto choose to get up at 6a.m, playing that army wake-up call &lt;g&gt; and show<br/>\nthem what disrespect for others&#39; needs feels like.  I mean, tell them once<br/>\nwhat is expected of them. If they don&#39;t do whatever it is, don&#39;t nag.. just<br/>\nshow them how it feels if the shoe were on the other foot.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re coming along great, Pat. Just think outside the box ;-)!<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Carothers<br/>\n       ~oo~<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a><br/>\nAfter giving my children the freedom to decide their own bedtime a few days<br/>\nago, I am beginning to miss my few hours of quiet time.
