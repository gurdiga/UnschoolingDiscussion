We may never know the good that comes from<br/>\ndiscussing such topics, it would be a shame to discourage people from asking<br/>\nquestions.  There is the idea that when one person in a group asks a<br/>\nquestion they are speaking for others in the group too.  This discussion<br/>\ndoes not have to be about changing minds, but instead it could be seen as an<br/>\nopportunity to exchange ideas, to throw out our own stories that might aid<br/>\nsomeone else.  It has been mentioned that some parents who were raised with<br/>\ncorporal punishment are looking for ideas to help them avoid repeating the<br/>\npast.  Certainly I have never changed my mind or learned anything by being<br/>\nreprimanded or scolded, so I don&#39;t think this is an effective way to get a<br/>\npoint across.<br/>\n<br/>\nI for one don&#39;t believe in &#39;punishment&#39; in any form as a device for teaching<br/>\nchildren (or adults for that matter), but due to my history I have a nasty<br/>\ntemper, my parents rarely hit us but there was emotional violence, and lots<br/>\nof throwing objects and such.  So even though I have come to terms with all<br/>\nof this, and I have found a philosophy that I try to live by, I am not<br/>\nperfect.  Heaven knows I can use reminders of helpful hints from time to<br/>\ntime.  The best idea I&#39;ve found is singing- it calms myself and my son.  But<br/>\nit&#39;s helpful to be reminded when I&#39;m not thinking clear.  My husband on the<br/>\nother hand grew up in a family where voices were never raised, emotions<br/>\nnever shown either, so when I forget and start to scream he gets quite<br/>\nupset.  But it never helps if he  criticizes me at this point, if instead he<br/>\ntries to understand, or if he would gently start to sing I could calm down,<br/>\nthis is what I want to do after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it seems that Corallyn wanted ideas that she could use to avoid a<br/>\nsituation she was uncomfortable with, and some people did answer with<br/>\ncompassion  for her intent, that can help.  Continuing to back her into a<br/>\ncorner can never accomplish anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very new to this list, but this seemed very important to me- the idea<br/>\nof approaching a situation in a loving helpful manner, rather than creating<br/>\nill feelings & defensiveness, so that everyone feels safe to seek help &<br/>\nadvice about any matters that may ultimately benefit their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy L.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Shirley A Richardson-McCourt&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thediva@...\">thediva@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 05, 2000 2:00 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: General observation<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We seem to have a few folks who don&#39;t deal very well with the concept that<br/>\n&gt; some people will NEVER agree with them and that they are entitled to think<br/>\n&gt; whatever they like.
