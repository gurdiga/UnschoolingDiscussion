We","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-451605867\">I just have to share this -- I am so excited.  I know you all must have a<br/>\nzillion stories like this, but whenever it happens I feel so relieved and<br/>\nrevived.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been somewhat homeschoolers I guess from the beginning.  I came<br/>\nalong kicking and screaming with curriculum and workbooks flailing around<br/>\nwildly.  But my kids (who just kept coming too -- we have 5 with the<br/>\nyoungest being 2 year old twins) just kept glaring at me when I would sit<br/>\ndown and announce that school had begun for the day.  My oldest has done<br/>\nSaxon math for a year now and I have been thrilled that we had some &quot;proof&quot;<br/>\nthat he is being educated.  This whole approach has always seemed terribly<br/>\nwrong to me, but I have this PTA mom persona who keeps lurking around in my<br/>\nbrain so I just didn&#39;t want to be that different.  Well, my wonderful sister<br/>\njust moved here not too long ago and, by her presence, has convinced me that<br/>\nwhat is in my soul is right.  SO, I have been relaxing and realizing that<br/>\nthey really DO want to learn and that they WILL learn all on their own<br/>\nwithout me announcing that they will now learn something.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, today, we got home from a great day and my 4 and 6 year olds started<br/>\ntalking about their hearts.  So I yanked out the book about the body on the<br/>\nshelf that had great overlays of the body and showed them to the kids.  Then<br/>\nwe read the whole book together and talked all about the body&#39;s systems.<br/>\nThen my 6 year old went off to the kitchen to draw her heart while my son<br/>\ntried skipping around on one foot to feel what balance is, then he tried<br/>\nbiting his hand until his brain sent his hand the message to pull away (he<br/>\nis a complete scream...).  I sat there glowing in my love for these kids and<br/>\nrealizing that the only way to truly love them is to respect them and to<br/>\nhelp them unfold in their own way and in their own time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is great and has been very helpful to me in breaking some of my<br/>\nPTA-mom personality&#39;s grip on me.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen in NC</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6054,"nextTopicId":5803}}
