First, it s written in that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1125441698\">I&#39;m slogging through the thing I mentioned the other day.  There are  <br/>\nsome really interesting parts, and some frustrating bits.  First,  <br/>\nit&#39;s written in that language used only in college text books and  <br/>\nscholarly &quot;studies.&quot;  It&#39;s not regular English.  It&#39;s a language I  <br/>\nused and read when I was in college, but was glad to leave behind for  <br/>\nreal English.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what&#39;s more interesting to me is that although the researcher did  <br/>\n&quot;get unschooling&quot; better than many people who come to it as a  <br/>\nreporter or a researcher, the things she didn&#39;t get are telling too.   <br/>\nBecause she worked hard to try to understand, it&#39;s interesting to see  <br/>\nwhat is so hard to grasp.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t cut and paste from it because it&#39;s a PDF, but I want to  <br/>\ntranscribe a bit of it.  Page 74, in the first of five studies, about  <br/>\na boy who started liking opera when he was six, and goes to yard  <br/>\nsales and asks for opera records.  He&#39;s 11 and his brother&#39;s seven,  <br/>\nin this part of the account.  First the research quotes the mom and  <br/>\nthen comments.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; &#39; The operas [Peter] chose [to rent on DVD] were the ones he  <br/>\nthought would also appeal to our younger son, Richard,&#39; Mary  <br/>\nremarked.  Clearly, Peter hopes to cultivate another opera fan in the  <br/>\nhousehold, another person to share his interest and enthusiasm.   <br/>\nPeter also attempts to initiate his younger brother into the practice  <br/>\nof becoming an opera fan. Mary&#39;s family engages in the social  <br/>\npractice of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The way unschoolers access media resources and people underscores  <br/>\nthe importance they place on authenticity.  When unschoolers re- <br/>\nconceptualize the world around them, they see an abundance of real- <br/>\nlife resources. ...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo although she&#39;s kinda getting it, and doing her best to help the  <br/>\nacademics who will read her paper get it, it amounts to stilted  <br/>\nnonsense on another level.<br/>\nI know from these sorts of things with my own family that it doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nneed to even begin to be about &quot;cultivating&quot; or &quot;initiating.&quot;  It&#39;s  <br/>\nabout  saying &quot;Listen!  This is cool!&quot;  and if the person says &quot;wow&quot;  <br/>\nthat&#39;s great and if they say &quot;Not now,&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t like it,&quot; that&#39;s  <br/>\ngreat too.  Within the analytical construct (see?  Those phrases  <br/>\nbeget more of themselves, damn it) above, if Richard doesn&#39;t like  <br/>\nopera, then Peter has failed to cultivate; he has suffered   <br/>\ninitiation failure which would seem to show a faulty cultivation  <br/>\nmethodology.   It&#39;s just too much structure.  It&#39;s a false structure  <br/>\nover a lack of structure. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd &quot;the practice of becoming an opera fan&quot; jars in the light of  <br/>\nunschooling too.  There was a REAL becoming there, not a plan of  <br/>\naction after which (if one&#39;s practice proved sound) one would be a   <br/>\ncertifiable or completed opera fan.  And the family is NOT &quot;engaging  <br/>\nin the social practice of learning.&quot;  That scaffolding can be  <br/>\nremoved.  Mary&#39;s family learns for fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven all that, the fact that the next paragraph talks about  <br/>\n&quot;authenticity&quot; is kinda cute!   &quot;When unschoolers re-conceptualize  <br/>\nthe world...&quot;   WHOA!    Those of us who were interviewed failed in  <br/>\nour attempt to initiate this researcher into the practice of becoming  <br/>\nsomeone who understands unschooling.  If anyone has &quot;re- <br/>\nconceptualized the world,&quot; it&#39;s academia, which defines things in  <br/>\nterms of what helps with school success, and comes up with words like  <br/>\n&quot;extracurricular&quot; and &quot;co-ed&quot; and &quot;screentime&quot; and &quot;chapter book&quot; and  <br/>\nuses them outside the bounds of school as though they still  make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad the project was done, and I&#39;m really glad to be able to read  <br/>\nit, but I&#39;m sorry that the semester ended and so it was written up to  <br/>\nmatch the calendar, regardless of whether the work of understanding  <br/>\nit well enough to analyze it was really finished.  The end-of-session  <br/>\nbell rang.  Summer vacation.  No more learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n================================In case anyone&#39;s  <br/>\ninterested...===================<br/>\nUnschooling Media:<br/>\nParticipatory Practices among Progressive Homeschoolers<br/>\nBy<br/>\nVanessa Bertozzi<br/>\nMaster’s of Science Thesis in Comparative Media Studies<br/>\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology<br/>\nMay 12, 2006<br/>\n<br/>\nThis took a while to load on my computer:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vanessabertozzi.com/unschooling_media.pdf\">http://www.vanessabertozzi.com/unschooling_media.pdf</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"media study on unschoolers","postDate":"1150920049","msgId":26153,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzQTk5RTVCLTdGQUQtNEJERi1CNTI1LTFGRURDNkQ1QjA1OUBTQU5EUkFET0RELkNPTT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26160,"prevInTime":26152,"nextInTime":26154,"topicId":26153,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I know some of thesepeople, but most I don t.
