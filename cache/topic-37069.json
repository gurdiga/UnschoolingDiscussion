I saw a difference in attitude<br/>\nbetween the just started kindergarten children and the 3rd grader.  I left<br/>\nteaching shortly before starting a family. Over the years,  I had time to<br/>\nreflect on the controversy of such frame of mind. I didn&#39;t want my children<br/>\nto be exposed to PS socialisation, especially not before they can reason the<br/>\ndifference between just and unjust behaviours.<br/>\nThe other problem I had with Ps was the way knowledge was delivered. I went<br/>\nto school with an insatiable thirst for knowledge. I felt thirsty, most of<br/>\nthe time, until I finally left schooling as we know it.  I wanted my sons to<br/>\nhave access to any leaning opportunity the minute they wanted such access.<br/>\nLearning from home using the whole world made more sense to me.  When we<br/>\nstarted home schooling, I didn&#39;t want to use the schooling methods in our<br/>\nhome, only some of  the school resource centre.

My girls know lots of stuff abouthistory and science <br/>\nthat I learned sometime in school but forgot right after the test.  <br/>\nThey won&#39;t forget because they learned by seeing it in context or <br/>\nbecause they wanted to or because it was in something else they were <br/>\nworking on and it related.  I think that our schools are so set on <br/>\neveryone learning a set core of stuff that they have forgotten that <br/>\nonce we reach adulthood, we each need different things.  Unschooling <br/>\nallows the mechanics among us to focus on cars and the astronomers to <br/>\nfocus on the stars.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; What do you hope your kids will have gotten from unschooling by the <br/>\ntime<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re ready to move on from home?
