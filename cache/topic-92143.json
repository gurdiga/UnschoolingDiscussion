A food fight can be as<br/>\nsimple as splotching your ice cream cone on their nose (or their ice cream<br/>\ncone as they try to take a bite), throwing a cup of water on them on a hot<br/>\nday when you are drinking (we did this at an ice cream place - our friends<br/>\nactually started the fight with our kids, and we ended up chasing each other<br/>\nwith water from a water fountain in cups for at least two hours, it was<br/>\ngreat and we couldn&#39;t go past that ice cream place without the kids asking<br/>\nto stop and play again).  The surprise is half the fun.  They can&#39;t know<br/>\nthat it&#39;s coming, and hot days with cool liquids are the best IMNSHO.  But<br/>\nif you do want to use actual &quot;food,&quot; you could use veggies cooked soft like<br/>\nthey do in the movies and stuff.  Anyway, enjoy.<br/>\nReatha McCafferty in OH<br/>\n<br/>\nPamela wrote:<br/>\nI am just curious about food fights.
