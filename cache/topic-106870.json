It  seemed <br/>\ncommonly said in those days that cold drinks were unnatural (and even  then <br/>\nthey were more common in the U.S. than in many other places and so they  were <br/>\nlooking for what was our health problem, and that was one of the accused  <br/>\nfactors).   It would keep other foods from digesting right if you  drank a really <br/>\ncold drink (and some people said if you drank ANY drink it kept  the food from <br/>\ndigesting well, and that probably makes some sense, if the stomach  contents <br/>\nare too diluted).  <br/>\n <br/>\nBut as to why cold would keep you awake while warm foods wouldn&#39;t, I found  <br/>\nthis, on an australian dietary rant site probably not worth linking up  <br/>\notherwise.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n*****************<br/>\nToo many icy cold drinks, beer, ice-cream, smoothies, cold salads etc, all  <br/>\nimpair the digestion.<br/>\nWhat we have to remember is, that the digestion relies  on a chemical process <br/>\nof a reaction-taking place to digest our food.<br/>\nOur body  runs on 37degrees Celsius and therefore for any process in our body <br/>\nto take  place it requires this temperature to run at optimum efficiency.<br/>\nTherefore  put a cold piece of fruit straight out of the refrigerator at 5 <br/>\ndegrees Celsius  into the stomach. This cold piece of food then lowers the temp <br/>\nin the stomach.  The stomach then has to try and bring this cold substance up <br/>\nto 37 degrees for  digestion to take place. This requires more acid, which in <br/>\nturn requires more  mucus to be made to protect the stomach lining. It also <br/>\nrequires alot more  energy.<br/>\nMore acid, more mucus and we get fluid build up and bloating taking  place <br/>\nand a lot of energy being taken for this one piece of fruit. Do this over  a <br/>\nlifetime and you are literally using up most of your energy just to digest  your <br/>\nfood. Also the digestion is impaired from all the extra work it has to  do.<br/>\n****************<br/>\n <br/>\nSo your body has to wake up and work hard (your heart will beat faster,  <br/>\nwhich isn&#39;t good for sleeping) if you&#39;re trying to warm up your  insides.   In the <br/>\nmiddle of a hot day, it can be GREAT (feeling  anyway, maybe not for <br/>\ndigestion) to get that rush of alertness.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe if we all drank room -temperature beer and soda as a lot of  Europe <br/>\ndoes, we&#39;d be not so unhealthy.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe not.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut for sleeping, drinking something your own body temperature or higher  <br/>\n(not hot coffee &lt;g&gt;) would maybe lower your heartbeat.     Other things will <br/>\nlower heartbeat too, though--meditation/prayer/yoga, peaceful  music, reading, <br/>\nrocking a baby to sleep...<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106884,"nextTopicId":1277}}
