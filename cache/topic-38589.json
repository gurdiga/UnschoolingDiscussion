I&#39;ve been involved in early childhood ed for the past 10 years. <br/>\n The first two I worked for a parks and rec dept. as a children&#39;s <br/>\nprogram instructor and coordinator.  When we moved to Virginia 8 years <br/>\nago, I began my family child care business.  I enjoy the freedom of <br/>\nsetting up and running my own program, plus it allows me to be at home <br/>\nwith my two children.<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy,  I saw your post about the disappointing homeschooling <br/>\nconference.  I helped organize the VHEA conference that Alaura referred <br/>\nto on the unschooling list.  VHEA is inclusive though  I think most <br/>\npeople who are involved with VHEA are either eclectic, relaxed, or <br/>\ncompletely unschool.  There are some who are more structured, but the <br/>\nstructured folks I&#39;ve met at VHEA seem less rigid than the hs&#39;ers I&#39;ve <br/>\nmet who go to the HEAV conference.  (How&#39;s that for a sweeping <br/>\ngeneralization?) <br/>\n<br/>\nThe South Carolina conference looks like a lot of fun -- and very <br/>\nwell-organized too, Kelly.  I can see all the work you&#39;ve put into it <br/>\njust by looking at the website.  Perhaps the finance fairy will pay me <br/>\nbeneficial visit so we can attend.  (We&#39;ve already blown our conference <br/>\nattendance budget for the year.)  <br/>\n <br/>\nOne friend of mine referred to unschooling as a spectrum -- and we&#39;re <br/>\nall at various stages along the spectrum.  It seems eclectic is the <br/>\ncatch-all category.  I&#39;ve met many structured homeschoolers who want to <br/>\nexplore unschooling, yet they can&#39;t plunge right in.  They need to <br/>\n&quot;relax&quot; first.  After they&#39;ve &quot;relaxed&quot; they tend to reach for <br/>\n&quot;eclectic.&quot;   The evolution is complete with unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I&#39;m not so sure if I&#39;m as much an unschooler as I am as much <br/>\none who is still in the process of deschooling.  (My son deschooled <br/>\nfaster than I have.)  I am just very glad that I did not start from the <br/>\nschool-at-home/purchased curriculum.  I am grateful for the wise heads <br/>\nwho advised me to deschool before deciding which path to take. <br/>\nUnschooling just naturally fell into place --- not that it&#39;s any less <br/>\nwork.  It&#39;s a constant challenge, but it&#39;s a fun challenge.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAlaura, I&#39;m in the Fredericksburg,VA area -- where are you?<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Alicia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38588,"nextTopicId":38584}}
