So our second official day, <br/>\nwe go out to this park about a mile from our apartment, we decided this would <br/>\nbe better sonce they don&#39;t want me to get hurt I can start out on the grass.  <br/>\nI am beginning to get the hang of  roller blading on the grass and my seven <br/>\nyear advances me to the sidewalk...that is when my nine year old decides that <br/>\nhe is tired of roller blading and wants to play on big toy.  So I give him <br/>\nthe car keys to change out his blades for his shoes...(can you see where this <br/>\nis leading?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI even make a point of explaining to him that if he leaves the keys in the <br/>\ntrunk then we have no way to get into the car.  Then he takes off for the <br/>\ncar.  Meanwhile I get into the whole sidewalk thing with the roller <br/>\nblades...Mostly I am concentrating on keeping my balance...there is a reason <br/>\nwhy my mom didn&#39;t name me Grace...she had a premonition when I was <br/>\nborn...well after a few minutes...my older son returned with his head <br/>\ndrooping...he starts out,,,&quot;Mom...I...it was an accident...&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing that comes to my mind is that he is playing with me...he <br/>\nlikes to play practical jokes from time to time...so I smile and I <br/>\nsay...&quot;Scotti, your playing with me rite...?&quot;  He says no really...I left the <br/>\nkeys in the trunk.  And I say...No really Scotti...you have got to be playing <br/>\nwith my mind.&quot;...and of course he says he isn&#39;t...well...we go over to the <br/>\ncar...and I am hoping that he deactivated the alarm before getting into the <br/>\ntrunk...but he didn&#39;t...car is locked...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other son is like...call grandma (she live next door) or aunt didi (she <br/>\nalso lives next door)...and of course they went to lunch right after we went <br/>\nto the part...and all my change is locked in the car as well...there is no <br/>\nother choice...we gotta walk home...so there we are trekking across the <br/>\npark...my youngest in roller blades...me in socks and carrying my roller <br/>\nblades...not enough experience to roller blade a mile...and my older son <br/>\nkinda moping along.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI let him know that I am not mad at him and as we walk home I ask...&quot;and so <br/>\nwhat did we learn today?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n*excert from the book that we will write some day called...&quot;The Adventures of <br/>\nUnschooling as told by Three Learners&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLhiza</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6062,"nextTopicId":6069}}
