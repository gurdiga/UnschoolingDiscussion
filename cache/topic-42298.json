Anyway, today Darin was off work (first day in a few months! yea!) <br/>\nand we were just having fun, catching up on some errands, hanging out and <br/>\nJack wore his Spiderman mask almost all day. (I talked him out of his full <br/>\ncostume, as it is getting a tad too small.) It is a cloth *mask* that fits <br/>\nover his head with two eye holes. It fits just like the *real* Spiderman <br/>\nmask. He wore it through Lowe&#39;s, Walmart, Pets Smart, the car wash, Olive <br/>\nGarden (he lifted it up to just above his mouth) and Barnes and Noble. We got <br/>\nstares, we got glares, we got smiles and heard whispered comments and laughs. <br/>\nHe climbed under a shelving unit at Lowe&#39;s and got turned around. I was <br/>\nmeasuring some wood and wasn&#39;t being a good pay-attention Mom and he found <br/>\nhimself lost. So Jack did what Jack is supposed to do and went to the front <br/>\nof the store and asked to have his Mom and Dad paged. Problem! Jack wouldn&#39;t <br/>\ntell them his name, he insisted he IS Spiderman, and his parents are dead and <br/>\nhe is being raised by his Aunt and Uncle... Needless to say I knew who they <br/>\nmeant when over the intercom I heard, &quot;Would the parents or aunt and uncle of <br/>\nSpiderman please come to the customer service desk.

My husband and I have seen it also and I was so stressed out after watching it I felt like a basketcase.  Very intense!!  Loved it but intense!  I really want to watch it with my son but I am so torn over it.  IMO  I have a responsibility to try and protect my children from things that they aren&#39;t emotionally ready to handle, But,  I also don&#39;t want to stifle or keep them too sheltered.  I do think that age appropriateness does have a place somewhere in parenting, but it is so hard to know where.  We had the same issue with Jurassic Park too.  Did let him watch it tho&#39; and he loved it but now he has said some &quot;swear&quot; words to other kids and they hadn&#39;t heard them before, so then of course I bore the brunt of that from the other parents.

For a <br/>\n  while, I took the videos away.  However, that didn&#39;t seem entirely fair.  He <br/>\n  derived so much pleasure and learned so much from the Thomas stuff I gave <br/>\n  them back.

I did have a question that I would like some input for - although I may already know what the response will be ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I rented Lord of the Rings. My 8 yr. old really wanted to see it. It was late when we sat down to watch it - so she was already in bed. After viewing it - I thought it too scary, with the monsters and all...  I told her this, and she &quot;promised not to have nightmares&quot; - like one could promise such a thing ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to be irresponsible. If we watch it and it seems to scary - she will still want to watch it. She is not going to self-regulate and say...&quot;this is too scary...&quot; we went through this with Jurassic park.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI then thought that we could read the book together, because then the monsters aren&#39;t always so vivid - but I remembered that I attempted to read Stephen King&#39;s Pet Cemetary as a 5th grader - and never finished because it was too scary...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what do you think...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:winnierfm@...\">winnierfm@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, August 27, 2002 8:20 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] I&#39;m offended (was Re: Eminem-long)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 8/27/02 9:04:50 AM US Mountain Standard Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheran@...\">sheran@...</a> writes: <br/>\n  &gt; And Shakespeare is too intense for young kids, or at least my young <br/>\n  &gt; kids.  But when they&#39;re older, I would read Shakespeare with my kids. <br/>\n  &gt; Books and even some tv shows and movies are  more comfortable for me <br/>\n  &gt; because I can sit and pause the reading or pause the movie and <br/>\n  &gt; discuss what is immoral with my kids. I can say this person is acting <br/>\n  &gt; wrong and these were the consequences of their behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hmmm....I read Shakespeare to my young ones (mostly sonnets though.)  Really, <br/>\n  I read them whatever I&#39;m reading...my oldest loves to be read to.<br/>\n<br/>\n  However, if you make a point to know what your children are reading, or <br/>\n  watching or listening to in music can&#39;t you discuss the consequences.  Here <br/>\n  is much milder version than raping a 12 yr old or other things discussed.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My son Andrew adores Thomas the Tank Engine.  He reads the books (even on his <br/>\n  own he&#39;ll look at the pictures for hours), collects the trains, watches the <br/>\n  videos, wears the clothes ect (I think you get the idea.)  One day I was <br/>\n  watching the video with him and heard the following &quot;Thomas and Henry felt <br/>\n  sorry for James but they teased him anyway.&quot;  Well, I don&#39;t want my son to <br/>\n  learn that it is ok to tease people no matter what the circumstances.  For a <br/>\n  while, I took the videos away.  However, that didn&#39;t seem entirely fair.  He <br/>\n  derived so much pleasure and learned so much from the Thomas stuff I gave <br/>\n  them back.  I watched this particular one with him several times and pointed <br/>\n  out that wasn&#39;t very nice.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My point is: it doesn&#39;t matter if it is books or videos or music they will be <br/>\n  exposed to things that go against any family&#39;s personal values.  Just the <br/>\n  same way as we point out wrong in a book or video can&#39;t we do the same with <br/>\n  music (if we know what they are listening to?)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was a child that the more something was forbidden the more I wanted <br/>\n  it...leading to dabblings in over drinking and other unsavory things...I hope <br/>\n  that I learned enough from that to give my children reasonable freedom.  How <br/>\n  much that is depends a lot on how the world is 10 yrs from now!<br/>\n  Tanya<br/>\n  mom to Andrew Jordan 4/1/00 and Eli Hunter 10/29/01<br/>\n  You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within <br/>\n  himself <br/>\n  --Galileo <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
