Your mother needs to understand and accept that YOUR kids are not HERS and that she has no right whatsoever to control your life and jeopardize YOUR rights to homeschool/unschool and parent your kids the way you want.<br/>\nYou don&#39;t mention the actual legal implications of what she&#39;s done, so it hard to say what to do in that respect, but as far as she is personaly concerned, I would defnitely write her off!<br/>\n<br/>\nYol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In a message dated 12/9/02 10:37:18 PM Central Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:QUALITY6263@...\">QUALITY6263@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  My own mother called CPS on me<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  for homeschooling my kids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; OK, my answer is pretty harsh.  I&#39;d move and cut her out of my life.  She&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; into active aggression.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My parents went from passive to active aggression over an issue.   I wrote<br/>\n&gt; them a letter saying that I was sorry about the choices they had made and<br/>\n&gt; that they needed to change if I was going to come back into their lives.  It<br/>\n&gt; was the best thing I had ever done up to that point in my life.  And it<br/>\n&gt; worked.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of course, now you have a government agency involved and she has put your<br/>\n&gt; family at great risk.  My situation was nothing compared to this.  I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know anything about your relationship with your mother or about you, but if<br/>\n&gt; it were to happen to me, that&#39;s what I would do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Elizabeth<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\nBlue Lotus Therapeutics<br/>\nAyurveda, Homeopathy, Yoga and Therapeutic Massage.<br/>\nAsheville/Weaverville, NC<br/>\nwww.bluelotustherapeutics.com<br/>\n<br/>\nDhyanyoga Center of North Carolina<br/>\nMeditation - Kundalini Maha Yoga<br/>\nWeaverville, NC<br/>\nwww.dyc-nc.org<br/>\n<br/>\n***********************************<br/>\nWhen nothing is done, nothing is left undone.
