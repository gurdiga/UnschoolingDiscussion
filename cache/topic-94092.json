I remember going to the La Brea Tar Pits (a 40 minutes <br/>\ndrive into Los Angeles) and speeding through the museum in about 15 <br/>\nminutes. I&#39;d had it in my head that we&#39;d spend half of the day there - <br/>\nI was seriously disappointed in my kids for not appreciating it more. <br/>\nBut, we piled back into the car and went to the Farmer&#39;s Market nearby <br/>\nand ate a mid-morning lunch and looked in shops for a while and went <br/>\nhome early and had a nice and unexpected free afternoon at home. It was <br/>\na nice day. And I overheard one of my kids telling another kid about <br/>\nthe Tar Pits and how awesome it was. Surprised me &lt;G&gt;.

Also it helps to know what <br/>\nthey&#39;re going to do at the end.

Maybe as gifts from family?  Maybe the organization has sliding fees (some institutions do this even though they don&#39;t really advertise it).  Perhaps get memberships to one or two in your area and then go primarily to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have memberships to the local museums and go to the local cheap theater ($1/person).  We do it precisely because it is then so easy to move on to something else if no one is having fun and you don&#39;t feel like you just blew $30 on the 15 minutes that you have been there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut without a membership, then I think it&#39;s like the donut example - better in the trash than eaten unwanted.  Cheerfully move on from the experience, or the $30 (already spent) will have been spent to make children&#39;s lives worse instead of better.  Which isn&#39;t to say that I would always, without fail, be able to do that -- but it is my goal, and thinking of it like the donuts helps. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso the museums around here often have a free day a week or free week once a year.

I mean how often do we get to Washington DC??? Don&#39;t we have to fit it ALL in????<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that I have to be more realistic.  To <br/>\n&quot;fit it all in&quot; would ruin the whole trip.  So instead I might plan to see one or two museums for the day and plan to eat at a particular place, or pack.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we get to more, fine.  If the kids change their minds about which places they want to see, fine.  My plan is basically for backup and at least I&#39;m not pushing to get through everything only to move to the next building.  (I&#39;ve seen parents who do that, yuck...its  just like eating the whole 18 donuts just because they are there, you spent the money, and you feel obligated.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn trips, the most important things are being comfortable, having plenty handy to eat/drink, getting plenty of rest before the trip, and taking plenty of breaks that are *not* time limited during the trip.  For example, if your child is interested in just climbing on the McDonalds play gym for an hour, let him do it....even though you want to go see the Aerospace museum.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso plan a day or two of downtime AFTER the trip if its a big one.  Pajama and Movie days are great for this.  But let your child decide if how much down time he needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have to take more time to do those things, then plan it in.  You&#39;ll regret it if you don&#39;t!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the same applies when you are planning things to &quot;strew&quot;.  Just be open to other bunny trails along the way, and embrace them, enjoy them, and be ready to put your plans away for awhile.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour plans should be the jumper cables, not the engine of your unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, May 15, 2004 1:37 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] planning ; more practically than spirituality<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 5/15/04 9:55:24 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamaaj2000@...\">mamaaj2000@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; I&#39;m struggling to understand this.

I know I&#39;m very, very new to <br/>\n<br/>\nunschooling, but I feel like I&#39;m going to need to plan ahead a lot in <br/>\n<br/>\norder to strew interesting things about, plan trips that go well, etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPlanning can be good if you can be flexible about it.  Sometimes a plan <br/>\nbecomes a list of things that didn&#39;t happen right, and that&#39;s sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I plan a trip to the zoo, my thoughts are who has to back when, should we <br/>\ntake our own water, is there something to carry hats and sunscreen in?  When <br/>\nwe had babies, the stroller served well.  With walking kids, we need a <br/>\nbackpack.  Is there a feeding-time consideration?<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, more planning would be too much.  Maybe the kids won&#39;t have <br/>\nfun, maybe it will be full of school groups, or too hot, or someone will feel <br/>\nwoozy.   Maybe we&#39;ll leave early and eat on the way home.   Maybe it will be <br/>\nPERFECT, cool breezes, not crowded, and we&#39;ll eat there, and feed koi and <br/>\nducks, and take our time and hang out in the gift shop.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I decide before we go how I want the day to be, I&#39;m likely to be <br/>\ndisappointed.<br/>\nIf I don&#39;t make ANY plans and it turns out we really, truly needed sunscreen <br/>\nand some hats but I hadn&#39;t brought any, and Holly&#39;s friend had to be home by <br/>\n1:00, so leaving at 11:00 instead of 9:30 was a bad plan, then I&#39;ll wish I had <br/>\nbeen more practical.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving the openness and in-the-moment attitude to be willing to go where the <br/>\nday leads you doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t make sure there&#39;s gas in the car. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94204,"nextTopicId":94181}}
