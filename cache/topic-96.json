GWS seemed to &quot;grow up&quot; with the core<br/>\ngroup readership that supported it over the first 10-15 years. As those<br/>\npeople who regularly contributed articles, essays, interviews, etc. saw<br/>\ntheir children growing into teenagers, they wrote about teens; and when<br/>\neditor Susannah Sheffer decided to involve more kids in the writing (she<br/>\nwrote a book about helping kids learn to write), the core group of kids she<br/>\ncontacted for articles remained much the same over the years, and as those<br/>\nkids grew up, so did the content of GWS, so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur own kids are 13-25 now, so the same might have happened with HEM easily<br/>\nenough, but as you say, the bulk of the families looking for support and<br/>\nencouragement have younger children. So we worked at selecting articles for<br/>\nthat audience in particular, including hiring columnists and editors with<br/>\nyounger kids while still working to maintain our position as the premier<br/>\nmagazine for homeschooling activists. I like to think we achieved some kind<br/>\nof balance, with enough content for the experienced parents to stay<br/>\ninterested while serving that larger segment of our readership with younger<br/>\nkids, but it&#39;s always a balancing act, and it&#39;s pretty hard to please all<br/>\nof the people all of the time. We just give it our best shot and smile real<br/>\nbig when people tell us they love HEM. &lt;s&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Helen@...\">Helen@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://unschooling.com\">http://unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;<br/>\nExpectations, be they of our own<br/>\ncreation or be they the brainchild<br/>\nof another, are hellish loads.<br/>\n&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;:&lt;:&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Carol E.
