I know 4H is really into doing a lot <br/>\nwith the horses. I never did it but I had a girlfriend who was in it when we <br/>\nwere younger and it was quite and exciting time for us. Everything is about <br/>\nhorses! Of course that&#39;s the way I like things. I never got into the showing <br/>\npart but I have worked with horses one way or another all my adult life and <br/>\nit has been great. Now I am a licensed Harness horse trainer after working my <br/>\nway up through the ranks. If your daughter really wants to work with horses <br/>\nthen through 4H I think she would get a good idea of the work involved with <br/>\nhorses. Nobody in my family had or worked around horses so I just took the <br/>\nleap and got into it one way or another. It has just been the best time. Now <br/>\nI own a race horse and my 2 son&#39;s go to the farm every morning with me and my <br/>\n8 year old has started to learn to jog the horses. It&#39;s not an easy life but <br/>\nwhen you love something it makes it all the better. I also want to say that I <br/>\nlearned everything about horses and got my license all without school. In <br/>\nfact I could have done it sooner if I hadn&#39;t been in school.<br/>\nJust my 2 cents. When somebody talks horses I like to jump in.<br/>\n<br/>\nLori in MI<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45336,"nextTopicId":45379}}
