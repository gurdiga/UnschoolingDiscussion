I was suggesting that we can discuss choices with our kids - and sometimes they still make choices different to ours! I think the discussions you mentioned above, with your kids, are a big part of unschooling, at least here  at our house - conversational learning. Yes, this discussion happens with other forms of schooling but not in such quantities as in unschooling ...You said, in another post, that you&#39;re not ready to unschool - but these discussions with your kids can let you see what unschooling may be like for you...Leonie W. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42121,"nextTopicId":42039}}
