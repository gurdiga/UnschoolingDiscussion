If I hear one more teacher whine that she &quot;only makes <br/>\n$37,000&quot;.  Grrrr.  For a job where you&#39;re home by three, have <br/>\nweekends off and a &quot;year&quot; is 36 weeks, $37,000 is decent money.  In <br/>\nmy hometown, my high school was shut down (I was in the last <br/>\ngraduating class) because of lack of funds.  The teachers were making <br/>\n$60,000 and the average citizen was making about $20,000 when the <br/>\nmill wasn&#39;t on strike (the mill is *always* on strike).  The teachers <br/>\nwent on strike to try to force the parents to pass *another* levy for <br/>\nmore money and the parents said no.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorcha</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126884268,"authorName":"HMSL2@aol.com","from":"HMSL2@...","profile":"dobsiedoe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"was Wasting your potential now imagine this!","postDate":"1052498158","msgId":68286,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFiLjJjYmM5OTNkLjJiZWQzMmVlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":68307,"prevInTime":68285,"nextInTime":68287,"topicId":68286,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/9/2003 11:38:57 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...
