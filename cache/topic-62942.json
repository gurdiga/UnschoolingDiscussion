The adults all treated the <br/>\nchildren with such respect.  Not just their own children but all the <br/>\nchildren.  The children had freedom.  Parents watching but not interfering.  <br/>\nJust allowing their children to explore.  It was really great for my children <br/>\nand when you see a room full of unschooled children you can really see how <br/>\nthey are different.  Confident, with ideas and thoughts, questions and <br/>\nanswers.<br/>\nGreat for my boys.<br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] A thank you and a conference?","postDate":"1049490927","msgId":62967,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhYi4xMmQ1ZGRlYS4yYmJmNGZlZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62942,"nextInTopic":62978,"prevInTime":62966,"nextInTime":62968,"topicId":62942,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/4/2003 11:27:13 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...
