I enjoy just hearing<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; you are out there, living your lives in a similar way, so I can get ideas<br/>\n&gt; or just say &quot;that sounds neat&quot; or &quot;me too.&quot;  I forgot to get specific<br/>\n&gt; earlier, so here are some things I want to know your thoughts on:<br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s your approach to reading? My daughter is almost 6 and has been on<br/>\n&gt; the verge of reading for awhile without really taking off yet. Do you just<br/>\n&gt; read to them until they figure it out? Do you talk about some of the<br/>\nsounds<br/>\n&gt; letters make or ignore phonics completely? Have regular reading practice<br/>\n&gt; where I listen to her and tell her the words or never ask her to read<br/>\n&gt; unless it&#39;s her idea? Cindy, it sounds like you have a very advanced<br/>\n&gt; reader, what are Ruth Beechick books and BOB books? I don&#39;t mean to sound<br/>\n&gt; like I&#39;m rushing it, but there&#39;s so much she can explore on her own when<br/>\n&gt; she can read.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have some thoughts on unschooling music or giving music<br/>\n&gt; lessons? My daughter has expressed interest in playing the piano and my<br/>\n&gt; sister, my mother, and I can all play and so there&#39;s plenty of free<br/>\n&gt; teachers, but I want her to love music too, so I&#39;m uncertain about lessons<br/>\n&gt; (I took lessons until about age 10, then hated having to practice). I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; read that playing an instrument is beneficial in both emotional and<br/>\n&gt; intellectual ways, but I also read that a lot of the best musicians are<br/>\n&gt; self-taught.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your input!<br/>\n&gt; Becky in AR<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Remember Father&#39;s Day Is June 18th<br/>\n&gt; Click Here For Great Gifts!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/5037/7/_/448294/_/960246324/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/5037/7/_/448294/_/960246324/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To Unsubscribe: mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"marbleface@aol.com","from":"marbleface@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"mphgLeYJY54lueXIL35J-HyWR_W61D7thc-n0HWC-DgpMc8j1ltxUpR35Qgk_IlsTMzozWmD06uQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] reading, music with almost 6yo","postDate":"960294666","msgId":8948,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ5LjUxMDcwMzQuMjY2ZTQ5MGFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":8945,"nextInTopic":9000,"prevInTime":8947,"nextInTime":8949,"topicId":8930,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 06/06/2000 12:12:50 PM !!!First Boot!!!, Jaam1224@cs.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1081983428\">In a message dated 06/06/2000 12:12:50 PM !!!First Boot!!!, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jaam1224@...\">Jaam1224@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; <br/>\n Nance,<br/>\n I think you already told me but I forgot.

My now 7 yo son started to read with very little <br/>\nprompting at age 4 1/2.  When we saw he was catching on, we read with him a <br/>\nlot and still do.  My daughter is now 5 1/2.  She has been on the verge of <br/>\nreading forever (it seems) -- knows the letters and sounds and a few sight <br/>\nwords.  But the whole reading thing has just not clicked yet.  So, with her, <br/>\nI get a huge stack of books from the library every week, read with her a lot, <br/>\nanswer her questions and help her realize when she _is_ reading.  Sometimes <br/>\nshe does not acknowledge that she is reading because it&#39;s not a whole story.  <br/>\nBut if she can read a color (she&#39;s a big artist!!) or a sign or a phrase I <br/>\npraise her for her &quot;good reading.&quot;  Bits and pieces are starting to click but <br/>\nI think she will be my &quot;late bloomer&quot; in this regard.  OTOH, she had me show <br/>\nher how to use her brother&#39;s Math Shark game the other day because she wanted <br/>\nto practice her subtraction and we made up a number line and that helped her <br/>\n(her brother was never interested in that sort of visual device).  So maybe <br/>\nthat&#39;s what her brain is working on right now.  Along with being a kid -- <br/>\nwhich takes up a lot of her energy!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPiano/music:  My son is now taking formal piano less.  For the last few <br/>\nmonths.  He just had his first recital on Saturday and played two songs <br/>\nbeautifully.  He enjoys the lessons, hates the practice, and does quite well <br/>\nwith as much practice as he chooses to do.  His teacher totally &quot;gets&quot; him.  <br/>\nShe does not nag him to do more than he does and he is proceceding at his own <br/>\npace.   And doing quite well with it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter, meanwhile, has just finished up her dance lessons for the year.  <br/>\nThey were a lot of fun and gave her a taste of a &quot;non-Mom&quot; class.  And she <br/>\nloved playing with the other little girls.  There were no boys in her class <br/>\nbut one in the class before hers so I&#39;m hoping she&#39;ll see that mix as well <br/>\nalong the way.  Anyway, it was a fun, positive experience for her.  She will <br/>\nprobably want to continue when they start up again this fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son also takes Tae Kwon Do.  He goes to the hour-long class from 3-5 times <br/>\na week.  Last week his school put on an exhibition for one of the local elem <br/>\nschools and he was asked to participate, so that was a pat on the back and he <br/>\nhad fun.  Also they test periodically for the next belt and have to learn <br/>\nkicks and memorize steps (called forms) and they are learning a smattering of <br/>\nKorean and it is a great palling around with the guys (with some awesome <br/>\ngirls mixed in!) time.   This will continue thru the summer as often as he <br/>\nlikes.  My only &quot;rule&quot; on this is I won&#39;t go anywhere on the weekend if I can <br/>\nhelp it so he doesn&#39;t go to Saturday class.  Of course, all their testing <br/>\n(and every other sort of recital) seems to be on Sat morning so there goes <br/>\nanother &quot;rule.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son also just finished up for the year in the on-line math class he is <br/>\ntaking.  He did very well and went thru the material at his own pace and will <br/>\ncontinue with the class in the fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, we do a few outside activities.  Some unschoolers do not.  <br/>\nThe beauty of hsing!!  They have generally been a positive experience (except <br/>\nfor one piano teacher who ran a class that was more of a play group than a <br/>\nreal music class and then gave me a fight when I wanted my $$ back -- but I <br/>\ngot it -- $200 is a lot of $$ around here!!).  The kids like these classes <br/>\nand I think they supplement the other things we do nicely.  I&#39;m sure the <br/>\nchoice in activities will change many times but we like getting out and <br/>\nabout.  And at least I know where all my $$ is going!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes our getting out and about is free tho.  There are lots of nice <br/>\nparks and beaches and nature trails around so we are also just literally <br/>\noutside a lot (Florida).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one more thing on reading:  get you child a library card!!!  Mine love <br/>\nthat whole idea of having their own card (even if it is in my purse) and we <br/>\ncan get 3 X the books now!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, you caught me on a chatty morning, didn&#39;t you!  :):)<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bonnie Painter","from":"&quot;Bonnie Painter&quot; &lt;bonniepainter@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"2FGFVJ5TcrL8sYQljRLiEDG_HaQCiSu2k3FinalXQ-kF9HUBk6yWhzdd1kKXbgFPTdzUoDxiqEuWNDhqHhrBeJb5hb769U7xVWPcmEQqO0YrUrM","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] reading, music with almost 6yo","postDate":"960255153","msgId":8930,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNjA2MDEzMjMzLjMyODQ5LnFtYWlsQGhvdG1haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8939,"prevInTime":8929,"nextInTime":8931,"topicId":8930,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Becky, Usborne Books has a great series on Piano that I think an older child could look at and use for self-teaching.

Of course, it&#39;s $200, but I knew that my neighbor&#39;s had it and that <br/>\ntheir son had never played with it, so I borrowed theirs.  It&#39;s a great game <br/>\nand the kids really enjoy playing it.
