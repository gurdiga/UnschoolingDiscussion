We&#39;ve been<br/>\nunschooling for the past few months and it stresses me out too much not<br/>\nhaving something concrete everyday. We are going to try Oak Meadow this<br/>\nfall. I&#39;m glad to hear you like it. I doubt we&#39;ll follow it to a tee, but<br/>\nit&#39;s nice to have something to fall back on.<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendalina1@...\">Wendalina1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 04, 2000 8:28 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Hello<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m new to the list and I wanted to introduce myself. My name is Wendy and<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; live in Little Rock, Arkansas. We&#39;re homeschooling leaning toward more of<br/>\nan<br/>\n&gt; unschooling approach. My son Dylan is six and Tristan is four. The past<br/>\ntwo<br/>\n&gt; years, I&#39;ve purchased Oak Meadow which I really like. However, we haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; picked it up for a couple months now so I would say we are on our way to<br/>\n&gt; unschooling. My son Dylan LOVES numbers and money. He really is doing well<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; math. On the other hand, he hates reading. I totally believe in<br/>\nunschooling<br/>\n&gt; but honestly, it has been hard for me to not worry. I&#39;m not asking for any<br/>\n&gt; advice or anything. It&#39;s just nice to know there are others out there like<br/>\n&gt; me.  I guess I&#39;m still dealing with a husband who doesn&#39;t really &quot;get it&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;m glad to be here and look forward to participating in this<br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wendy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
