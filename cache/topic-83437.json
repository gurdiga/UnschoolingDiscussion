Or that he<br/>\ncomplained about stylized camera work that was so evidently deliberate<br/>\nand planned. A tidbit about the film is that the actor portraying Fran&#39;s<br/>\nfather was the Spanish National flamenco champion or some similar title.<br/>\nHis dancing is cool. The film is full of some of the grand actors of<br/>\ntheir generation in Australia. I once designed costumes for a play with<br/>\nPat Thomson. She was a wonderful raconteur and world traveler,<br/>\nentertaining all of us during rehearsals, as well as really good in the<br/>\nshow. Paul Mercurio is the son of a well known (Australian) character<br/>\nactor Gus Mercurio. When I was working wardrobe on &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;<br/>\nin Sydney in the early eighties, it was rumored that Paul had been<br/>\nslated to take over the part of the son (the &quot;juvenile&quot; as it is called<br/>\nin musical theater), which was played by Gerry Sont (an old friend of<br/>\nmine from high school, now a soap star in Australia). It didn&#39;t happen<br/>\nat the time, although the dancing required for that particular character<br/>\nwas incidental, unlike the Cagelles, who had some pretty big and fancy<br/>\ndancing. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Movie","postDate":"1067563520","msgId":83468,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3QUIwQzkwLTBCNDEtMTFEOC04RDQwLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAyODAwMWMzOWY0MSRiMzE5MGQ4MCQ2NDAwYThjMEBsaXZpbmdyb29tMT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAyODAwMWMzOWY0MSRiMzE5MGQ4MCQ2NDAwYThjMEBsaXZpbmdyb29tMT4="},"prevInTopic":83467,"nextInTopic":83469,"prevInTime":83467,"nextInTime":83469,"topicId":83437,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think it would be upsetting, Rue.

Surely nobody  <br/>\nin Australia dresses like this, talks like this, takes ballroom dancing  <br/>\nas seriously as this? They do? The true weirdness of the movie comes  <br/>\nwhen we begin to realize the director didn&#39;t make everything up; only  <br/>\nreal life could possibly have inspired a world this bizarre.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe movie, which crosses Astaire and Rodgers with Mickey and Judy and  <br/>\nadds a dash of Spinal Tap, is a comedy posing as a docudrama about  <br/>\ncompetitive ballroom dancing in Australia. Everyone in the movie takes  <br/>\nthe sport, or art, with deadly seriousness, and their world revolves  <br/>\naround the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Amateur Championships (which, despite  <br/>\nits grand name, seems to be a local event). Like synchronized swimming  <br/>\n(the most hilarious event in Olympics history), competitive ballroom  <br/>\ndancing is essentially lighthearted fun spoiled by lead-footed rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe film&#39;s hero is Scott (Paul Mercurio), a pleasant young man with a  <br/>\nmad light in his eyes, who, according to the pseudodocumentary that  <br/>\nopens the film, was born to win the Pan-Pacific. But then he  <br/>\njeopardizes his chances by recklessly ignoring the rules, and forcing  <br/>\nhis partner to join him in a dance routine that was (gasp!) spontaneous  <br/>\nand improvised.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis partner is enraged, and leaves him. His mother, a former  <br/>\nchampionship dancer, is beside herself. The estimable Barry Fife (Bill  <br/>\nHunter), the autocratic czar of ballroom contests, is deeply offended.  <br/>\nOnly the good-hearted Fran (Tara Morice) believes in him, and offers to  <br/>\nbecome his partner. This is despite her lack of experience, her general  <br/>\nungainliness, and her homely appearance. Familiar with the great  <br/>\ntradition of come-from-behind movies, however, we somehow suspect that  <br/>\nif she ever takes off those glasses, and does something with her hair .  <br/>\n. .<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; was directed and co-written by Baz Luhrmann, who,  <br/>\naccording to the movie&#39;s press materials, has been fascinated with the  <br/>\ninsular world of Australian competitive ballroom dancing since he was a  <br/>\nyouth. The story, by Luhrmann and various collaborators, was first  <br/>\nstaged as an amateur production 10 years ago, and has been through many  <br/>\nincarnations leading up to this film, which is so tightly packed with  <br/>\ncharacters and situations that it seems, in its own way, as obsessed as  <br/>\nthe dancers themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuhrmann, like many first-time directors, is intoxicated with the  <br/>\npossibilities of the camera. He uses too many wide-angle shots, in  <br/>\nwhich the characters look like blowfish mugging for the lens, and too  <br/>\nmany story lines, until we worry we may have lost track of something,  <br/>\nbut what works is an exuberance that cannot be faked. As Scott and Fran  <br/>\nprepare for the Pan-Pacifics, as Barry Fife struggles to retain his  <br/>\nstranglehold on competitive dancing, as Scott discovers that his meek  <br/>\nand silent father was once a Pan-Pacific contender, the movie hurtles  <br/>\ntoward a conclusion sanctified by &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; and so many  <br/>\nother movies we could hold a trivia contest just by naming them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s best about the movie is the sense of madness and mania running  <br/>\njust beneath its surface. In one sense, the characters care about  <br/>\nnothing but ballroom dancing. They eat, drink and sleep it, and talk of  <br/>\nnothing else. Their costumes alone are a tip-off that they&#39;ve had no  <br/>\ncontact with the real world for years. Yet in another sense, ballroom  <br/>\ndancing is simply the strategy they use to hold the world at bay. They  <br/>\nare profoundly frightened of change, and have created an insular little  <br/>\nworld, with rigid rules and traditions; here they can be in control, as  <br/>\nthe larger world goes haywire. Scott&#39;s attempt to introduce anarchy -  <br/>\nand new dance steps - into their tiny enclave is all the funnier  <br/>\nbecause he, too, cares about nothing but dancing. He doesn&#39;t even want  <br/>\nto be a rebel. But it&#39;s in his blood.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/ebert/ebert_reviews/1993/02/844215.html\">http://www.suntimes.com/ebert/ebert_reviews/1993/02/844215.html</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 30, 2003, at 10:52 AM, Tia Leschke wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Ballroom Dancing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s it about?

Puccio <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/StrictlyBallroom-1045568/\">http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/StrictlyBallroom-1045568/</a> <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nMost audiences are probably more familiar with the name Baz Lurhmann <br/>\nfrom his second and third films, &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; and &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; <br/>\nthan from his 1992 directorial debut, &quot;Strictly Ballroom.&quot; Yet when <br/>\none compares the three films, it is the first that takes the honors. <br/>\nStill, you have to admire Lurhmann as a man who takes chances. <br/>\nIn &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; he updated Shakespeare&#39;s Verona to Southern <br/>\nCalifornia and traded in the Bard&#39;s swords for automatic weapons. <br/>\nIn &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; he took a grand opera plot and turned it on its <br/>\nhead with modern pop tunes and outrageous costumes. They were daring <br/>\nrisks that paid off for some viewers and turned off others, like me.<br/>\n<br/>\n But &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; shows all the signs of these films to come <br/>\nwithout resort to the gimmickry of the later efforts. For <br/>\nme, &quot;Ballroom&quot; remains Luhrmann&#39;s best all-around movie to date.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe film is a romantic musical-comedy set in the milieu of Australian <br/>\nballroom dance competitions. At first it takes the mock-documentary <br/>\napproach of a &quot;Spinal Tap,&quot; &quot;Waiting for Guffman,&quot; or &quot;Best in Show&quot; <br/>\nand goes for easy lampooning. Luhrmann, who cowrote the story and <br/>\nscreenplay, pokes fun at the over-serious self-importance of the <br/>\ndance competitors, the nastiness and backbiting, the fierceness of <br/>\nthe competitions, and the irregularities of the judging. Elaborate <br/>\nhairstyles and whimsical hairpieces get particularly cheeky, humorous <br/>\ntreatment. But as the story goes on, it loses track of this satiric <br/>\ncore and develops into a warmhearted, Cinderella-style romance, with <br/>\nan ending that will leave you cheering. For once, I appreciated a <br/>\nfilm&#39;s divergence from its initial focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul Mercurio stars as a young dance competitor, Scott Hastings, a <br/>\nfellow raised to be a champion. He and his parents, Doug and Shirley <br/>\n(Barry Otto and Pat Thomson), former dance competitors themselves, <br/>\nhave high aspirations for Scott&#39;s winning the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix <br/>\nChampionships, apparently the World Series/Super Bowl of ballroom <br/>\ndance contests. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut Scott wants to be his own man, so to speak, and amplify his own <br/>\nflashy dance steps, something his parents and the Australian Dance <br/>\nFederation won&#39;t allow. In fact, Scott gets so fancy with his <br/>\nimprovisational moves that his partner leaves him in despair. What to <br/>\ndo? He reluctantly picks up a beginning dancer, Fran (Tara Morice), <br/>\nwho shows promise; but she&#39;s a plain-looking girl, downright <br/>\nunattractive and clumsy by dancing-contest standards. Nevertheless, <br/>\nScott gives her a chance with him, they develop a Spanish dance <br/>\nroutine, and, of course, the unsightly bud eventually blossoms.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy to see how &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; evolved from this film, <br/>\nespecially in the music, the glitz, the glamour, the romance, the off-<br/>\nkilter humor, and the fanciful sets, even to a rooftop romp. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, too, the complications are similar in nature. In &quot;Strictly <br/>\nBallroom&quot; the dance contests are built up as the biggest things since <br/>\nthe World Olympics, and politics dominate everything from the dance <br/>\nsteps to the participants&#39; choice of partners. The story&#39;s <br/>\nantagonist, Barry Fife (Bill Hunter), is ceaselessly trying to <br/>\nmanipulate things, from the affairs of the Dance Federation to <br/>\neveryone involved in it, a veritable Machiavelli of the mambo. Well, <br/>\nthe tango, actually, but mambo is more alliterative. And besides the <br/>\ntango, there&#39;s the waltz and a bit of flamenco. There&#39;s music for <br/>\neveryone. The plot is predictable, to be sure, but it&#39;s fun to follow <br/>\nalong, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n Mercurio and Morice are easygoing, likable young people, and <br/>\neventually everybody gets involved in the spirit of the dancing, even <br/>\nFran&#39;s parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@p...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is that the exact title?
