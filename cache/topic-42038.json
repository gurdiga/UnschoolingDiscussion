Medical Exemption: All 50 states in the U.S. allow for a medical<br/>\nexemption. A few states allow licensed naturopathic or chiropractic doctors<br/>\nto issue medical exemptions in addition to medical doctors. However, few<br/>\npediatricians check for indications of increased risk before administering<br/>\nvaccines, so it is advisable for parents to research this matter for<br/>\nthemselves. Epilepsy, severe allergies, and siblings&#39; previous adverse<br/>\nreactions are but a few of the many conditions in child or family history<br/>\nwhich may qualify for a medical exemption;<br/>\n  2.. Religious Exemption: Nearly all states allow for a religious<br/>\nexemption; this may not require membership in an established religious<br/>\norganization (individual state laws vary); and<br/>\n  3.. Philosophical Exemption: An increasing number of states allow<br/>\nphilosophical exemptions, in recognition of the controversy and/or violation<br/>\nof freedom that mandated vaccination laws impose<br/>\nIf you need a religious reason even if your not religious well this article<br/>\nmight help (as in regards to abortion - you can always say you don&#39;t believe<br/>\nin the use of aborted human fetuses for vaccines!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThese viruses have been cross-mutated in animals, contain animal DNA &<br/>\nRNA, have more than just diptheria,tetanus, polio, hepatitis, measles,<br/>\nmumps, rubella etc. etc...in fact, hepatitis A, chickenpox, and rubella<br/>\nare made from aborted human fetal tissue.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck in your decision making <br/>\nSue<br/>\n.<br/>\nAs far as the vaccines derived from human cell lines, this explains it as<br/>\nwell as I&#39;ve seen it anywhere: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cogforlife.org/vaxbrochsample.htm\">http://www.cogforlife.org/vaxbrochsample.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42036,"nextTopicId":42047}}
