But Helen&#39;s message struck me. I didn&#39;t appreciate her method but <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;understood her madness.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;The plain fact is that we seem to have cycles on this list. The good, <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;bad and oh yes, the ugly.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;We have moments when we shine. When we all come together to help one<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;another question and answer our collective approaches to schooling,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;unschooling and parenting in general. These are the moments when we <br/>\n&gt;-each<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;of us- contribute just a little something, a little bit of our own <br/>\n&gt;flavor<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;and when taken in create a masterpiece.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;Then we have moments when we get a little thoughtless or insensitive.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;Perhaps too sensitive is what I should say. Moments when for just a New<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;York minute we let the bad in and become JUDGEMENTAL.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;That&#39;s okay. This list is full of moms, dads, teachers, leaders and <br/>\n&gt;since<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;we&#39;re all human on this list, the occasional screw-ups. But we <br/>\n&gt;acknowledge,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;apologize and move on. And thank goodness for the occasional screw up. <br/>\n&gt;They<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;remind us to think before we speak, to consider and reconsider the way <br/>\n&gt;we<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;treat or mistreat others, such consideration is probably a big asset <br/>\n&gt;for a<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;group of folks attempting to guide their young-ins and deschool <br/>\n&gt;themselves<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;at the same time.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;The problem is when the Ugly sneaks it&#39;s ugly face in. Ahh, the moments<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;when we tear down instead of buildup. Then we go back in and do it <br/>\n&gt;again.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;The long, long debates on whether so and so said what they said they <br/>\n&gt;said<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;and so forth. Usually followed by people upset about all the people <br/>\n&gt;saying<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;what was or was not said and then the comments about how people should <br/>\n&gt;go<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;and say things somewhere else.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;This is not new for us. But it is shameful. Because when we are good, <br/>\n&gt;we<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;are AWESOME! When we shine it is because, as a group we encourage, <br/>\n&gt;support<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;and unite.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;I do not care for the way Helen responded to the UGLY. But I do think <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;came from an emotional place of frustration and disappointment that it <br/>\n&gt;had<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;come back again. And let&#39;s face it, when folks start telling other <br/>\n&gt;folks to<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;get on other lists, UGLY has come back in a big way.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;Shame on us. Do you know what I do when the ugly comes? When the first<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;whiff of ugly has come I try to ignore it by becoming real friendly <br/>\n&gt;with my<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;delete button. But at times like this, times when UGLY has come back <br/>\n&gt;all<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;the way and brought friends, I leave. That&#39;s right. I&#39;ve been off this <br/>\n&gt;list<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;several times and I&#39;m about to do it again. And that&#39;s okay too. <br/>\n&gt;Because<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;the true feeling of this list is strong enough to survive even the ugly <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;the disappearance of one or two faces. Ugly is like a fire and if we <br/>\n&gt;all<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;just stop feeding the flames IT WILL GO AWAY.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;Sooner or later The Good will come back and when it does I and the <br/>\n&gt;others<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;who have already quietly slipped away for a bit will come back. I just <br/>\n&gt;hope<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;in the meantime that we haven&#39;t already permanently alienated some of <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;wonderful people on this list who maybe don&#39;t understand our ups and <br/>\n&gt;downs.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;The list will survive, but it could come back and bloom and thrive if <br/>\n&gt;only<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;we would all work just a little harder to stop feeding the ugly and <br/>\n&gt;start<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;working The Good.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;Well, just my two cents, bye all, Jacli :)<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;Message: 1 &gt; Date: Sat, 23 Mar 2002 11:58:57 -0800 &gt; From: Helen <br/>\n&gt;Hegener<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;Subject: Checking in/checking out &gt; &gt;Dear friends and listmembers, &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;It&#39;s a major disappointment to see this list fall back into the same<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;kind of downward spiral we experienced a few weeks (or was it <br/>\n&gt; &gt;months?)<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;ago. &gt;... It was truly discouraging to see the disparaging remarks <br/>\n&gt; &gt;about<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;our magazine in the middle of this discussion ... &gt; To see our magazine<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;called into question &gt;because of what someone who happens to write for <br/>\n&gt;us<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;does on this list &gt;was probably the final straw for me. &gt;I&#39;ll be blunt. <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;do not have the time nor the interest in being &gt;involved with the kinds <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;dynamics I&#39;ve read here in the last few &gt;hours.... &gt; For that reason, I <br/>\n&gt;am<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;removing all &gt;references to HEM from this list, turning this list over <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;the &gt;moderators, unsubscribing, and getting on with what needs doing in <br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;life. I wish you all the best in finding appropriate resolutions. &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;Helen ____________________________________________________________ _ <br/>\n&gt;Get<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;a Taste of Religion: ~LICK A WITCH~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33860,"nextTopicId":10948}}
