Do I think worry two kids are at risk considering that <br/>\nboth their parents had problems in the past?  Of course.  One of the things <br/>\nI&#39;ve done is bring them to Narcotics Anonymous meetings that allow kids because I <br/>\nthink they hear things that are a lot more effective than any school based <br/>\nprogram I ever heard of.  (I&#39;d take them to AA too, but in my area these almost <br/>\nnever allow kids.)  As they get older I will educate them as best I can, <br/>\nincluding teaching them the latest findings about the genetic and biochemical <br/>\nfactors involved.  But in the long run it will have to be their choice.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154343532,"authorName":"CloseKnitFamilyOf3","from":"&quot;CloseKnitFamilyOf3&quot; &lt;CabinOnTheLedge@...&gt;","profile":"closeknitfamilyof3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Thanks Was:Sorta OT Question","postDate":"1058850574","msgId":77223,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJmaWd1ZSs3bjI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJmZzFjMis4MWI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77068,"nextInTopic":77224,"prevInTime":77222,"nextInTime":77224,"topicId":77027,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Shelly for responding to my question.
