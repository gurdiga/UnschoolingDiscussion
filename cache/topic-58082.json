I<br/>\n&gt; guess it depends on the actor. When asked what kind of director he likes, the<br/>\n&gt; actor will generally fall into one of two categories. Either he wants a<br/>\n&gt; director with an exact vision of what he wants---who can verbalize exactly<br/>\n&gt; what he sees in his head. Or he likes a director who is &quot;hands off&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; allows him the freedom to &quot;become&quot; that character the ACTOR sees in HIS head.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Both the actor and the director can and should have a vision of the<br/>\ncharacter in their heads. The director&#39;s job is half over when they have<br/>\ncast the right actor. But usually an actor cannot do it alone, because they<br/>\nonly have their part in their vision and the director has the whole<br/>\nproduction in their&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, if a director says to me &quot;Go for it, it&#39;s all yours&quot; that is too<br/>\nmuch freedom. Just like they shouldn&#39;t say &quot;Here&#39;s is exactly how to say<br/>\nthis&quot; and then demonstrates it. It should be an organic, symbiotic<br/>\nrelationship.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":56051484,"authorName":"grlynbl@aol.com","from":"grlynbl@...","profile":"tbb1967","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 3002","postDate":"1044561311","msgId":58093,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQuOTNmNjlkNS4yYjc0MTc5ZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58082,"nextInTopic":58233,"prevInTime":58092,"nextInTime":58094,"topicId":58082,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/6/03 1:58:46 PM Eastern Standard Time, jnjstau@gvtc.com ...
