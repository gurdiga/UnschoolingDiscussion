I don&#39;t know what changed.  When he was 7 and 8 he really didn&#39;t<br/>\neven recognize most of the alphabet.  We wanted to have him tested, he was<br/>\nbeginning to be unhappy and doubting if he would ever learn to read.  Then<br/>\nwe discovered that our insurance didn&#39;t pay for testing and it would cost<br/>\nway more than we could pay.  If we had gone through the school system i was<br/>\nconcerned about them freaking out about a 9 year old that couldn&#39;t read at<br/>\nall.  So, we didn&#39;t do anything but eventually something clicked and he is<br/>\nslowly getting this reading thing.  We thought that my oldest son was a<br/>\nlate reader when he didn&#39;t start reading until just before his 9th<br/>\nbirthday.  The middle 2 boys both started reading at 7 1/2, late for some<br/>\npeople but seemed early to us:)  My daughter is going on 6 and she knows a<br/>\nlot of the letters but is no where near reading yet.  i still wonder if my<br/>\n10 year old has some type of learning disability but we are relieved that<br/>\nif there is something there at least it is no longer preventing him from<br/>\nlearning to read.<br/>\nBy the way, my oldest is now 16 1/2 and an avid reader.<br/>\nSusanna Eve in Halifax, NS, Canada</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] unschooling / late reading /  reassurance","postDate":"1030551799","msgId":42357,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDgyODA5MTczMS4wMWNlNTZkMEBwb3AuaXNsYW5kbmV0LmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEI5OTIyQzM3LkM0NkQlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDgyNzIxMzcwNi4wMWMyMDJiMEBwb3AuaXNsYW5kbmV0LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":42329,"nextInTopic":42367,"prevInTime":42356,"nextInTime":42358,"topicId":42171,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The kids went bird-watching, <br/>\nand the younger ones would figure out from the pictures which bird they <br/>\nwere looking at.  Then they would take the book to their sister to have her <br/>\nread the details.  The non-readers remembered all those details.  The <br/>\nreader didn&#39;t.
