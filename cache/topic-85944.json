The hoop petticoats she<br/>\nused are not authentic since they are made of lighter, flexible, modern<br/>\nnylon boning instead of whalebone or steel. However the method she taught<br/>\nthe actors and re-enactors for getting through doors, or into the narrow<br/>\nwings of the theaters is to lean to the side, pick up the bottom most hoop<br/>\nand lift, gathering the hoops together like a roman blind (or those round<br/>\npaper lampshades). You then tuck this under your arm so you have diagonally<br/>\n(almost vertical) concentric circles across your hips, with the other side<br/>\nstill at the ankle. Obviously this displays your legs to a certain point<br/>\nalthough there is usually enough fabric in the skirt to drape over the<br/>\nunderpants area.
