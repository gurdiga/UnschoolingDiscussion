kind of guy, i tend to be a bit<br/>\nless demanding in terms of his rene&#39;s behavior and my hd is a bit more<br/>\nimpatient with the &#39;bad behavior&#39; issues and they fight a lot more.   they<br/>\nhave a lot more power struggles, than rene&#39; and i do.<br/>\n<br/>\ni found this very interesting because even though i&#39;m less demanding<br/>\noverall when i do &#39;lay down the law&#39;, particularly in terms of personally<br/>\nboundaries and things i feel are really important like areas of safety,<br/>\nrene&#39; responds much better to me than his dad.  but i&#39;m also the one who<br/>\nreally listens to him and finds out why he wants or does something.  for<br/>\nexample rene&#39; really wants a gameboy color and without any discussion dh<br/>\nsays: &#39;no way&#39;, which sparked a royal fit from rene&#39;.  i stepped in, got<br/>\nhim to calm down and ask him why he wanted one.  we discuss the cost of the<br/>\ngame itself plus all the cartridges,  we check out, online, all the<br/>\ndifferent machines available (sega, sony etc.) the cost each one and what<br/>\ngames are played on which machines.   then i told him what my concerns are<br/>\nabout buying him one etc.  we have yet to buy one though he still wants one<br/>\nand periodically asks (or should i say &#39;reminds&#39; us) but he also feels<br/>\nheard and his position is respected so no more fits and its been about 6<br/>\nmonths.  now this didn&#39;t happen in a day it took a good month of talking<br/>\nand frustrating visits to park day, where the older kids had them and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t share, but after that his &#39;obsession&#39; has progressively lessened.<br/>\n<br/>\nanother example i have which has to do with math:  rene&#39; happens to love it<br/>\n(mind you he is only 4) and we have a math cd-rom by dk &#39;counting and<br/>\nsorting&#39;.  anyway he wanted to get mega math blaster and i said sure when<br/>\nyou finish all the levels of the other cd.  he agreed and sat down and<br/>\nwithin an hour he hated math, was angry and frustrated and i realized in a<br/>\nmoment i had destroyed his natural love for math and turned what use to be<br/>\nfun into &#39;work&#39;.  so we bought him the other cd.  he now plays both and<br/>\nloves math again.  i&#39;m not suggestion to buy anything or give in to every<br/>\ndemand but i just think there is a way to honor both you and your values<br/>\nwithout shutting your kids desires out.  like what kim said about trusting<br/>\nin your kids as having some reason for doing what they&#39;re doing even if it<br/>\nappears to us as a &#39;waste of time&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\ni think love of learning and curiosity are what should be fostered not<br/>\nparticular skills.   i know that skills are or can be useful but math is so<br/>\nversatile can&#39;t you set up a situation to have your kids learn in a context<br/>\nthey find interesting.  i&#39;m certainly not the one to give any advise<br/>\nbecause i&#39;ve not had to cross that bridge, at least from the parents<br/>\nperspective:) but i have learned when you take the fun out and remove the<br/>\nfree will, you deny the kids the wonderful opportunity of discovery as well<br/>\nas the joy of cooperation and choice.  i don&#39;t know if this is the kind of<br/>\nthing you&#39;re talking about but if it is there is a book i would recommend<br/>\ngiving the love that heals by harville hendrix & helen hunt.  a central<br/>\ntheme in this book is validation something i thing is very important to<br/>\neveryone and especially our kids.  it&#39;s well worth the read<br/>\n<br/>\nsusan<br/>\naustin,tx<br/>\n<br/>\nBrown wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;

My years of public education creep up on me then and push <br/>\nmy panic button.  I find myself scheming to get them interested and busy with <br/>\nsomething.  sigh...  When will I learn?  Balance is crucial.  They have to <br/>\nfeel that I trust them, but at the same time they need the security of <br/>\nknowing that I am the authority.  When they constantly test me and push the <br/>\nlimits, it usually means that I&#39;ve been overbearing and need to relax a bit.  <br/>\nOf course then I always feel like such a dope!  <br/>\nKIM<br/>\n***runs with scissors***</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"susan","from":"susan &lt;fxfireob@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"tZvV3M_A-MdQuwlWL01lk3Hd2G8vxfgYl9HsC9xWLBdD0V0IA5lPH1tS6Z8BH8cJCIMeULDji5wiR3PorG6VBEg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: keeping balance","postDate":"951217190","msgId":6726,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40MzAuNjcyNi45NTkyNjk3NDdAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6724,"nextInTopic":6731,"prevInTime":6725,"nextInTime":6727,"topicId":6723,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hi kim, i ve had many a day where i end up feeling this way:)  it s nice to know one is not alone  susan austin,tx","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1166654534\">hi kim,<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;ve had many a day where i end up feeling this way:)  it&#39;s nice to know one is<br/>\nnot alone &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nsusan<br/>\naustin,tx<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of course then I always feel like such a dope!<br/>\n&gt; KIM<br/>\n&gt; ***runs with scissors*** </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"susan","from":"susan &lt;fxfireob@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Lq9zOQgwMi1pGKQMF-fBzlkXv0w05qFLDUd6eI1zXOg3Y3nbNKnu73R8fsHbsVUnimQjBdIWQqo05GURG0C-U3E","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"keeping balance","postDate":"951215563","msgId":6723,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40MzAuNjcyMy45NTkyNjk3NDdAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6724,"prevInTime":6722,"nextInTime":6724,"topicId":6723,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hi, i m so far behind on messages but i wanted to make a comment.  when i was in college i minored in education.  one classes i took was called ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1545285714\">hi,<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;m so far behind on messages but i wanted to make a comment.  when i<br/>\nwas in college i minored in education.  one classes i took was called<br/>\npyschopedigogics (sp) and i think the basis of this philosophy is<br/>\npertinent to unschooling.  the core concept is one of &#39;bringing [a<br/>\nchild] to adulthood&#39; and it is seen that to do this one must balance 3<br/>\ncomponents: trust, understanding and authority.  so if a problem arises<br/>\nit is because one (or more) of these is being neglected or abused.<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;ve used this as a foundation, a kind of philosophical safety net,<br/>\nparticularly for those bad days when all that &#39;training&#39; and &#39;role<br/>\nmodeling&#39; rears it ugly little head threatening our happy home:)<br/>\nrene&#39;, who is 4, is very independent, he backs down to no one (at park<br/>\ndays he has butted heads with boys more than twice his age  and twice<br/>\nhis size (who are bullying him and others) - he has a keen sense of<br/>\ninjustice and will fight anyone&#39;s battles) in fact arguing happens to be<br/>\none of his favorite sports and will always provide him with a good<br/>\nlaugh:)   that&#39;s just the kind of person he is, a leader type with a<br/>\nstrong independent mind who wants his voice to be heard- which i both<br/>\nlike and drives me crazy:)  he will accept nothing on face value which<br/>\nas an adult will serve him well, but as a parent to him i must back up<br/>\neverything i say and do- so i fall back on the importance of<br/>\nunderstanding him as being paramount instead of wanting him to &#39;just be<br/>\nobedient&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhen i make understanding him vital, he seems to relax more and<br/>\nnaturally trust me.  i believe it&#39;s because of this trust that he is<br/>\nable to respect my authority on issues that our outside his control<br/>\n(i.e. you must brush your teeth or don&#39;t throw the ball at the windows<br/>\nor in the house for that matter &lt;g&gt;).  i truly believe the more i make<br/>\nhonest efforts to understand him, the more he trusts me, the more he<br/>\nrespects my authority.  i also believe this will pave the way for a ease<br/>\nof transition for him to accept more and more authority over his own<br/>\nlife creating an environment where what was once a dynamic between<br/>\nparent and child will then be fully internalized i.e. rene&#39; will embody<br/>\nthis balance of trust understanding and authority within himself,<br/>\ngiving him the skills to be an independent adult.<br/>\n<br/>\ni would be curious what other think about this idea of balancing these 3<br/>\ncomponents.  it seems to work for rene&#39; but would it work for someone of<br/>\na different personality?
