(The thoughtful ones, at least, as opposed to the social and<br/>\ncultural ones who are Christian just because it&#39;s familiar.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey think about it. They discuss it. They read about it. They come to their<br/>\nown conclusions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s pretty much the way scientists develop theories. They gather all the<br/>\ninformation and look for patterns emerging and develop theories on the whys<br/>\nand whats causing the patterns. As more information comes in, sometimes a<br/>\nnew pattern emerges and a new theory can be formulated. (Rarely completely<br/>\nnew, but a better and clearer understanding.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the difference between knowing the answer already exists and knowing<br/>\nthat we don&#39;t know enough to know the ultimate answer but have the ability<br/>\n-- and often the need and drive -- to get as close as we can with what we<br/>\nknow. It&#39;s needing to understand even while knowing that we can&#39;t be sure<br/>\nwe&#39;re right.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t you do the same with parenting and unschooling? There is no Bible for<br/>\neither but you&#39;re still driven to figure out what is truth for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How would I know if I should believe in heaven or God at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a question that&#39;s been asked for eternity!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut why do you phrase it as &quot;should&quot;? As though it were some form of cosmic<br/>\netiquette?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think most nonliteralist Christians, as well as thoughtful believers in<br/>\nother faiths, believe what they do because it feels right in their hearts<br/>\nand their heads and their whole being. And, come to think of it, it applies<br/>\nto atheists too!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And would I even be able to call myself a Christian anymore,<br/>\n&gt; because what would I know to be true about Christ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is that ultimately what Christ wants? For you to know what&#39;s true?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you ended up honestly and heartfeltfully believing something that<br/>\nwas wrong? What would happen here on earth? What would happen afterwards?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think for nonliteralist Christians, the answer is God knows their hearts<br/>\nand knows who is doing the best they can. I think for the nonliterlist, the<br/>\nquest *isn&#39;t* to figure out what God wants them to do. They already know God<br/>\nwants them to be good (to each other and themselves).

It is a <br/>\nvery legalistic, cult-like church and they were taught (both by the way they <br/>\nwere raised and church ideas) that spanking was good and right.<br/>\nFunny thing is, they never felt a need to spank me up until I was three and <br/>\nsome of the ministers pointed out that I was too &quot;self willed&quot; and they <br/>\nshould spank me.<br/>\nThere was a lot of pressure from folks and they succumbed. They thought they <br/>\nwere doing the right thing. So these things DO sway people to do differently <br/>\nthan their instinct dictates.<br/>\nChurch is often about fitting in, not rocking the boat, so you&#39;re going to <br/>\nhave people more receptive to adhering to leadership views.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy folks later had horrible guilt for the spankings foisted upon all of us <br/>\nand begged us not to spank our own. So far, all three of the biological <br/>\nsiblings don&#39;t believe in spanking.<br/>\nOne sister has a very little one, just 1.5 y.o. and is using time out <br/>\noccasionally, so she still doesn&#39;t see all the options available, but it&#39;s <br/>\ngotten better with each generation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>\npeople--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.
