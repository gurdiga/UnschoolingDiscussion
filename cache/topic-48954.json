Definitely.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides math, there&#39;s all those good money management skills!  Tim got<br/>\ntotally into money when we came to Germany because there was so much more of<br/>\nit in his life.  2 kinds, deutsche marks and dollars, and these euros that<br/>\nwere coming but not here yet, but we keps seeing signs about.  Now he&#39;s<br/>\ncollecting coins.  It was as natural as breathing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, being a kid, he wants things he doesn&#39;t have the money for, and<br/>\nborrows from the bank of Mom sometimes.  He&#39;s learned to pay off debts, and<br/>\nthat got us into &quot;how do I write that&quot;, because he&#39;s recording his money for<br/>\na scout project.  Writing that gets you into negative numbers, which I&#39;ve<br/>\nalways liked, just because they were called irrational numbers.
