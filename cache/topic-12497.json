It applies to all 50 states.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACT&quot;<br/>\n  The Public Law 100-294<br/>\n<br/>\n  Defines child abuse and neglect as being any physical or mental injury,<br/>\nact of sexual abuse or exploitation, negligent treatment, or maltreatment<br/>\nof any child under the age of 18, unless the child protection law of the<br/>\nState in, which the child resides specifies a younger age for cases not<br/>\ninvolving sexual abuse, by a person, including any employee of a<br/>\nresidential facility or any staff person providing out-of- home care, who<br/>\nis responsible for the child&#39;s welfare under circumstances, which indicate<br/>\nthat the child&#39;s health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The Act defines sexual abuse as: the use, employment, persuasion,<br/>\ninducement, enticement or coercion of any child to engage in, or assist any<br/>\nother person to engage in, any sexually explicit conduct (or any simulation<br/>\nof such conduct) for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such<br/>\nconduct, or rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual<br/>\nexploitation of children, or incest with children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  1984 Child Abuse Amendments of (P.L. 98-457)<br/>\n<br/>\n  As a result of the above amendment to the Child Abuse Act, the act now<br/>\nalso includes the withholding of medically indicated treatment for an<br/>\ninfant&#39;s life-threatening conditions as child abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  WHAT IS MALTREATMENT ?<br/>\n<br/>\n  The following categories basically all fit under the heading<br/>\nMaltreatment:<br/>\n<br/>\n  PHYSICAL ABUSE<br/>\n<br/>\n  Physical abuse is defined by inflicting any type of physical injury by<br/>\npunching, slapping, hitting, beating, kicking, biting, arm twisting, hair<br/>\npulling, burning, or otherwise harming a child. The parent or care giver<br/>\nmay not have intended to hurt the child and injury may have resulted from<br/>\nover-discipline or physical punishment that is inappropriate to the child&#39;s<br/>\nage. However, it is still abuse. Any physical act causing harm to a child<br/>\nis abuse whether it was intended or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n  CHILD NEGLECT<br/>\n<br/>\n  Child neglect is defined by failure on the parents or care givers part to<br/>\nprovide for the child&#39;s basic needs, food, water, shelter, clothing and so<br/>\non. Child neglect can be a combination of the following: physical,<br/>\neducational, or emotional or can be just one alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The latest national incidence study defines these three types of neglect<br/>\nas follows.<br/>\n<br/>\n  PHYSICAL NEGLECT<br/>\n<br/>\n  Physical neglect includes refusal of or delay in seeking health care or<br/>\nemergency medical services, abandonment, kicking an under aged child out of<br/>\nthe home. Not allowing a runaway to return home. Inadequate supervision,<br/>\nleaving the child unattended for long periods of time. Leaving an under<br/>\naged child home alone to be responsible for younger siblings.<br/>\n<br/>\n  EDUCATIONAL NEGLECT<br/>\n<br/>\n  Educational neglect includes allowing your school aged child to commit<br/>\nthe act of chronic truancy, failure to enroll a child of mandatory school<br/>\nage, every child has the right to education and should be in school<br/>\naccording to your states guidelines. Inattention to a special educational<br/>\nneed, such as knowing your child is in need of special education classes<br/>\nand doing nothing about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  EMOTIONAL NEGLECT<br/>\n<br/>\n  Emotional neglect includes such actions as chronic or extreme spouse<br/>\nabuse in the child&#39;s presence. Knowledge of drug or alcohol use by the<br/>\nchild, or permission. Refusal of or failure to allow or provide needed<br/>\npsychological care.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is extremely important to distinguish between willful neglect and a<br/>\nparent&#39;s or caretaker&#39;s failure to provide necessities of life because of<br/>\npoverty or cultural norms. Say for example, willful neglect is acts that<br/>\ncall for Child Protective Services intervention. Whereas, if a parent who<br/>\nis unable to provide the necessities of life due to poverty may, instead,<br/>\nseek assistance from the governmental agencies charged with providing<br/>\nfinancial assistance, health services, housing, or other basic services.<br/>\n<br/>\n  EMOTIONAL ABUSE<br/>\n<br/>\n  Emotional abuse includes but is not limited to: Screaming, yelling,<br/>\nbelittling, name calling, emotional detachment, lack of love and affection,<br/>\nscapegoating, such as blaming the child for the adults problems or<br/>\nfinancial state.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As you&#39;ve seen there are many forms of child maltreatment more often than<br/>\nnot we find them occurring in combinations. Emotional/psychological will<br/>\nmost likely always be present as well. Emotional abuse and neglect includes<br/>\nacts or omissions by the parents, guardians or any other person responsible<br/>\nfor the child&#39;s care that have caused, or could possibly cause, serious<br/>\nbehavioral, emotional, or mental disorders.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In some cases of emotional/psychological abuse the acts of parents or<br/>\nother caretakers alone, without any harm evident in the child&#39;s behavior or<br/>\ncondition, such as parents, guardian or care givers use excessive, extreme<br/>\neven sometimes bizarre forms of punishment, such as torture, or locking a<br/>\nchild in a dark closet. These also are sufficient to warrant the<br/>\nintervention of Child Protective Services.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n        LinkExchange Member Free Home Pages at GeoCities <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please be kind and sign the guest book before leaving. <br/>\n<br/>\n         <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  This page was updated on: 29 June 1997<br/>\n<br/>\n  What Is Child Abuse & Neglect® is a trademark of CAWSCORP, Inc.<br/>\n  Copyright 1997.

It applies to all 50 \n  states.</font></p><br><br>\n  <center>\n  <p><b><font color=\"#00ff40\" size=\"+3\">&quot;CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT \n  ACT&quot;</font><br><font size=\"+2\">The Public Law 100-294</font></b></p></center>\n  <p><b><font size=\"+1\">Defines child abuse and neglect as being any physical or \n  mental injury, act of sexual abuse or exploitation, negligent treatment, or \n  maltreatment of any child under the age of 18, unless the child protection law \n  of the State in, which the child resides specifies a younger age for cases not \n  involving sexual abuse, by a person, including any employee of a residential \n  facility or any staff person providing out-of- home care, who is responsible \n  for the child&#39;s welfare under circumstances, which indicate that the child&#39;s \n  health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby.</font></b></p>\n  <p><b><font size=\"+1\">The Act defines sexual abuse as: the use, employment, \n  persuasion, inducement, enticement or coercion of any child to engage in, or \n  assist any other person to engage in, any sexually explicit conduct (or any \n  simulation of such conduct) for the purpose of producing any visual depiction \n  of such conduct, or rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual \n  exploitation of children, or incest with children.</font></b></p><br><br>\n  <p>\n  <center><b><font color=\"#00ff40\" size=\"+3\">1984 Child Abuse Amendments of (P.L. \n  98-457)</font></b></center>\n  <p></p>\n  <p><b><font size=\"+1\">As a result of the above amendment to the Child Abuse Act, \n  the act now also includes the withholding of medically indicated treatment for \n  an infant&#39;s life-threatening conditions as child abuse.</font></b></p>\n  <p>\n  <center><b><font color=\"#00ff40\" size=\"+3\">WHAT IS MALTREATMENT \n  ?</font></b></center>\n  <p></p>\n  <p><b><font size=\"+1\">The following categories basically all fit under the \n  heading Maltreatment:</font></b></p>\n  <center>\n  <p><b><font color=\"#ff0080\" size=\"+2\">PHYSICAL ABUSE</font></b></p></center>\n  <p><b><font size=\"+1\">Physical abuse is defined by inflicting any type of \n  physical injury by punching, slapping, hitting, beating, kicking, biting, arm \n  twisting, hair pulling, burning, or otherwise harming a child. The parent or \n  care giver may not have intended to hurt the child and injury may have \n  resulted from over-discipline or physical punishment that is inappropriate to \n  the child&#39;s age. However, it is still abuse. Any physical act causing harm to \n  a child is abuse whether it was intended or not.</font></b></p>\n  <center>\n  <p><b><font color=\"#ff0080\" size=\"+2\">CHILD NEGLECT</font></b></p></center>\n  <p><b><font size=\"+1\">Child neglect is defined by failure on the parents or care \n  givers part to provide for the child&#39;s basic needs, food, water, shelter, \n  clothing and so on. Child neglect can be a combination of the following: \n  physical, educational, or emotional or can be just one alone.</font></b></p>\n  <p><b><font size=\"+1\">The latest national incidence study defines these three \n  types of neglect as follows.</font></b></p>\n  <center>\n  <p><b><font color=\"#ff0080\" size=\"+2\">PHYSICAL NEGLECT</font></b></p></center>\n  <p><b><font size=\"+1\">Physical neglect includes refusal of or delay in seeking \n  health care or emergency medical services, abandonment, kicking an under aged \n  child out of the home. Not allowing a runaway to return home. Inadequate \n  supervision, leaving the child unattended for long periods of time. Leaving an \n  under aged child home alone to be responsible for younger \n  siblings.</font></b></p>\n  <center>\n  <p><b><font color=\"#ff0080\" size=\"+2\">EDUCATIONAL NEGLECT</font></b></p></center>\n  <p><b><font size=\"+1\">Educational neglect includes allowing your school aged \n  child to commit the act of chronic truancy, failure to enroll a child of \n  mandatory school age, every child has the right to education and should be in \n  school according to your states guidelines. Inattention to a special \n  educational need, such as knowing your child is in need of special education \n  classes and doing nothing about it.</font></b></p>\n  <center>\n  <p><b><font color=\"#ff0080\" size=\"+2\">EMOTIONAL NEGLECT</font></b></p></center>\n  <p><b><font size=\"+1\">Emotional neglect includes such actions as chronic or \n  extreme spouse abuse in the child&#39;s presence. Knowledge of drug or alcohol use \n  by the child, or permission. Refusal of or failure to allow or provide needed \n  psychological care.</font></b></p>\n  <p><b><font size=\"+1\">It is extremely important to distinguish between willful \n  neglect and a parent&#39;s or caretaker&#39;s failure to provide necessities of life \n  because of poverty or cultural norms. Say for example, willful neglect is acts \n  that call for Child Protective Services intervention. Whereas, if a parent who \n  is unable to provide the necessities of life due to poverty may, instead, seek \n  assistance from the governmental agencies charged with providing financial \n  assistance, health services, housing, or other basic services.</font></b></p>\n  <center>\n  <p><b><font color=\"#ff0080\" size=\"+2\">EMOTIONAL ABUSE</font></b></p></center>\n  <p><b><font size=\"+1\">Emotional abuse includes but is not limited to: Screaming, \n  yelling, belittling, name calling, emotional detachment, lack of love and \n  affection, scapegoating, such as blaming the child for the adults problems or \n  financial state.</font></b></p>\n  <p><b><font size=\"+1\">As you&#39;ve seen there are many forms of child maltreatment \n  more often than not we find them occurring in combinations. \n  Emotional/psychological will most likely always be present as well. Emotional \n  abuse and neglect includes acts or omissions by the parents, guardians or any \n  other person responsible for the child&#39;s care that have caused, or could \n  possibly cause, serious behavioral, emotional, or mental \n  disorders.</font></b></p>\n  <p><b><font size=\"+1\">In some cases of emotional/psychological abuse the acts of \n  parents or other caretakers alone, without any harm evident in the child&#39;s \n  behavior or condition, such as parents, guardian or care givers use excessive, \n  extreme even sometimes bizarre forms of punishment, such as torture, or \n  locking a child in a dark closet. These also are sufficient to warrant the \n  intervention of Child Protective Services.</font></b></p>\n  <p>\n  <center><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ad.linkexchange.com/2/X295163/gotoad.map\"><img\n alt=\"LinkExchange\" border=\"1\" height=\"40\"\n isMap src=\"https://ec.yimg.com/ec?url=http%3A%2F%2Fad.linkexchange.com%2F2%2FX295163%2Flogoshowad%3Ffree&t=1571750595&sig=l6Eksyg_6DAu4udN6mUOkg--~E\" width=\"440\"></a> <br>\n  <table border=\"0\" width=\"440\">\n    <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"left\"><font size=\"1\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.linkexchange.com/\"\n>LinkExchange Member</a></font></td>\n      <td align=\"right\"><font size=\"1\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/\"\n>Free Home Pages at \n  GeoCities</a></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br></center>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>\n  <center><b>Please be kind and sign the guest book before leaving.</b> \n  <p></p>\n  <p>\n  <table cellPadding=\"0\" cellSpacing=\"0\" width=\"300\">\n    <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th align=\"middle\"><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.Lpage.com/wgb/wgbsign.dbm?owner=cawscorp\"><img\n height=\"62\" src=\"https://ec.yimg.com/ec?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geocities.com%2FCapitolHill%2F7836%2Fguestb.jpg&t=1571750595&sig=M0M2pL1VKr7LepXn8nlLgw--~E\"\n width=\"148\"></a></th>\n      <th align=\"middle\"><img height=\"62\"\n src=\"https://ec.yimg.com/ec?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geocities.com%2FCapitolHill%2F7836%2Fguestbk.gif&t=1571750595&sig=ZQmILq6ke.0aNNfg.V3Ytw--~E\"\n width=\"148\"></th>\n      <th align=\"middle\"><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lpage.com/wgb/wgbview.dbm?owner=cawscorp\"><img\n height=\"62\" src=\"https://ec.yimg.com/ec?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geocities.com%2FCapitolHill%2F7836%2Fguestc.jpg&t=1571750595&sig=jZtKUB1L8WeA4Y4rbS1SHg--~E\"\n width=\"148\"></a></th></tr></tbody></table></p>\n  <p><b>This page was updated on: 29 June 1997</b></p>\n  <p><b>What Is Child Abuse &amp; Neglect® is a trademark of CAWSCORP, \n  Inc.<br>Copyright 1997.
