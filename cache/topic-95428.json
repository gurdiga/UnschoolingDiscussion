No one is required to do much<br/>\nof anything but there are certain requirements that are expected to be met<br/>\nfor certain activities.  Example:  To be an officer, you are expected to<br/>\nattend a leadership camp and complete a record book.  Doesn&#39;t mean you get<br/>\nkicked off for not doing it, just that it is expected.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trouble we had with the very younger kids and the older kids mixed<br/>\ntogether is that the younger kids would get bored and want to do something<br/>\nelse before the big kids were or that the big kids wanted to do things at a<br/>\ndeeper level than the younger kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur clover kids has no curriculum.
