It will help tremendously in explaining to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;educator&quot; type family & friends why we don&#39;t want to send our kids to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; school.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I went to search for this book on Amazon and could not find it. Is this the<br/>\n&gt; correct title? Any hints on where I can find it? I liked his other book,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot; and would be interested to read this one if I could get my<br/>\n&gt; hands on it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks very much, Ashley Harvie, mom to Willis, 5, and Frances, 2<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is because it&#39;s not published yet.
