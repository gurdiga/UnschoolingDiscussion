Her sister had built a den the year before and the<br/>\nalpha female forced her out.   After the alpha female&#39;s death (murder)<br/>\nher sister began moving her pups into the alpha den.   In wolf packs only<br/>\nthe alpha pair is the breeding pair.  There was insubordination in the<br/>\nranks. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not about rejecting hierarchy. <br/>\n<br/>\nLone wolves might survive for awhile on small pray, but it takes a pack,<br/>\ncooperation, to bring down large prey.   Lone wolves aren&#39;t the norm. <br/>\nNeither are lone humans.   Lone wolves, if they live long enough will<br/>\nform a new pack (where hierarchy exists) or join another pack.   Lone<br/>\nhumans sometimes turn out to be Ted Kaczynski types.   <br/>\n<br/>\nEven unschoolers who feel isolated seek out other unschoolers on message<br/>\nboards and e-mail lists.
