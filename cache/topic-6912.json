The next meeting is this <br/>\nFriday. We did have a discussion about the two types of SCA people, <br/>\nthe authenticity mavens and the &quot;hey,let&#39;s party&quot; crowd. They did <br/>\nemphasize that it kind of misses the point to attend without getting <br/>\ninto the authentic aspect of it. Everyone does it for fun of course <br/>\nbut you must respect the original intent of the group.<br/>\n<br/>\n We went to a couple of tournaments this last spring and met the <br/>\nBaroness of Calafia at one of them. She told us we should attend a <br/>\nwar before we decided if we really wanted to get into the SCA. We <br/>\nattended the Potrero War over Memorial Day weekend and had a great <br/>\ntime. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that during the longer events like a war there are more <br/>\nopportunities for learning and participating, for kids and adults. <br/>\nWe learned so much just from the merchants alone. There was a guy <br/>\nthat was selling woven belts and looms and primitive weaving <br/>\ninstruments and he was also giving classes on ropemaking at specific <br/>\ntimes. When we approached him and expressed an interest in what he <br/>\ndid, he was happy to talk about his craft and he showed the kids and <br/>\nI some simple weaving/ropemaking techniques right then. We had <br/>\nsimilar experiences with the natural fabric dye people, the middle-<br/>\neastern drum guy, the belly dancer ladies, the guy that was making <br/>\narrows by hand, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids also had a great time boffer fighting with lots of other <br/>\nkids, free roaming, no rules and they were fine. Occasinally one of <br/>\nthe adult fighters would be around to show some technique or even <br/>\njoin them, but mostly the kids did a great job of governing <br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne night I went back to our campsite for a while and the kids were <br/>\noff with some of their new-found friends. I caught up with them a <br/>\ncouple of hours later and they had been to a dance and learned 3 <br/>\nfolk dances.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the day we watched some of the fighting and it was much more <br/>\nexciting than a tournament. My son was very interested in the <br/>\ntrebuchet and since then we have been researching and planning to <br/>\nbuild one. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter and I plan on joining the costumers guild. I understand <br/>\nthat they have a place to meet once a week and large tables for <br/>\ncutting fabric and good sewing machines that we can use. We have <br/>\nbeen doing some research on the internet and at the library on <br/>\nperiod costumes. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is interested in making his own armor. I am hoping that he <br/>\ncan join the armorers guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want a great authentic SCA experience for you and your family <br/>\nI think you can make it happen. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you want a great SCA experience for all the INTERESTED kids in <br/>\nyour (our) Barony, I have an idea.  What about inviting different <br/>\nguilds to do demonstrations of their crafts at events? Preview what <br/>\nthey are going to do and come up with different things that the kids <br/>\ncan do depending on their age. Encourage the guilds to point out <br/>\nthat they are open to all SCA members and would be happy to instruct <br/>\nnew people that are truly interested in their work. It doesn&#39;t have <br/>\nto be kid only, just kid friendly. Faciltate the kids hooking up <br/>\nwith the adults that share their interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the crafts are more compelling if they are grown-up, <br/>\nauthentic things. Making a banner is more interesting if you have a <br/>\nreal herald there showing you what some of the symbols mean, <br/>\naccurate color combinations and layouts and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been my experience that if you get someone that is passionate <br/>\nabout what they are doing, they are happy to talk about it and show <br/>\nothers how to get started. Their enthusiasm makes them interesting <br/>\nto learn from. I think there are many like that in the SCA.<br/>\n <br/>\nHow about planning a simple authentic dish (food) that the kids can <br/>\nmake? Gently show the kids that being authentic is what it&#39;s all <br/>\nabout. Maybe the kids can influence some of the not-so-authentic <br/>\nparents to be more-so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am new, so this is just my idea of how it COULD be. How I hope it <br/>\nwill be. So far we have had a great time but I can see how people <br/>\ncould be lazy and attend with a different attutude. We won&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents.

I have been very impressed with the way the list is handled. I <br/>\nlike seeing people be able to debate but end the silly jibes when it gets to <br/>\nthat level. I am addressing this topic because I do have some insight into the <br/>\nworld of &quot;medievel period living&quot;. Before I ever joined SCA, and then quickly <br/>\n&quot;unjoined&quot;, I worked for 2 years at the Ren Faire in Colorado. I was the dead <br/>\nfish trainer. If you want to know more about that let me know but I want to get <br/>\nto my view.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you all know, a title does not an organization make. Although SCA is <br/>\nsupposed to be against all things &quot;mundane&quot; (boffer not being a word used when I <br/>\nwas there 12 years ago), if the people in the group choose to allow Gameboys and <br/>\nplastic toys, they pretty blew the whole point. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my own experience, if you would like the children to really be exposed to <br/>\nthe land of Knights and Kings, see where your closest Ren Faire is held. Get <br/>\nahold of the director and ask if you could be a part of it. Although most <br/>\nfaires require auditions, if you are willing to work for free or even hire one or <br/>\ntwo of the regular participants, you will most likely get the &quot;in&quot; you need to <br/>\ntruly explore the world of jousting and courting and all the rest. Even if <br/>\nyour nearest faire site has been opened and closed its gates already, it is <br/>\nhighly likely that several of the people who work the faire are local. Although <br/>\nmost of the merchants and large acts travel from state to state, some of them <br/>\nonly work the one faire with regular &quot;mundane&quot; jobs keeping them home. I <br/>\nguarantee that once you have met a few of them and proven your interest, you will be <br/>\nintroduced to all the learning you can handle. Many of the faires require that <br/>\nthe goods sold onsite are made with only the materials and level of technology <br/>\navailable during that period in history. California is especially known for <br/>\nthe authenticity of it&#39;s players, dress and goods. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the whole, I believe that you will find that Ren people are generous, <br/>\nopen, and eager to teach anyone who wants to learn. And they are also a group that <br/>\nI would consider an assortment of unschooling families. Rather like modern <br/>\nday gypsies, the ones that travel all year take their children with them and <br/>\nteach them on the road.

They <br/>\ndon&#39;t dwell too much on the not so great stuff, but it can help give some <br/>\nperspective when you have to hit the library.<br/>\n<br/>\nSCA is very fighting oriented, which is indeed, the pivotal part of that <br/>\ntime, but I feel that if you are interested in more one on one experiences as well <br/>\nas a more rounded experience as a whole, the Ren Faires are your best source.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course this is just my opinion, LOL! <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note, we just got back from a trip visiting the inlaws in Las Vegas <br/>\nand stayed at the Excaliber and saw the &quot;Tournament of Kings&quot; with wonderful <br/>\nperformances by all.

Most of <br/>\nour events are single-day tournaments, and this is what I have <br/>\nwitnessed. Many in our area have no chosen persona, or don&#39;t function <br/>\nwithin it. Garb is showy but in many cases, inaccurate. Kids aren&#39;t <br/>\nalways garbed in any case. Tournaments are 99.9% of the time fought <br/>\n&quot;standard double elimination&quot;, there is not much to learn there (plus <br/>\nit has no historical precedent, from what I have gathered). Lunch is <br/>\nfrequently Burger King (not MY lunch, but the stuff you frequently see <br/>\npeople eating at an event - except in my own Barony where my Baroness <br/>\nis an EXCELLENT cook and frequently offers a lunch - but that&#39;s not the <br/>\nnorm at all events). There&#39;s not much for anyone to learn FROM. It&#39;s <br/>\nlargely a dress-up party in the park. Maybe it&#39;s one of those <br/>\ndownswings, but how would we know? I agree in theory, this should be a <br/>\nGREAT place for this, to soak up atmosphere if nothing else, but the <br/>\nreality is, at the events I have attended, it just doesn&#39;t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If children are in and about the grownups they came with, they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; learning from the conversations they&#39;re hearing, the people they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; meeting, the work<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re doing.  If children are isolated in kid-land, they will learn <br/>\n&gt; that children should be isolated, that they&#39;re not really part of the <br/>\n&gt; event.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They aren&#39;t a part of things anyway tho, and I agree it&#39;s not <br/>\nappropriate. The conversations are not (from what I have heard) <br/>\nanything medievally related, they&#39;re about work and traffic and partly <br/>\nabout SCA matters (which officers didn&#39;t come to xxx meeting, that sort <br/>\nof thing), but not &quot;persona&quot; matters (I know those conversations would <br/>\nhave some value also, but they aren&#39;t exclusive to the SCA). At least <br/>\nin &quot;kid-land&quot; (LOL) they ARE learning and exploring and playing, if <br/>\nthey choose to. They don&#39;t have to come to where I am, they WANT to (or <br/>\nare possibly coerced by their parents, or provided no other options). <br/>\nI&#39;ve had kids (7-10 yr old age range, and older) who don&#39;t even know <br/>\ntheir own mom and dad&#39;s SCA names, or what Barony they are from, or in <br/>\nsome cases, their OWN SCA name, if they even have one, what time period <br/>\ntheir garb is from, or any other number of things you&#39;d think they <br/>\nmight have picked up from their adults, if the adults were discussing <br/>\nthem. And FYI in our area (I know this varies), we&#39;re not really <br/>\n*isolated* as such, we&#39;re in one of the many sunshades parked around <br/>\nthe eric, we&#39;re not off in some corner or a separate room or something <br/>\n(I know we&#39;re still apart, but we might be right next to the Baronial <br/>\npavilion for instance, we&#39;re not in some way-off spot). And I don&#39;t run <br/>\na timed program, so kids do come and go and presumably spend at least <br/>\nsome time with their adults, tho I don&#39;t keep track of where they are <br/>\nwhen they are not with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are of course exceptions and some wonderful people and some <br/>\nevents with things to do and learn, actively and passively.
