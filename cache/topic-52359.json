I DO like battle scenes. I try <br/>\nto put myself there. It&#39;s horribly gory and bloody. Of course, I always say <br/>\nI&#39;d be the one pretending to have been hit and lying VERY still until it was <br/>\nover. (Totally worthless in war!) We visited Gettysburg and Petersburg; I can <br/>\njust imagine the scenes! I loved the Burn&#39;s series and the movie made out of <br/>\nThe Killer Angels. The Patriot (filmed here in Camden). Braveheart. WWII and <br/>\nNapoleanic reinactments. I&#39;m not as wild about the VietNam war--that creeps <br/>\nme out. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe glorified parts of war are completely out of my grasp---but the realities <br/>\nhit SO close. I can smell the rotting flesh and the blood and taste the <br/>\nmetallic air. I can feel the snow or the sun. And hear the voices. The <br/>\nbattlefields of VA are hauntingly &quot;THERE&quot;.  But I felt the same in Dachau. <br/>\n(Been there yet, Brenda? It&#39;s a trip you&#39;ll never forget!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s the chick flick KING! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52347,"nextTopicId":52357}}
