These trees are very tall.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were watching these guys do their job and they were incredible!  Very entertaining too.  They were swinging from tree to tree, climbing up and down, STANDING on TOP of a six inch diameter tree that was probably 30 feet high with only the safety belt...no bucket.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we went out with the video camera, one of the trees was topped off, the guy who cut it (who was still standing at the top of the remaining tree) did the &quot;woo hoo&quot; dance and was shaking his booty around.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son&#39;s back was to me, and I said, I bet your thinking about *this* for a job!  He turned around and had a gleam in his eye.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe would TOTALLY fit in with them.  These guys are a riot.  There they are with a chain saw attatched to their belts, a cigarette in their mouths, 30 feet in the air as though its nothing.  They were even climbing our rope swing just for fun.  It was almost like they were putting on their own show....sort of like Stomp.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have a great sense of humor, are very friendly, and easy to talk to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just *know* this is probably what he&#39;ll do...or something very much like it.  It just &quot;clicked&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey make pretty good money too and no college required :o).  I asked the guys how old a person had to be to do this work, and they said &quot;well you don&#39;t want to be *too* old LOL&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I figure, when you&#39;re tired of climbing, you just own your own business and supervise the younger guys hee hee.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92299,"nextTopicId":92312}}
