Get more out of your creative time with these craft tips from <br/>\n&quot;i-craft.com&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The less time you spend correcting mistakes or fussing with set-up and <br/>\nclean-up, the more pleasure you get!&quot; www.i-craft.com has some great &quot;craft&quot; <br/>\nideas and tips for working with children. Here are just a few:<br/>\n<br/>\n· Remember this adage: clean hands, clean project.<br/>\n· Use plastic party table covers for messy crafts. They protect better than <br/>\nnewspaper and can be used more than once.<br/>\n· When working with cardboard and glue, lightly wet the underside of the <br/>\ncardboard and it will dry flat.<br/>\n· Prevent paper from ripping when affixing tape by applying the tape to <br/>\nclothing first to reduce its stickiness.<br/>\n· Cut Styrofoam® by using a serrated knife well waxed with a candle stub or <br/>\nparaffin.<br/>\n· Heat from a blow drier causes strings of hot glue to disintegrate <br/>\nimmediately.<br/>\n· When doing decoupage, use rounded lacquered chopsticks to smooth out any <br/>\nair bubbles or wrinkles after gluing. You can usually find lacquered <br/>\nchopsticks (which are smoother than un-lacquered sticks) in Asian markets or <br/>\ngift shops. <br/>\n· To keep the pattern stationary, have children place a rolled piece of <br/>\nmasking tape between the pattern and the surface to be cut. Cut around <br/>\npattern and surface simultaneously.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile at &quot;i-craft.com&quot; also check out the &quot;Teacher Place&quot; where you&#39;ll find <br/>\n<br/>\n· Creative lesson plans that incorporate crafts with core curriculum <br/>\nsubjects. &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.i-craft.com/teachers/plans00/index.html&quot;\">http://www.i-craft.com/teachers/plans00/index.html&quot;</a>&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.i-craft.com/teachers/plans00/index.html&lt;/A\">http://www.i-craft.com/teachers/plans00/index.html&lt;/A</a>&gt;   · Making the <br/>\nConnection to Project Based Learning in Your Curriculum. &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.i-craft.com/teachers/connect_teachers.pdf&quot;\">http://www.i-craft.com/teachers/connect_teachers.pdf&quot;</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.i-craft.com/teachers/connect_teachers.pdf&lt;/A\">http://www.i-craft.com/teachers/connect_teachers.pdf&lt;/A</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n5.

(FMB)<br/>\n<br/>\nMealtime can provide a great learning opportunity for a child. Consider one <br/>\nof these ideas: <br/>\n<br/>\n· Practice making geometric shapes out of cheese cubes and pretzel sticks. <br/>\nTry making cubes, pyramids or other geometric shapes. For more fun, try <br/>\nmaking a watchtower for a pretzel pirate or a footbridge between two cups.<br/>\n· Create mosaic tile designs out of graham crackers (base), peanut butter <br/>\n(grout), and trail mix, candies or mini-marshmallows (tiles). Sort tiles by <br/>\nsize, color, and shape before creating a design. <br/>\n· Create a modern art sculpture using slices of fruit and/or veggies. Use <br/>\ntoothpicks or skewers (be careful!) to connect pieces together.<br/>\n· Build a sand castle out of pancakes. Use cookie cutters or a butter knife <br/>\nto cut basic shapes. (Add a moat for maple syrup!)<br/>\n· Draw a picture or write your name with cooked spaghetti. When project is <br/>\ncompleted, cover with marinara and dive in. (Don&#39;t forget to slurp!)<br/>\n· Make your own ice cream flavors. Allow vanilla ice cream to soften slightly <br/>\nand divide small portions into disposable bowls. Add a flavor to each bowl <br/>\n(such as candies, cookies, peanut butter, maple syrup, chocolate syrup, <br/>\nstrawberries, mashed banana, etc.) and refreeze. Play ice cream parlor (role <br/>\nplaying) or conduct a taste test (evaluation and comparison) by defining <br/>\ncriteria, creating a <br/>\nsurvey form, and comparing all flavors to pick the best one.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What&#39;s Your Creativity Quotient (C.Q.)?&quot; is sent out once a week.  <br/>\nSubscribers can unsubscribe at anytime.
