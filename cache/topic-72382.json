Today, we finally got to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The fellow as very personable kid-friendly ( no surprise as he is also <br/>\ndog-friendly.. lol)  He is a shuzhund trainer and he spent over 2 hours showing us <br/>\nlots of interesting things.  He talked about dog care, diet, health, etc.  He <br/>\nshowed us some basic obedience training with a pup he is currently training.  <br/>\nHe took us over to a field that he had &quot;laid a track&quot; in and told us all <br/>\nabout tracking dogs and thier jobs, how they track, what they do, ect.  We got a <br/>\nfirst hand experience of watching (and following) his award winning dog track a <br/>\n3 hour old trail.   He showed us how he rewards the dog by playing with him <br/>\nand how the dog obeys so meticulously in order to get to play with his toy.   <br/>\nThen, we went back to his training site and he showed us another dog do some <br/>\nprotection/bite work.  Folks  asked a lot of questions and he was happy to <br/>\nanswer all of them.  He was very patient and thorough with his answers.  The dogs <br/>\nwere amazing and beautiful. <br/>\n<br/>\n  JP got bored about an hour into it as did most of the other kids under 10.  <br/>\n They turned to picking weeds and throwing grass on each other and just <br/>\ngoofing off and playing around.  They dog trainer guy didn&#39;t seem to mind too much, <br/>\nhe still had the adults and a few older kids attention.  Basically, the <br/>\nyounger kids just liked watching the dogs and petting them, they were not very <br/>\ninterested in all the &quot;technical stuff&quot;.   Anna and I learned a lot and really <br/>\nenjoyed the whole trip. <br/>\n<br/>\n I found out that &quot;commercial&quot; or grocery store dog food is basically junk.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s just enough to keep a dog alive with very little nutritional value.  The <br/>\nguy recommended some good brands of dog food ( he uses one called Precise) .  <br/>\nAfter the doggy session, I headed straight to Petsmart to get some &quot;good&quot; dog <br/>\nfood.  I had always bought Purina and though I was doing my dog a favor.. LOL. <br/>\n No such luck, its basically fillers, additives and other no good stuff.   <br/>\nThe knowledgeable ( kinda surprising, lol) salesclerk at Petsmart confirmed what <br/>\nthe trainer had told us about the lack of quality in grocery store dog foods, <br/>\nand she recommended some better brands.  I chucked out $40 for dog food ( <br/>\npuppy and adult),  and a few tennis balls for the puppies to play with   The <br/>\nsalesclerk also confirmed that Pert Plus shampoo can be used on small puppies to <br/>\nkill fleas.  I had read that on the Internet and I asked her about the validity <br/>\nof it.   So, we went off to Wal-mart to throw down another $30 for shampoo, <br/>\nflea comb, and two bales of cedar bedding.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Back home we came to feed the puppies their new fancified dog food, spread <br/>\nthe cedar shavings in the kennel, and give them thier first bath.  Yesterday <br/>\nwe wormed them and thier little tummies were not so bloated out today.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I came in to do some dog food research and found out some NASTY stuff <br/>\ngoes into a lot of dog food. UGHGHGHGH..  I found lots of articles that said <br/>\nbasically the same thing.. Here is a good one  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://siriusdog.com/dogfood.htm&quot;\">http://siriusdog.com/dogfood.htm&quot;</a>&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://siriusdog.com/dogfood.htm&lt;/A\">http://siriusdog.com/dogfood.htm&lt;/A</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that was our &quot;dog day&quot;     Lots of fun and learning too!
