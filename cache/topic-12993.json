I&#39;d add a book I found <br/>\nrecently in our main library in town, The Birth of a Mother, <br/>\nperhaps not one for reading while one&#39;s up to one&#39;s ears in nappies <br/>\nand milk, but a good insight into the psychological processes of <br/>\nbecoming a mother.  Bill and Martha Sears&#39; books sometimes <br/>\nhave off-putting titles like &#39;The Discipline Book,&#39; but they are the <br/>\nmodern &#39;god-parents,&#39; almost, of what we now call attachment <br/>\nparenting.  Their &#39;Baby Book&#39; would be top of my list to give to <br/>\npregnant friends if I wasn&#39;t sure they were intending to <br/>\nbreastfeed, it has a good chapter on bottlefeeding which, by the <br/>\ntime one has read it will make one want to breastfeed!  On the <br/>\nsubject of discipline, I think it&#39;s never too early to start, and by that <br/>\nI mean to take from the Latin roots of &#39;discipline,&#39; which are to do <br/>\nwith leading.  The best discipline, IMO, is respecting one&#39;s child, <br/>\nand as LLL says, &#39;from infancy on, children need loving guidance <br/>\nwhich reflects acceptance of their capabilities and sensitivity to <br/>\ntheir feelings.&#39;  I need this tattoo-ing on the inside of my eyelids I <br/>\nthink!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes for your birth, had a home-birth with no2, was great!<br/>\nTracy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Nicole Brown","from":"Nicole Brown &lt;nbrown@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"yjAuVqxF8EEHlPScMl0NBIZXfRO5UU4INM3WHdsCUhsSALC_nKMQAmR91zxm3d926OnLNGCuJKKDZ-1Hr9MtxjF1gqdLBw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 781","postDate":"968388665","msgId":12993,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5Qjg3MDM5LjgzMTg1REM4QGJidGVsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDk2ODI4NTQ1OC4yMDM0MUBlZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13027,"prevInTime":12992,"nextInTime":12994,"topicId":12993,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, Just wanted to say thanks for the warm welcome and reading suggestions... will definitely check out Dr. Sears and the La Leche League site (I visited it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1246642223\">Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to say thanks for the warm welcome and reading<br/>\nsuggestions... will definitely check out Dr. Sears and the La Leche<br/>\nLeague site (I visited it before, but didn&#39;t notice the reading list I<br/>\nguess... will go back!).

All my cats are on it because one had a<br/>\nnear-fatal bout of FUS a few years ago. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I have to mention re: allergies and yeast infections...<br/>\nespecially when a yeast infection is the result of a course of<br/>\nantibiotics, take acidophilus supplements and/or eat lots of yogurt with<br/>\nlive cultures after the course. It will restore the bacterial balance<br/>\nand (hopefully) prevent the yeast, and you can avoid antifungal drugs.<br/>\nI&#39;ve successfully cured vaginal yeast with dilute yogurt douches, also a<br/>\ncombo of calendula (marigold) tea and vinegar water (using them<br/>\nalternately, not together). <br/>\n<br/>\nTake care!<br/>\n<br/>\nNicole</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12976,"nextTopicId":12977}}
