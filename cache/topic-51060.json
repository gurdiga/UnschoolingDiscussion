They have never <br/>\nasked us about any decisions we&#39;ve made about our lifestyle, they just <br/>\ncriticize. They can&#39;t understand or more simply, just don&#39;t want to. I can <br/>\nhandle people not agreeing with me all day long, but not vocally criticizing <br/>\nme for decisions they know nothing about. My SIL who works in the public <br/>\nschool system is adament about making her kids go to college whether they <br/>\nwant to or not. In her words, you can&#39;t be a success without college. I&#39;ve <br/>\nsat through 13 years of this and pretty much kept my mouth shut when I <br/>\nrealized no one really cared why we made the decisons we did, just that they <br/>\nweren&#39;t what we should do according to them. It wasn&#39;t worth the arguments <br/>\nthat ensued. Keeping quiet didn&#39;t make it go away. Now I simply stay away <br/>\nand so does my husband. Just wasn&#39;t worth it. I&#39;m happier and therefor so is <br/>\nmy family!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow of course my husband is having a change of heart. We just buried his BIL <br/>\nand he wants to take another crack at his family. If he feels like there is <br/>\na chance, I&#39;m willing to do so. But I won&#39;t be keeping quiet this time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the opinions are just their strongly stated ones, I&#39;d keep quiet and let <br/>\nthem talk. If it gets personal and judgemental, I&#39;d say something. Something <br/>\nlike saying you disagree and then asking if they would really like to know <br/>\nwhy should do the trick.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the rant. Sore spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
