Even when they picked up <br/>\nChaucer.  It wasn&#39;t until they met the summoner and the pardoner that <br/>\ni smacked my head and said to DH, &quot;OOHH!!  A KNIGHT&#39;s Tale....  as in <br/>\nCanterbury!!&quot;  ROFL.  I just thought it was a story about a knight, <br/>\nlike Dragonheart of one of those...<br/>\n<br/>\nI can be so SLOW...  ;o)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that&#39;s off topic... so i&#39;ll just add that i really enjoy your <br/>\nconversations regarding unschooling.  Even if i don&#39;t decide to do <br/>\nthat with my son, it will greatly affect how i homeschool and even <br/>\nparent him.  I used to be MUCH more rigid and had high expectations <br/>\nof what he should do/see/say and how he should act, etc...  I&#39;m <br/>\nreally learning to back off.  so, THANK YOU!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly lurking,<br/>\nTATE (41 wks pg)<br/>\n=o)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37310,"nextTopicId":37314}}
