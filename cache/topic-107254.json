I<br/>\nimmediately dismissed him as a nutbar.  Two years<br/>\nlater, I came out of the divorce-induced madness<br/>\nolder, wiser and absolutely amazed and sometimes<br/>\nappalled at the things I did and said during that<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have very clearly stated to my husband what I see as<br/>\npotential problems.  He, after 10 years, doesn&#39;t<br/>\nrealize he&#39;s adorable.  I&#39;m not worried about his<br/>\nreaction to any potential advances.  He thinks she&#39;s<br/>\ncreepy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess we&#39;re both just wanting Ellis to have the<br/>\nopportunity to have a friend.  Our neighbors are all<br/>\nretired and he loves them but there&#39;s a kid shortage. <br/>\nAnd when you eliminate all the abusive and mean ones,<br/>\nthe pool is really shallow.  He&#39;s just not a<br/>\nrun-and-scream type of kid for the most part.  When he<br/>\ngets in those social situations, he shuts down or he<br/>\ntries to interact and has no idea he&#39;s being made the<br/>\nbutt of jokes or kid-cruelty.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelping him navigate the social waters is one of our<br/>\nbiggest challenges.  I guess we try to manipulate the<br/>\nwinds as much as possible so his sails stay full.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;end seasickness-inducing metaphor&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKap&#39;n Kathy - arrrgh<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s Good 2 B Dog Nutz!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.good2bdognutz.com\">http://www.good2bdognutz.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
