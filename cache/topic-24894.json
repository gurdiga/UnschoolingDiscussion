If he insisted on the adult<br/>\nversion, I think I would get it for him and watch it with him, assuring him<br/>\nthat he can stop watching whenever he wants if he decides he doesn&#39;t like<br/>\nthe movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if he gets nightmares from a scary movie, he will learn so much more<br/>\nabout himself by finding his own limits.  Example:  10yo decides she wants<br/>\nto save her allowance to get a bird.  I said fine and she asked to go to the<br/>\npet store to check out prices.  When she saw how much the bird costs, she<br/>\nchanged her mind.  Much different scenario than if I said I didn&#39;t think it<br/>\nwas a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24839,"nextTopicId":24784}}
