My dd 5 1/2 has always had a Boston slant. We joke b/c my ILs are from the are but only see her once a year or twice. NICKI~.......<br/>\n<br/>\nI just used it, the Boston accent thing, because it best describes the letters he didn&#39;t pronounce and others that he pronounced in his own way. He might have said &quot;bued&quot; instead of &quot;bird&quot; or &quot;muver&quot; instead of &quot;mother&quot;, that kind of thing. This made it impossible for him to use phonics to learn how to read words. He speaks clearly now, he&#39;s 12, and has almost lost the&quot;accent&quot; completely. He can read well but he still has some trouble working out a new word phonetically. He uses a variety of other clues including letter blends and sounds to decode language on his own. I always give him the word immediately if he asks for it, I never push him to work it out, assuming that he&#39;s tried it and that by the time he&#39;s asking me he&#39;s anxious to get the information. The same with spelling, if they ask for a word spelled correctly, I give it to them, I don&#39;t insist on watching them grope for it or making them work for it. I find that this approach, far from slowing they&#39;re development, encourages them to read and write more. If I put them through their paces with, &quot;sound it out&quot;, or &quot;look it up&quot;, the next thing I know their watching TV or doing something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1678","postDate":"1008034643","msgId":29822,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAxMTIxMDE3MzYxMC4wMGEwMjQ4MEBtYWlsLmlzbGFuZG5ldC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDE4MC43ZGNhNGYuMjk0NjcxYzdAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":29821,"nextInTopic":29828,"prevInTime":29821,"nextInTime":29823,"topicId":29807,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
