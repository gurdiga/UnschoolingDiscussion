I have adopted 3 children whose parental<br/>\nbackgrounds would make your hair stand on end.  While we were fostering but<br/>\nplanning to adopt Danny we knew he had Hepatitis C but we found out that the<br/>\ndr. was concerned he might also have HIV.  Scared me to death.  We cried and<br/>\ncried.  I will never forget the social worker asking if we were still<br/>\ninterested in adopting him.  It blew my mind.  We were committed to Danny no<br/>\nmatter what, didn&#39;t matter if some judge had signed a paper or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m trying to say is that a lot of people see families through adoption<br/>\nas almost some kind of insurance.  They screen birth parents much more<br/>\nthoroughly than they screen spouses or anyone else they might have children<br/>\nwith.  You can give birth to a perfectly normal child, have done all the<br/>\nright things, attachment parented, LLL, everything and the kid can still<br/>\nsuffer a head injury and you have that 18yo with the problems.  Or you can<br/>\nadopt Marsie whose parents were both retarded, 2 sisters are retarded, 1<br/>\nbrother and mom are psychotic and she can grow into one of the smartest,<br/>\nmost self-assured little 5yo on the planet.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48344,"nextTopicId":48602}}
