This allows them to focus on themselves and how thay are <br/>\nfeeling. When they say &quot;no&quot;, listen to the strength of their voice <br/>\nand use this information to help them tell the other kid what they <br/>\nfeel/what they want. If the response is loud and forceful, they are <br/>\nprobably fine going over there and telling the other child on their <br/>\nown. If they sound timid, you can offer to go along or do it for <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample from our household. <br/>\nOne takes something from the other, let&#39;s say Jacob does the taking.<br/>\nI will say &quot;Emma, did you like that?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;No&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Tell Jacob &quot;I&#39;m not ready, I&#39;m taking my turn&quot;&quot;<br/>\n(Which she generally does with glee. Sometimes she will ask me to <br/>\ntell him, which I do)<br/>\n<br/>\nI will generally add &quot;Jacob when she is done, she will let you know&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Emma, please let Jacob know when you are done&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHitting examples, assuming Emma is the one hitting.<br/>\nAfter the &quot;No&quot;<br/>\nTell her...<br/>\n&quot;That hurts, Emma. I&#39;m not for hitting.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Gentle please. That&#39;s too rough.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t like that. Stop!&quot;<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter about 2 weeks of &quot;feeding them words&quot; and encouraging them to <br/>\nbe bold and tell the other child what they want, they are beginning <br/>\nto do it by themselves more and more (and I am getting the luxury of <br/>\nbeing kept out of their fights)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it has given them more power to hear the words come out of <br/>\ntheir own mouths. It is also helping them play more easily with <br/>\nother kids in group situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is working for us.<br/>\nMaybe it isn&#39;t ideal for other families, but I am impressed at how <br/>\nmuch Emma can work out fights on her own (and stand up for herself). <br/>\nShe turned 2 in June.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat will conclude my Bailey thoughts too...<br/>\n<br/>\nKiersten</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107697,"nextTopicId":107688}}
