I&#39;m wondering if there exists a playgroup for younger children--mine is 13 months, and right now there are no kids around for him to play with.  I&#39;m really inspired by the unschooling philosophy and I hope my son will be too! Are there any playgroups for this age group already formed, or is anyone interested in starting one with us?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease write me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:djunapearl@...\">djunapearl@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYour favorite stores, helpful shopping tools and great gift ideas.
