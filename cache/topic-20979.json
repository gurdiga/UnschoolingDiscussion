My silverware <br/>\nis not completely clean, there&#39;s a film left on, probably from starchy <br/>\nveggies and pastas.  A similar film is on the dishes.  I have plastic <br/>\n(haven&#39;t found large glass jars yet) jugs for our raw goat&#39;s milk.  I have a <br/>\nwhite film left on these that looks like detergent film, milk film, or some <br/>\ncombination.  <br/>\n <br/>\n I do not want to give up on this yet.  I am committed to removing the harsh <br/>\nchemicals from our home.  But the dirty dishes are a bit embarrassing, I do <br/>\nnot wish to hand-wash as I am overwhelmed with ill-health and the needs of <br/>\nthree severely allergic children.

The Life Tree is working fairly well I&#39;d say. I do have <br/>\nto re wash a few things each load but I can deal w/ that so far. I wish I <br/>\ncould find one that works as well as Cascade or electrosol or whatever,but it <br/>\nis scary to me to use those types. <br/>\n<br/>\n    My glasses are coming out fine btw so maybe it would work for you too? <br/>\n<br/>\n    The other thing I use that I don&#39;t like is a Swiffer. I know it has <br/>\nchemicals and makes me shiver. Then I bought the wet ones and I was <br/>\noverwhelmed by the smell. Every window was open and I woke w/ a very sore <br/>\nthroat this Am after using them yesterday. We have alder wood floors and no <br/>\nstorage so it is tough to find a simple solution.
