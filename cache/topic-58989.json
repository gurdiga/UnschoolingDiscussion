Winter jammies and summer jammies and <br/>\nI of course did also. When I came down to FL for school, I still did <br/>\nalthough I think I modernized myself a bit and maybe changed to big <br/>\nt-shirts. Once I got out of school. the pj&#39;s went out the window. I&#39;ve slept <br/>\nnaked ever since. Tara does now too. She has pj&#39;s but those are for out of <br/>\nthe shower and before bed!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids know Joe and I sleep in the buff but have always worn shirts to <br/>\nbed. The baby wears onesies. Sierra had like one or two nightgowns that she <br/>\nwould wear whenever they came up in the drawer. Well the baby got a <br/>\nnightgown for Christmas and just fell in love with it. Wanted to wear it <br/>\nevery night and had a fit when I needed to wash it. Sierra would wear the <br/>\nones she had along with Alyssa so they could be twins! Needless to say that <br/>\nI had to go and buy both of them more nightgowns and also Joseph a pair of <br/>\npj&#39;s as he was feeling like maybe he should have some too!! He wore his once <br/>\nand switched back to his t-shirts. The girls did their nightgown thing for <br/>\nabout 2 weeks. One night, a rather hot night, Alyssa had to more nightgowns <br/>\nthat were clean and refused to wear anything but her diaper. Fine with me. <br/>\nSierra liked that idea and took off her shirt for bed that night too. They <br/>\nboth did that for about 5 days and now they are back to shirts, onesies and <br/>\nnightgowns again. Like a regualr circus around here!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58980,"nextTopicId":59001}}
