Seems like since I joined the list<br/>\nmy kids have been taking turns with one cold after another. And lately<br/>\nit has been my turn to sit in the bed with a box of tissues as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow I just need to share. Maybe get something off my chest. I am sure<br/>\npeople have doubts when they are homeschooling if they are doing the<br/>\nright thing. And sometimes I think the doubts are easier to get into<br/>\nwhen we unschool. I recently saw something on tv that had a<br/>\nhomeschooling family in it and the kids were all sitting nicely at the<br/>\ntable doing work out of book. I thought isnt that sweet. Then looked<br/>\naround at my family and thought gees maybe I should be pushing more for<br/>\nthem to do &quot;real&quot; work. Like books and paper and such. Of course a few<br/>\nmintues later I was thinking what the heck just got into me. I want my<br/>\nkids to be individuals and learn at thier own pace and learn what they<br/>\nwant and discover along the way who they are. But sometimes I wonder<br/>\nabout the choices I make as a parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it is harder since it seems I find so little in common with<br/>\nfamlies here locally. I don&#39;t know many families that do family bed or<br/>\nuse cloth diapers or breastfeed past a few months. My choices I make<br/>\ninformed and I makes choices that will best suit my family and our<br/>\nsituation but when the rest of the world goes along it is hard to keep<br/>\nthe beat of your own drum.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t know what my point is. *L*  Gee maybe that is my problem.<br/>\n(Or I need some sleep.)
