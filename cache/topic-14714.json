He&#39;s also a builder.  He&#39;s done food<br/>\ncoloring, baking soda & vinegar and numerous cardbourd box constructions<br/>\n(fortunately we have a basement to put them {pile them}).  I have a<br/>\nmessy house.  Our &quot;rule&quot; is pick some things up before you take out<br/>\nothers.  We also will do a ten minute pick up.  Of late we&#39;ve decided<br/>\nthat the parent who is home with our son is in &quot;charge&quot; of making sure<br/>\n&quot;everything&quot; is picked up before the other one comes home.   The actual<br/>\nbottem line is - enough has to be picked up so you don&#39;t trip over it.<br/>\nAll of us our pack rats all well, which came in handy this Yule while<br/>\nmaking presents.   Instead of buying many things we try and make it -<br/>\nand usually have what we need at home.  With friends with cat allergies<br/>\nand my own home based business with monthly meetings we are force to<br/>\nclean (vacumn) at least a couple times a month.  LET&#39;S HEAR IT FOR MESSY<br/>\nCREATIVE HOUSES!<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14709,"nextTopicId":14717}}
