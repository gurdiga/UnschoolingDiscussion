Thus, repeated exposure to any stimulus<br/>\n&gt; in a child&#39;s environment may forcibly impact mental<br/>\n&gt; and emotional growth, either by setting up particular<br/>\n&gt; circuitry (&quot;habits of mind&quot;) or by depriving the brain<br/>\n&gt; of other experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have nothing against neuroscientists.
