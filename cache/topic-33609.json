So, my dad, my<br/>\nbrother, Cacie, and I (my sister didn&#39;t want to be part of any of it) got<br/>\ntogether and made plans, based on what she wanted and what we remebered<br/>\nher saying over the years. My brother wants to be cremated and have his<br/>\nashes tossed into the ocean in a tackle box by the whole family,<br/>\nsomewhere warm so we get a good vacation out of it. I&#39;m not sure of the<br/>\nlegalities, but it&#39;s a nice though. Cacie wants the very flashy, plush,<br/>\npurple casket. My dad will be creamted and his urn put in the same<br/>\ncolumbarium niche as my mother. They also have three boxes of dog<br/>\ncremains on the bookshelf in the den, in between butterfly books and<br/>\nbooks on the Sea of Cortez, but they&#39;re not allowed in the columbarium...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe funniest moment was when we all went to chose a casket for my mom<br/>\n(you can chose the cardboard box option with a cremation, but because we<br/>\nwere having a viewing we chose a simple casket). We all walked into a<br/>\nfairly large room with different open caskets along the walls and in the<br/>\ncenter. It was more emotionally wrenching than we had expected - my<br/>\nbrother had to leave the room at first - but as we walked through Cacie<br/>\nquipped &quot;This looks like a hotel for vampires&quot; and we laughed, and it was<br/>\nbetter...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve used the same funeral home for my mom, my grandpa (&#39;92) and my<br/>\nsister (&#39;78). My dad knows them professionally, as well, which maybe<br/>\nmakes it a little easier, but they seem to keep a nice balance between<br/>\nsympathetic and businesslike, and they were open to all of our unusual<br/>\nrequests (mostly the somewhat unorthodox obit my dad wrote and bringing<br/>\nmy mom&#39;s little dog to the viewing, in hopes that she would finally stop<br/>\nwaiting for her by the back door).

I always enjoyed <br/>\nthose boxes when I was small so I thought it might be a nice way to <br/>\ngo.  My family can think of me when they eat ice cream.  I have also <br/>\ntold him that I will haunt him if he lets some goofy beautician play <br/>\nwith my face and hair or dress me in churchy clothes.  I hate that <br/>\nstuff now, so why would I want to be dressed up then?  I think a <br/>\nflannel nightgown would be nice. That is probably how my kids will <br/>\nremember me best (besides it is cold down there).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlaura</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"How I want to go","postDate":"1016942795","msgId":33609,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTcwMWMxZDJlOSQ1MjdiMjZhMCQ1ZDgzZWU0MEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMTY4OTgwMzIuODk1NTAuMzc1MzcubTJAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":33611,"prevInTime":33608,"nextInTime":33610,"topicId":33609,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have had the ideal funeral planned for some time now.
