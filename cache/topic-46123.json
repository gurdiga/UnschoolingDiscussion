My email bin is way too full!<br/>\nAfter less than a week I need to say...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m too old to worry about the WEANING thing. Nursed all three of <br/>\nmine but not as long as I would have liked.  (My baby just turned 7 <br/>\nyesterday... sniff).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is easily FRUSTRATED and don&#39;t you dare offer to help because it <br/>\nmakes it worse!!  (That is a whole separate post.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m 39<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t remember many cute words from my little ones right now but I <br/>\nremember the same &quot;fruck&quot; issue.   My 10 year old just gave me the <br/>\ngiggles with the name Penelope (rhymes with Cantaloupe right?)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a habit of a few nicknames  It started with the oldest<br/>\nbeing &quot;Care Bear&quot; He is 14 and I will occasionally still call him <br/>\nthat. (Guess I had better ask if he minds.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 3 kids so I don&#39;t get many comments.  They are boy, boy, girl <br/>\nso we did get &quot;Trying for a girl this time&quot; or &quot;Finally got that <br/>\ngirl&quot;.  I reply truthfully &quot;nope, we wanted 3 from the beginning and <br/>\nthat is what we are glad to have period.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally what really jerked me out of lurking...<br/>\n<br/>\nNoah...<br/>\nThis is the story that started my quest for a different God (at the <br/>\ntender age of 6).  I wanted no part of a God that would drown all of <br/>\nthose animals. (Notice I did not have too much sympathy for the <br/>\npeople at the time). <br/>\nI too have a very questioning nature and a God who lets (or causes) <br/>\nbad things to happen because &quot;his ways are know only to him&quot; etc etc <br/>\nranks right up there with the parental &quot;because I said so&quot; to put it <br/>\nmildy.  OR on a lighter side as Cosby quoted &quot;I brought you into this <br/>\nworld and I can take you out.&quot;<br/>\nI have watched many make the same species, numbers, size comments <br/>\nthat always bothered me and I will add.  The whole world covered with <br/>\nwater?  Was it salt or fresh??  Not all creatures would be happy<br/>\nif it was one or the other. <br/>\nI don&#39;t expect or need any explanation. I caution all to be careful <br/>\nhow they share this story (and similar hell-fire and brimstone <br/>\nstories) with children. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I will sign off and say that I have many questions and <br/>\nconcerns for other posts in the near future.  I look forward to the <br/>\nwords of wisdom, jokes and even the debates to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely<br/>\nBeth (mother to 14 yos  10yos  and 7yod) <br/>\nunschooler wannabe but stuck with eclectic for now (also another post)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46061,"nextTopicId":45087}}
