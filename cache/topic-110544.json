Actually, I can only<br/>\nspeak for myself...I tend to think things through myself, and not talk<br/>\nabout it; preferably alone before dc are out of bed in the a.m.<br/>\n I do think it is worth the effort to try to learn some &#39;thinking out<br/>\nloud&quot; for the sake of the dc being able to listen in.
