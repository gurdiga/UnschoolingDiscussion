She uses the word homeschooling, <br/>\n    but I think unschooling works even better. <br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot;How to be a Homeschooler in Six Easy Steps&quot; by Casey Gold<br/>\n<br/>\n    Step 1: Get one of your parents to quit his or her job to stay home.<br/>\n    Step 2: Ask your Mom or Dad if he or she can try teaching you at home <br/>\n    for a day.<br/>\n    Step 3: If your Mom or Dad liked teaching you at home ask if he or <br/>\n    she can do it again, but this time only do the subjects you like.<br/>\n    Step 4: Ask to do it again. But this time ask to do it with no <br/>\n    subjects at all.<br/>\n    Step 5: Now find some homeschooler friends and have fun playing with <br/>\n    them.<br/>\n    Step 6: Great! Now you&#39;re a homeschooler. Go have fun playing with <br/>\n    your friends. Do what ever you want to.<br/>\n<br/>\n    The End<br/>\n<br/>\n    Please note that this 9 year old who ends her book &quot;Do what ever you <br/>\n    want to&quot; chose to spend her time writing a book. She used the <br/>\n    dictionary to look up spellings (a new idea for her) and even had <br/>\n    illustrations for each step. In an unschooling family, &quot;Do what ever <br/>\n    you want to&quot; does not mean run wild and never learn anything. It is a <br/>\n    very positive experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Life is good.<br/>\n    ~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the <br/>\n    green earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly <br/>\n    alive.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                          ~ Thich Nhat Hanh<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Yahoo!
