They&#39;ll either be impressed or sorry <br/>\nthey asked!  This is what I mean...<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; 1.  &quot;What curriculum do you use?&quot;<br/>\nOn a ___________(daily, weekly, monthly) basis, I evaluate the children&#39;s <br/>\nskills and design for them an IEP (Individual educational plan...but use the <br/>\nacronym, it sounds more impressive).  According to the outcome of the IEP <br/>\nconference, we glean resources from many different academic areas, using <br/>\ncontent that is pertinent to their particular needs and interests.  (get the <br/>\nidea?)<br/>\n <br/>\n 2.  &quot;What do you do all day?&quot;<br/>\nWe spend our day working on a rotation basis with multiple educational tools <br/>\ndesigned for teaching ADL&#39;s (activities of daily living).  Children and <br/>\nadults work daily on expanding their creative potential using all resources <br/>\navailable to them.  We also hold daily workshops dealing with the following <br/>\nsubjects: crisis management; diversity education; handling emotions and <br/>\nsibling rivalry.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3.  &quot;Do you work from home while the kids school?&quot;<br/>\nMy husband (partner, etc.) are co-researchers on a longitudinal study that <br/>\ninvolves the observation of multi-age subjects while at work and play.  On a <br/>\ndaily basis, we evaluate the relevancy of the educational approach to the <br/>\ndesired outcome for the subject.  This study is time-consuming; requiring 24 <br/>\nhour attentiveness and leaves me too busy at this time to pursue other <br/>\ncommitments.<br/>\n <br/>\n 4.  &quot;I thought I saw you at the park yesterday.  Are you on a break?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, we were actually testing a recently published study that states that <br/>\nchildren learn better when offered the opportunity for regular outdoor <br/>\nexercise and exposure to natural elements. After analyzing the personal data <br/>\nwe compiled, we found ourselves quite in agreement with the study!<br/>\n <br/>\n 5.  And, my personal favorite, &quot;When are you going to put the kids back<br/>\n in school again?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nMy children are already in school, if you consider school to be a place where <br/>\npeople pursue learning.

Are you on a break?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n 5.  And, my personal favorite, &quot;When are you going to put the kids back<br/>\n in school again?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n See what I mean!!  Thanks in advance for an &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk -- are you trying to blow these people off, let them know how rude you <br/>\nthink they are, actually answer the questions, educate them to possibilities <br/>\nthey might not know about, a blend of the above, none of the above.  I find <br/>\nthese questions can take a lot of energy but sometimes, rarely, the <br/>\nconversation is actually worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo:  <br/>\n<br/>\n1.  We do not follow a strict curriculum.  It is not required in our state.  <br/>\nOne can, of course, puchase a pre-packaged curr.  I have check on what the <br/>\nstate standards are for the public schools and feel that these are so <br/>\npathetic that I have no fear that we are doing at least that much (in our <br/>\nsleep).  This last is usually met with vigorous nods from anyone with a child <br/>\nin ps.  My experience only of course.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf this does not fully satisfy the questioner, there is usually an actual <br/>\nconversation about how different families do things and how each child has <br/>\ndifferent needs and rates and methods of learning.  Etc etc etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\n2.  I have never been asked this -- what a stupid question.  Anyone who is <br/>\nhome with two kids knows what you do all day -- you never sit -- except for <br/>\nnow typing on the computer.  Are they asking about your schedule or just not <br/>\ncomfortable being with their kids for that much of the day?  I am confused by <br/>\nthe question and would probably laugh and say, well, we&#39;re very busy, what do <br/>\nyou mean??<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  I do work part-time, handling the billing/banking/payroll for my <br/>\nhusband&#39;s biz -- all that admin stuff that he can&#39;t stand -- at least we&#39;re <br/>\nnot paying someone else to do it.  Yes, the kids now know how to use the <br/>\nlittle pneumatic tube at the bank!<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  Really, we missed you -- were you there?  Another odd question.  I would <br/>\nsay we must have been playing tennis, or basketball, or kite flying, or <br/>\nwhatever it was we were doing.  The kids had a ball!<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  I say that we are keeping our options open but I really haven&#39;t heard <br/>\nanything that has made me want to rush back.  Again, this usually brings nods <br/>\nand a horror story or two about ps.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people just want to vent about their ps, sometimes they even have a <br/>\nnice program to brag about, sometimes they are genuinely curious.

Take away the sick feeling in my stomach - what<br/>\ndo I say? what will they think if I give a &#39;bad&#39; answer? - and I find I am<br/>\nable to judge very quickly whether the person is actually genuinely<br/>\ninterested, but lacking understanding of what homeschooling is about, or if<br/>\nthey are just saying something to fill an empty space, or if they are<br/>\nantagonistic to homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if they are in the first category (rare) I explain nicely.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they are in either of the other categories, I would say something like:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1.  &quot;What curriculum do you use?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2.  &quot;What do you do all day?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Enjoy life with my children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3.  &quot;Do you work from home while the kids school?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4.  &quot;I thought I saw you at the park yesterday.  Are you on a break?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 5.  And, my personal favorite, &quot;When are you going to put the kids back<br/>\n&gt; in school again?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not. (maybe adding - &#39;When are you going to take yours out?&#39;)<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep it to the minimum. These questions are almost always in the same class<br/>\nas &#39;how are you?&#39; and if you&#39;ve ever responded to that question with details<br/>\nof your haemorrhoids, or your herpes virus, you&#39;ll understand what I&#39;m<br/>\nsaying. They really don&#39;t want to know. And if you&#39;ve misread them, they&#39;ll<br/>\nask more questions, so you&#39;ll know that they are really in the interested<br/>\nbut misguided category.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW my all time most hated question is &#39;Are you sure you are doing the best<br/>\nthing for your children?&#39;. The arrogance. I&#39;ve been asked this a number of<br/>\ntimes and after the first time I have responded brightly &#39;Oh no, I know it&#39;s<br/>\nreally bad for them, in fact I make it as unpleasant as possible for them, I<br/>\nmean it really hurt giving birth so I figure I owe them a lot of agony for<br/>\nthat, I like them to really suffer, oh no it isn&#39;t best for them, but it<br/>\nsure makes me feel better to see them suffer....etc. etc.....&#39; This draws an<br/>\ninstant apology and is usually followed by some well considered questions,<br/>\nand a far greater interest in homeschooling than was there before!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tim and Kerry Jones","from":"Tim and Kerry Jones &lt;pakt@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"aXpyG6DKyesAHCJL9bv0QgVM_tiEgHEHUbMiyWQKGsQ00C7Iu0XzbrJNIdxywRNptbMDtg53SmnA6uKFXwB6mstSr537z185kQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Snappy responses","postDate":"948204042","msgId":5664,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNzQuNTY2NC45NTkyNjk3NDVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5665,"prevInTime":5663,"nextInTime":5665,"topicId":5664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ok.
