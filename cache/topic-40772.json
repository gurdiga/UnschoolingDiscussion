But that wasn&#39;t aimed at you. It <br/>\nwasn&#39;t destructive, and it wasn&#39;t insulting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list exists for unschoolers to help other unschoolers.  Perhaps as you <br/>\nare not currently unschooling you could find another outlet for your obvious <br/>\nneed to scare and disturb and insult people.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;But mention something about how unschooling is<br/>\nsubject to stupid laws and ignorant politicians and judges who want to make<br/>\nit illegal, and WHAP, the fertilizer hits the vent, collectivist<br/>\nsensitivities are ruffled, the defenders of the status quo come out snarling<br/>\nand demanding silence, go away, yadayada.  Where is the moderator when we<br/>\nneed one?!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s partly what you say, but it&#39;s mostly the way you say it, with total <br/>\ndisregard for the feelings of anyone, with EXTREME rudeness and drama, that <br/>\nis irritating people, Ned.  You make fun of people for begging you to be <br/>\nnicer.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;. This list is probably the vanguard of<br/>\nhomeschooling, the storm troops, the elite corps of homeschooling, the first<br/>\nteam (sorry about all the guy analogies)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, there are lots of unschooling outlets and forums.<br/>\nUnschooling is the vanguard of homeschooling, I don&#39;t doubt.  But this list <br/>\nisn&#39;t the only one by far.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Unschoolers are the people who have<br/>\ntried curriculum-in-a-box and sent it back as useless and controlling, too<br/>\nmuch like what we&#39;re trying to forget. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of us never did that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of lists like this (when  they are calm and more useful) and because <br/>\nof bulletin boards online for the past twelve years, and newsgroups before <br/>\nthat, very many unschoolers come straight to unschooling, bypassing the <br/>\nformal curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;We&#39;re also NOT the people who care a<br/>\nlot about hurting anyone&#39;s feelings (check Tia&#39;s tag line) or worrying<br/>\nwhether we&#39;re politically correct.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou misunderstand Tia&#39;s tagline.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;HOMESCHOOLING  IS  POLITICALLY  INCORRECT.<br/>\nAre you not aware of that?  Is that news to anyone?<br/>\nand...<br/>\nUNSCHOOLING  IS  OFF  THE  CHARTS  INCORRECT,&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are yelling at the choir.<br/>\nThe tone is rude.<br/>\nYou&#39;re telling us what we already know.<br/>\nWhy?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;In fact, this list just might be where homeschooling should be planning its<br/>\nnational survival, or maybe its great surge to achieve total acceptance.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t need total acceptance or national survival (AGAIN, for the many-eth <br/>\ntime, this is an international list).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe need individual daily success and peace in homes.  Families need to learn <br/>\nto relax into natural learning, not be scared that the county will show up to <br/>\ntake their kids away.  Unschooling will work for more people the more people <br/>\nit works for.  By encouraging and aiding those who choose it, the surface of <br/>\nthe movement is larger, more people will have known a successful unschooling <br/>\nfamily personally, there will be more tales to find easily, continually <br/>\nmounting evidence and confidence, and gradually (because it can&#39;t be grabbed) <br/>\nmore acceptance.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;If people get nervous when we talk,<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry, but this is not the place where we need to explain ourselves or<br/>\nmince our words. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople get nervous when YOU talk.<br/>\nWe DO  need to explain ourselves here. You don&#39;t like to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t a political rally.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I want not to cajole<br/>\npeople, to inspire, to encourage if possible...not to give ideas for daily<br/>\nplans, but life-changing insights. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers do both all the time.<br/>\nYOU might not want to inspire and to encourage and help people with their <br/>\nunschooling in this moment, but I really do and your ranting is not helping <br/>\nwhat some of us have been doing for many years, and what some who come here <br/>\nTHIS WEEK will be doing for many years after some of us have grown children <br/>\nand are no longer in the front lines of inspiring and encouraging.  That cast <br/>\nchanges.  But Mary/Zenmomma and Pam/Psoroosh are valuable in ways you are <br/>\nnot, Ned, and if you have any vestige of respect for those who ARE doing <br/>\nvaluable work, back off of them and let them do their work without being <br/>\nshamed by you in public.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I mostly respond to other people&#39;s posts in the best, most helpful way I<br/>\ncan, and I&#39;ll admit that most of what I believe will offend some group or<br/>\nother, but I won&#39;t apologize, and I need a good reason to go away,<br/>\nespecially when the listmembers who have expressed interest in what I say<br/>\nalso seem to be the best-informed and most clear-headed.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMake a new list and invite people here to it.  See how many you get.  You <br/>\nmight get lots!  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve just stated that those who oppose your tone or who express lack of <br/>\ninterest in what you are expressing are not the best informed and not the <br/>\nmost clear headed people here.  That is a broad and deep insult.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Hurray for unschooling. It is leading the way, but it takes courage.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou doubt my courage Ned?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Courage. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou think that those who don&#39;t want to hear you rant about libertarian <br/>\nsky-falling are lacking in courage?  That they&#39;re just not very smart?<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you can learn some tact and compassion.
