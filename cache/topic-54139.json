We say we homeschool and most people drop the<br/>\nsubject.  Robin does however like to go into details about how great it<br/>\nis and they should do it too.  People smile at him and are polite (well<br/>\nhe looks like the Little Prince - I&#39;m sure that doesn&#39;t hurt).<br/>\n<br/>\nA few times people have told us about their experiences with<br/>\nhomeschooling or homeschoolers (so far it&#39;s always been positive).<br/>\n<br/>\nLast fall while the kids and I were goofing off at a pumpkin patch, a<br/>\nprivate school pulled up and one of the moms asked me if we were with<br/>\ntheir school.  I said no we homeschool.  She said their school was so<br/>\nprogressive that it was the same thing.  I just looked at her and said,<br/>\nno it&#39;s not.  That was the end of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\nwho loves to be a bitch sometimes</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54119,"nextTopicId":54142}}
