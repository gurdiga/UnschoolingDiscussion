I&#39;m also giving a talk this week (along with someone else) to people <br/>\njust considering homeschooling and we always struggle with how much to make <br/>\nit unschooling-based versus how much to just be more objective and tell them <br/>\nabout all the different ways homeschoolers homeschool. In my case, they are <br/>\ndefinitely NOT expecting an unschooling talk. They&#39;ve probably never heard of <br/>\nsuch ideas. So, clearly, we&#39;ll talk about it -- but .....<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of your answers were kind of amusing --- especially this one: <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;13. How do you choose which homeschool resources, books, and curricula to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>use, and where do you get them?<br/>\n<br/>\nA. It doesn&#39;t matter. &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd THIS is so important!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;HINT: It will never be algebra or french or social studies or etc,<br/>\netc. It will be airplanes, or dinosaurs or money or the sky or etc, etc.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTHIS is something I think we forget to tell people -- I remember that it took <br/>\nme forever to catch on that with unschooling, my kids were probably NEVER <br/>\ngoing to say: &quot;Okay - now I&#39;m interested in social studies,&quot; &lt;G&gt;. In fact, <br/>\nthey were probably never going to say, &quot;I&#39;d like to study American history,&quot; <br/>\neven. They&#39;d just DO it -- pick it up from everything going on around them - <br/>\nfrom movies and reading and discussions and happenstance and music and so on. <br/>\nWhat they&#39;d be passionately interested in would be very specific and <br/>\nidiosyncratic such as Gilbert and Sullivan musicals or female folk singers of <br/>\nthe 1960&#39;s or how surfboards were made in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s or how guns <br/>\nworked during the civil war period. Even those unschooled kids I know who <br/>\ndevelop an interest in, say, &quot;American History,&quot; have a very very specific <br/>\nkind of history they are interested in - military history, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of people THINK we&#39;re telling them that, if they let their kids <br/>\nhave real freedom to choose, their kids will regain their love of learning <br/>\n(which is true), and that they&#39;ll choose to learn the same kinds of things in <br/>\nthe same kinds of ways that schools try to teach (which is highly unlikely).<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38303,"nextTopicId":38316}}
