Let me tell<br/>\nyou what I remember about chemistry class in high school.  Fe is iron.  H2O<br/>\nis water.  I remember that I hated chemistry precisely because I had to<br/>\nmemorize the periodic table (I assume that�s what she meant by chemistry<br/>\nelements?) and I saw no reason that this was valuable.  The other thing I<br/>\nremember is that half of the experiments that I did did not yield the<br/>\nresults I was �supposed� to get, so I would have to look at someone else�s<br/>\nto make my lab report.  But science isn�t about doing prescribed experiments<br/>\nwhere you are supposed to get a particular answer.  It�s about your own<br/>\nobservations; correct me if I�m wrong.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it is nice to see something about unschooling in an ezine geared toward<br/>\nschool at homers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela S.<br/>\n<br/>\nHYPERLINK &quot;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a>&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLife Is Good! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nNo virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>\nVersion: 7.1.409 / Virus Database: 268.14.1/527 - Release Date: 11/9/2006<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>\nVersion: 7.1.409 / Virus Database: 268.14.1/527 - Release Date: 11/9/2006<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Positive Unschool read","postDate":"1163187132","msgId":27321,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVFMEI5QTQ4LUJFRTItNENBNC1CQzFGLUU1NzNDNTg5MzlCNUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTctRjE5NkYyRDM5NDMyNkY0QUFBMDlFNDdDQUY3MEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTctRjE5NkYyRDM5NDMyNkY0QUFBMDlFNDdDQUY3MEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":27320,"nextInTopic":27322,"prevInTime":27320,"nextInTime":27322,"topicId":27318,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Another brick out of the wall hopefully. -=- Amen.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2021439472\">-=- Another brick out of the wall hopefully.<br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAmen.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":282257979,"authorName":"Wildflower Car","from":"&quot;Wildflower Car&quot; &lt;unschoolfool@...&gt;","profile":"red_olive5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Positive Unschool read","postDate":"1163185434","msgId":27320,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTctRjE5NkYyRDM5NDMyNkY0QUFBMDlFNDdDQUY3MEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":27319,"nextInTopic":27321,"prevInTime":27319,"nextInTime":27321,"topicId":27318,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes, I agree.

One reader shared about her Charlotte Mason<br/>\n  based co-op and I thoroughly enjoyed reading about it!  I thought<br/>\n  you  would be as inspired as I was, so here it is for YOUR enjoyment,<br/>\n  as well.  Grab a cup of tea and enjoy this issue! -- Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n<br/>\n  A Charlotte Mason Co-op<br/>\n     by Janey Phillips, (a reader in Texas)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;I am part of a co-op this year that was formed to implement the<br/>\n  Charlotte Mason style of learning.  The moms all wanted to have the<br/>\n  co-op provide opportunities for some of the things that seemed to get<br/>\n  &#39;skipped&#39; at home.  We have eighteen kids who participate and the<br/>\n  age range is from 9 to 16, with the 11 to 13 age being the predominate<br/>\n  group.  Moms share the teaching responsibilities.  We meet one day<br/>\n  a week, for 3 hours.  Almost all of the participants are also involved<br/>\n  in a homeschool string orchestra that is taught by one of our co-op<br/>\n  moms; they meet the same day,  from 10:00 to about 11:15.  After<br/>\n  orchestra, some of the co-op moms gather at the meeting location<br/>\n  and eat picnic lunches with our families.  Lately we&#39;ve had such<br/>\n  pleasant weather, we&#39;ve eaten outside the building under shade trees.<br/>\n  This gives moms a chance to visit before classes begin, and the kids<br/>\n  eat, then run off to play together.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our class time begins at 12.  We have an introductory Latin class,<br/>\n  using Latina Christiana; four of the eighteen students had already<br/>\n  passed this point in Latin, so during the Latin class they work on<br/>\n  individual studies brought from home in another room, or a couple<br/>\n  of them might play a game of chess.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then we have a class that rotates weekly between art skills, picture<br/>\n  study (art appreciation), and nature study.  The mom who teaches<br/>\n  the art classes is an art major & a Charlotte Mason adherent, so<br/>\n  she is great for the job.  A different mom leads nature study, and<br/>\n  she varies the style of class each time.  Sometimes she brings in<br/>\n  nature for them to learn from; one week it was poison ivy plants and<br/>\n  look-alikes, which was important before nature walks.  One week<br/>\n  we did a nature walk for just 10 or 15 minutes outside the building,<br/>\n  with everyone picking something to write about in nature journals.<br/>\n  The nature mom has also set up a monthly field trip with a local<br/>\n  state Forest Service employee.  The first one was a pond study, and the<br/>\n  kids got to do water sampling, look for insects and other critters that<br/>\n  live in the water, and learn about the conditions necessary for various<br/>\n  species to live. Other nature field trips in the offing include a visit<br/>\n  to the national forest to see the red-cockaded woodpecker habitat, a<br/>\n  nature walk for the purpose of tree identification, and a night at the<br/>\n  nearby college&#39;s observatory to see the stars.  We asked for and<br/>\n  received a private viewing due to the size of our group, which will give<br/>\n  the kids more time at the telescopes than they would otherwise have had.<br/>\n<br/>\n  After art/nature time we have a short 15 minute break with snacks.<br/>\n  The kids are encouraged to go outside and run around.  Sword<br/>\n  play and soccer ball-kicking are popular during this time. We meet<br/>\n  on a church campus, so there is a small playground available also.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our next class of the day is Shakespeare, and this one is age-divided.<br/>\n  One mom takes the younger group on an enjoyable and fun read of a<br/>\n  slightly abridged version, still in play form.  They are having a blast<br/>\n  and have had sword fights, recitations, and scene enactments.  The<br/>\n  older group is reading the original work of the same play, Romeo and<br/>\n  Juliet, and has a Shakespeare project to complete for the term.<br/>\n  Options for the project were wide-ranging in style and the students<br/>\n  have already jumped into work on their projects.  One is rewriting the<br/>\n  play for a children&#39;s illustrated book; one is making a Romeo and<br/>\n  Juliet board game; one is writing a song for Romeo and Juliet, and a<br/>\n  couple of the boys are working on websites.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our final class is a science lab.  One of our moms is a biology lover,<br/>\n  and she is leading the kids through dissection of four animals this<br/>\n  semester. They have a class to discuss the creature and its internal<br/>\n  workings one week, then actually dissect the next.  They are doing<br/>\n  an earthworm, grasshopper, frog, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We also have one mom who serves as our events coordinator.  She<br/>\n  does the calling and setting up of special field trips, collects funds<br/>\n  for the tickets, etc. She also coordinates the weekly snack time,<br/>\n  which we rotate between moms.  Our group will attend a theater<br/>\n  performance of Romeo and Juliet this month, and she arranged this<br/>\n  for us, making sure we got tickets early enough to get good seating.<br/>\n  Again, the size of our group lets us get tickets at half-price and we<br/>\n  all voted to spring for the top price range for the event.  Later,<br/>\n  during the spring semester, we plan to visit an art museum in Houston<br/>\n  that will have an exhibit of French painters from the 1800s.  These art<br/>\n  works are on tour from the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art,<br/>\n  and include Degas, Picasso, Van Gogh, Renoir, Monet, Millet, and<br/>\n  others that the students will be familiar with. It is an opportunity we<br/>\n  don&#39;t want them to miss.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One of the best things about our co-op is the richness of the experi-<br/>\n  ences we are being able to provide the students.  I love walking into<br/>\n  the room where the kids are engaged in drawing or dissection and<br/>\n  hearing the hum from them.  It says they are really involved in the<br/>\n  present activity.  When the minds are engaged that way, learning is<br/>\n  happening.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Some things just work better in a group setting (drama for one), and<br/>\n  a small co-op is the best of the good things about a &#39;classroom&#39;<br/>\n  situation while still retaining the style and benefits of home educa-<br/>\n  tion.  The eight moms involved were not all a closely knit group of<br/>\n  friends to begin with, but were brought together for their mutual<br/>\n  interest in Charlotte Mason education and the ages of their children.<br/>\n  We are working together well, and though it&#39;s only about six weeks into<br/>\n  our first semester, the general consensus is that we all want to<br/>\n  continue.  At the end of each semester we are having a &#39;performance&#39;<br/>\n  night, with the kids doing scenes from Shakespeare, showing off their<br/>\n  Latin chants and recitation, and displaying nature journals, art work,<br/>\n  and Shakespeare projects from the older class.  We&#39;ll invite dads,<br/>\n  grandparents, friends, and have finger foods. The kids are really<br/>\n  looking forward to this as well.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n<br/>\n  Wow!

Even if you don&#39;t fully<br/>\n  understand or agree with this method, I think you will enjoy<br/>\n  reading what Elizabeth has to say!]<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;I can tell everyone from experience that un-schooling works.<br/>\n  I have adult children who graduated with honors from leading<br/>\n  Universities. The interesting thing is they found college level<br/>\n  work very simple!<br/>\n<br/>\n  When I started homeschooling with them, there were no web-<br/>\n  sites, and very little information available. I did not like public<br/>\n  school curriculum, so I decided to let them learn at their own<br/>\n  pace. We wore the library out. We went to every museum<br/>\n  within 500 miles and they developed a love of leaning. We built<br/>\n  rockets, dug wishing wells, built a playhouse, and pretty much<br/>\n  anything they decided they were interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\n  They learned their multiplication facts through working out plans<br/>\n  for things they wanted to build. They learned algebraic functions<br/>\n  by rocket and aircraft building. I found if they could find a need<br/>\n  for something, they learned with total enthusiasm.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I still have one ten year old at home and he is also an un-schooler.<br/>\n  He might be my brightest of all of the kids. He is completely self-<br/>\n  motivated and if something interests him, he will wear out the<br/>\n  books and computer until he has all the information.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He had NO interest in reading until age 8. Then he wanted to learn<br/>\n  to read words on the computer and in 6 months he was reading on<br/>\n  a 7th grade level. If I had tried to make him learn earlier, he might<br/>\n  have not developed his love of reading. We could have fought from<br/>\n  age 4 to learn words but I doubt he would have progressed to the<br/>\n  level he is if we had been trying all those years. It might have made<br/>\n  him have a dislike of reading which could never be overcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I believe children are natural learners. I don&#39;t care if mine stand on<br/>\n  their heads to watch a National Geographic video, just that they<br/>\n  absorb what they watch. I don&#39;t care if he sits at a desk or on his<br/>\n  bed to learn his chemistry elements, just so he learns them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess what I am trying to say is let your children be kids. Don&#39;t<br/>\n  try to make them Einsteins or child prodigies. Just let them play.<br/>\n  If you give them the opportunities to explore, they will learn and<br/>\n  exceed all your expectations.&quot; -- Elizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you have an idea, experience, or tip to share?

I don&#39;t have a lot of storage space, and we<br/>\n  are not required by our state to keep a portfolio of our child&#39;s work.<br/>\n  Is there anything that I should keep just for the sake of keeping a<br/>\n  record or is it better to just keep &#39;scores&#39; in subject areas?  I<br/>\n  only do oral testing at the moment, and even that is really relaxed.&quot;<br/>\n  -- Jennifer in NC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    =========================<br/>\n      Our Readers&#39; Responses<br/>\n    =========================<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Wonderful responses from our readers!! Thanks to all who wrote.]<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;I also live in NC, but I keep some of their best work every year.<br/>\n  I am blessed with a large 5 drawer file cabinet and have a drawer<br/>\n  for each child, with a file folder for each year, divided by grade.<br/>\n  As the children produce work that I think is worth keeping or earn an<br/>\n  award certificate, I just put it in their folder.  I keep things like<br/>\n  handwriting samples, history notebooks, stories, artwork, and things<br/>\n  I think they will be interested in seeing in the future. I do not<br/>\n  keep things like spelling tests, math workbooks etc.  My 3rd grader<br/>\n  already thinks her kindergarten handwriting book is a hoot and loves to<br/>\n  go look through her stuff... and my 10th grader has almost filled the<br/>\n  drawer!  Good thing we only have two more years!&quot; -- Cheryl in NC<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;You might want to consider keeping a sample of your child&#39;s work<br/>\n  from the beginning, middle, and end of the year, stubs and pictures<br/>\n  from field trips and co-op activities, and pictures of your child&#39;s<br/>\n  projects (kinda&#39; difficult to save science experiments!). Put these<br/>\n  in a scrapbook, if for no other reason than it will bring you and<br/>\n  your family years of pleasure... and may also answer the question,<br/>\n  &#39;What do you do all day?&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Making a scrapbook could be incorporated into your homeschool<br/>\n  planning -- get your child involved and teach art, writing (captions,<br/>\n  journalling), timelines.  One or two pages for each month with extra<br/>\n  pages for special trips or projects would make a wonderful keepsake.<br/>\n  It would be your child&#39;s &#39;yearbook&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Welcome to homeschooling!&quot; -- Tricia in NH<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;We are not required to keep any sort of a portfolio, either, but it<br/>\n  is wise for several reasons - so you and your children can look back<br/>\n  on what you&#39;ve done, in case anyone questions what you have done,<br/>\n  and in case you become incapacitated and someone else needs to<br/>\n  step in.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I do it in two steps:<br/>\n<br/>\n  1) I keep a notebook of what we do so that I will be able to check<br/>\n  easily what we have accomplished.<br/>\n<br/>\n  2) I keep a file with samples of work - art, occasional worksheets,<br/>\n  drawings, etc. I also try to take pictures on field trips.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Even if you are not doing testing, there are still writing projects<br/>\n  and such that can easily be included in a folder.&quot; -- Elouise in BC<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;There are great programs out there for keeping track of scores<br/>\n  and such on the computer.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have one to<br/>\n  share right now, but I bet you could do a search online and find a<br/>\n  number of great choices.  In terms of a hard copies, I think I might<br/>\n  hold on to the tests or graded papers and keep a grade book, too.<br/>\n  There are a number of free forms that you can use online - or you<br/>\n  can go to your teacher supply store and get a grade recording book.<br/>\n  Also - not sure this is a part of what you are looking for in terms<br/>\n  of &#39;keeping papers and things&#39;, but it is a great tip someone gave me<br/>\n  ...and I&#39;m so glad I use it.  Each year at the end of the school year<br/>\n  I pick maybe a &#39;dozen&#39; keepsake papers for each child - along with<br/>\n  all their test papers - and I put them in a folder to have for record<br/>\n  keeping or just for our family to have and look back upon.  These<br/>\n  are the only ones I keep.  If there are more papers, crafts, and<br/>\n  treasures I had hoped to keep, then I put all the ones that I think<br/>\n  about keeping and organize them on my bed or wherever and take<br/>\n  a picture of them.  That way we don&#39;t have all that clutter and we<br/>\n  can still look back and remember the MEMORY which is really<br/>\n  what we are holding on to.&quot; -- Charity in NY<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;I keep a manila folder of assessments and anything special that<br/>\n  shows progress. For this year I have my son&#39;s kindergarten assess-<br/>\n  ment, a picture he drew that showed a huge leap in the art process,<br/>\n  a letter he wrote me (where love is spelled &#39;wof&#39;) and a couple math<br/>\n  sheets.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A friend takes pictures of her children&#39;s art projects and work and<br/>\n  makes them into a scrapbook with all important information such as<br/>\n  when it was created, what unit it was for, and anything her boys had<br/>\n  to say about the topic.&quot; -- Mia in MD<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;What I am doing this year is making a digital portfolio of my kids&#39;<br/>\n  work.  I&#39;m scanning or taking digital pictures of their work and<br/>\n  assignments and saving them on a disk.  This will save a ton of<br/>\n  storage space and is easy to share with friends and family.&quot; -- Pam<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;I&#39;ve always kept grades and samples of their work in every subject<br/>\n  as well as any testing scores, transcripts etc. I have a big thick<br/>\n  binder and put each year in it.  Several years can fit in one.  I<br/>\n  do not think it is necessary to keep all their work.&quot; -- Penny P.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;I live in Indiana and we are not required to save papers or keep a<br/>\n  portfolio... BUT, the representative for the state suggested that we<br/>\n  keep the previous year&#39;s papers till we have another year completed.<br/>\n  For example:  My daughter is in 5th grade.  In our file cabinet I have<br/>\n  all her 4th grade papers and I have started keeping her 5th grade<br/>\n  papers in another file.  When we are completed with the 5th grade<br/>\n  year, I will throw out the 4th grade papers.  This is not a state<br/>\n  regulation.  The representative just strongly suggested it in case we<br/>\n  were ever questioned by the state, so we would have some &#39;proof&#39; of<br/>\n  our school year.&quot; -- Martha D.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    =========================<br/>\n     Answer our NEW Question<br/>\n    =========================<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;I&#39;m sure you all experience burn-out from time to time.  I am in my<br/>\n  14th year of homeschooling.  I homeschooled my first born from<br/>\n  beginning to graduation last year and I have three more kids to go.<br/>\n  They are 9th grade, 6th grade, and 2nd grade.  So, as you can see,<br/>\n  I have a long way to go.  What I&#39;m experiencing now is more than<br/>\n  burn-out.  I love my kids and totally enjoy having them home with me<br/>\n  everyday, I just wish I didn&#39;t have to homeschool them.  We have<br/>\n  changed our curriculum and that has helped a bit.  We have lessened<br/>\n  the amount of running around with activities so that we&#39;re not so<br/>\n  hurried and stressed.  I know that God has called me to homeschool<br/>\n  my kids, so what else can I do?&quot; -- Noreen<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you have some encouragement or direction for Noreen?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please send your answer to:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HN-answers@...\">HN-answers@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    =====================<br/>\n     ASK YOUR QUESTION<br/>\n    =====================<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you have a question you would like our readers to answer?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Send it to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HN-questions@...\">HN-questions@...</a> and we&#39;ll see<br/>\n  if we can help you out in a future issue!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    =====================================<br/>\n       Our Searchable Newsletter Archive<br/>\n    =====================================<br/>\n<br/>\n  Access the Homeschool Notebook issues you have missed...<br/>\n  or search on a specific word or phrase in issues all the way<br/>\n  back to January 2001!
