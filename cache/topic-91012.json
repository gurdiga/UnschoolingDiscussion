She&#39;s almost asleep, cuddled right up against him. Sarah made my bed for me this morning, and helped me clean in the kitchen before breakfast. Right now she&#39;s working on addressing her Valentine&#39;s cards for her friends. Logan had helped at breakfast too, walking around with the trash can looking for trash. Megan also helped throw things away although not necessarily trash LOL!! <br/>\n <br/>\nEveryone was cheerful, and happy to help. Logan set the table for breakfast, Sarah helped cook. Gracie and Megan played... all day today so far really has just been a great day. I&#39;ve had time to sit and practice my flute. The kids came in and out of the room, and I&#39;d stop and let them blow on it a moment, then they&#39;d wander away. Logan came in with his drum, and Sarah her guitar (what&#39;s left of it LOL) and they &quot;played&quot; with me. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe Kipper DVD ended and Logan didn&#39;t have a cow begging for his turn to watch something of his choice...he just calmly asked if he could please watch Hot Wheels now. And I remembered that he likes to hear the opening song for awhile before starting the movie, so I said just tell me when you&#39;re ready to watch the movie. <br/>\n <br/>\nwow...this is great! Sarah&#39;s asking for me to read her a chapter of her history workbook that she&#39;d wanted to buy so we&#39;re going to go do that...<br/>\n <br/>\nLater!<br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n <br/>\nI am sitting here thinking what a wonderful morning we have had. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
