I think they  <br/>\ncould probably handle more than one family responding!  So if you  <br/>\n(parents or children either) would like to help some French boys with  <br/>\ntheir English, that would probably be fun for all involved.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Christine,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m the mother of two boys, Antoine, ten years old and Mathis, seven  <br/>\nyears old. My husband, Gontrand, has resigned this year to be more  <br/>\nfree for homeshooling. Now, we work together at home, and then, since  <br/>\ntwo weeks, we do homeschool !!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in the french Alpes. And, we want to travel all together, but  <br/>\nbefore, we would like too improve our english language. Antoine and  <br/>\nMathis are beginners but they enjoy so much to learn english, that  <br/>\nthey make up stories to remember the vocabulary... and I&#39;m not sure  <br/>\nto be good enought to rectify their syntaxe... I think it could be a  <br/>\nfantastic experience for all of us to have conversastions with  <br/>\nenglish people...<br/>\n<br/>\nAntoine and Mathis could send their english texte, and some of you or  <br/>\nchildren if it&#39;s possible, could answer them about what they  <br/>\nthink ... They could make up stories with english children !<br/>\n. . . .<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\n<br/>\nXine<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christine.evrard@...\">christine.evrard@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112825,"nextTopicId":112844}}
