Sorry. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well, there&#39;s hope. I used to be a packrat, and we have a fairly <br/>\n&gt; junk-free<br/>\n&gt; &gt; house now. The only thing I still have too many of is pictures and <br/>\n&gt; books,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but everything else is under control. My hubby is a neat freak who <br/>\n&gt; has won<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me over slowly but surely and weaned me off of my packrat ways. I <br/>\n&gt; come<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a long line of packrats though. We just spent the weekend at my <br/>\n&gt; mom&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; house<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (ugh!) and this cracked me up: she said to my son &quot;Don&#39;t step on <br/>\n&gt; that pile<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of magazines. Do you just stand all over the magazines at your own <br/>\n&gt; house?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In my mind I&#39;m thinking &quot;No mom, because we don&#39;t HAVE piles of <br/>\n&gt; magazines<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all over our house&quot;, honestly, the word &quot;childproofing&quot; means <br/>\n&gt; nothing to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her, she has piles of stuff everywhere and I have a 16 month old - <br/>\n&gt; ack!.<br/>\n&gt; My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grandma&#39;s house is worse. She can no longer use one of her <br/>\n&gt; bathrooms<br/>\n&gt; because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is full of stuff, and hasn&#39;t eaten a  meal on her dining room <br/>\n&gt; table in<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; least 15 years, it&#39;s been buried in stuff. She just has little <br/>\n&gt; pathways<br/>\n&gt; &gt; through everything, piles of old newspapers, magazines, sheet <br/>\n&gt; music, etc..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We don&#39;t go over there anymore. My niece (age 6) said the funniest <br/>\n&gt; thing<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; last time we were there, she said &quot;If there was an earthquake when <br/>\n&gt; we were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all visiting Grandma M&#39;s house, we&#39;d all die of paper cuts&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In any case, there&#39;s hope. I listened to a talk radio show on my <br/>\n&gt; way back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from my mom&#39;s house. It had the author of &quot;Clutter&#39;s Last Stand&quot; <br/>\n&gt; on as the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guest. He just wrote a new book called something like &quot;Lose 200 <br/>\n&gt; pounds<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weekend&quot; (meaning 200 pounds of stuff) and he had a bunch of great <br/>\n&gt; tips<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; de-cluttering, if anyone&#39;s interested...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Blue Skies!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    -Robin-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;This is a great life!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and Asa (10/5/99) Who walks backwards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; List settings page: <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
