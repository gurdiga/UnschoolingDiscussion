I think there is one truth - not 50 zillion - but it is up to the individual to find it. Sometimes you may never find it - but it is the act of looking for it that builds your character.  I don&#39;t think killing other people in the name of religion is the answer - obviously.  To me it appears very logical - if your religion preaches that it is necessary to hurt or rid the world of others that don&#39;t believe as you do - I would think you&#39;d start searching for the real truth. I know there are those out there who don&#39;t see this as absurd - there are always justifications. heck - the Pope is still apologizing for past wrongs -  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is interesting to discuss religious veiws ( I would like to know what the requirements for the Messiah were in the Old Testament  that weren&#39;t fuliflled by Jesus were?) but often both parties think they are right about opposite sides of a subject - and where is the meeting ground?  If you are truely searching for truth - or have found it...why the need to convince others that your way - is THE way? If they are meant to find it - they will - if they have another path - so be it.  But you can&#39;t find it by listening to someone tell you - you need to find it for yourself. It is in the same nature we discuss education. You can&#39;t TEACH a child - you can only lead them to the water - and let them drink - if they so choose. You can&#39;t make anyone see your way -  I guess you can &quot;strew&quot; but unless they want to find something for themselves - they won&#39;t. And they may teach you a thing or two along the way!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurningathome@...\">lurningathome@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 1:09 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2202<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 8/7/2002 7:40:14 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Christianity started in Israel because Jesus came to fulfill the <br/>\n  &gt; law.
