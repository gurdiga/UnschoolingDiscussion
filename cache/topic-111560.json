He is interested in<br/>\nvideo games and yugioh trading cards and tv. He only has 2 come to<br/>\nthe house friends and never goes to their house.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nsounds like he has plenty of motivation...just not in the things you<br/>\nmight want him to have. That&#39;s the most important part of unschooling,<br/>\nnot only tolerating their interests (which it sounds like you do) but<br/>\nappreciating them fully and seeing them as absolutely valid and worthy<br/>\nall on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool causes lack of motivation  in a lot of ways...he&#39;s had enough<br/>\nsquashing it sounds like, and you have a chance to give him back his<br/>\nlife. Forcing someone to do work they don&#39;t see as meaningful or show<br/>\ninterest in is the BEST way to kill motivation for life.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet him do the things he loves, treat the next few months like summer<br/>\nvacation (to help yourself deschool) so there isn&#39;t any pressure to<br/>\nperform. There is no &quot;only&quot;, they are his interests and they count big<br/>\ntime!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111487,"nextTopicId":111572}}
