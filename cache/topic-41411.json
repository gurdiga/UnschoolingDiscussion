Like I said before, I haven&#39;t taken <br/>\nmy kids to the circuses when they have come thru.  Mainly, b/c deep <br/>\nin my heart I was concerned about the animals also.  And I still am <br/>\nconcerned.  But I would venture to say that there is more to circuses <br/>\nthan the animals.  Perhaps you could even open the animal owners&#39; <br/>\neyes about their animals if you met them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We walked and talked with the trainers and the performers.  We met <br/>\ntheir children who homeschool (in a tutor type style) in RV&#39;s.    We <br/>\nmet and talked with a clown who made his electric car and costumes <br/>\nfrom scratch.  We learned about their animals (at least this <br/>\nfamily&#39;s) and the life style they lead in TX.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would venture to say that your son could also learn alot from <br/>\nthese people.  They live such a different lifestyle from us ordinary <br/>\nstationary home folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not to say there isn&#39;t animal abuse.  But these few families <br/>\nwe met really cared about their lifestyle and their animals.  They <br/>\nworked hard to answer our questions and show us everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t trade that day for anything b/c my kids and I learned so <br/>\nmuch. And who knows, maybe I&#39;ll take the kids to the circus someday <br/>\nand see someone I know.  And I can check up on the animals also.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., marji &lt;zintz@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi, Tina,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I appreciate the dialogue on this subject.
