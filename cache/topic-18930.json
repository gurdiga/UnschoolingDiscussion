I have two disabiling<br/>\nconditions that prevent me from working.  I have been trying to get Disability for a year now and<br/>\nhave been turned down twice.  I have finally had to get an attorney and I have a court date on May<br/>\n4th.  I ask humbly that all of you who will please cover me in prayer, especially on that day. <br/>\nThis is such an important thing to our family.  We really need the money.  I thank you for<br/>\nallowing this post and for your prayers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nRenee S.<br/>\n(Blessed Moma to Ryan 16, Austin 13, Carson 11 and Jessica Renee 5 1/2.
