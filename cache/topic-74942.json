Also known as Universal Law, for <br/>\nevery action there is an equal and/or opposite reaction or in simpler terms, <br/>\nwhatever one puts out, one receives back. In very simple terms: Be kind, receive <br/>\nkindness, share knowledge, receive knowledge, be cruel & expect cruelty. So, <br/>\nalthough it is based in the Laws of the Universe, the choice is yours as to what <br/>\nyou send out and what you will automatically be returned based on that <br/>\ninitial choice. The only problem being that not all actions and subsequent reactions <br/>\nnecessarily occur within the same lifetime.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to know more, just ask. Just remember, there are many points of <br/>\nview.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74731,"nextTopicId":74864}}
