I don&#39;t have a clue what will be right <br/>\nfor him when he hits 18. I loved college. My husband loved <br/>\ncollege. But we were products of 12 years of schooling. College <br/>\nwas the big reward for years of drudgery.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my son doesn&#39;t know if it will be a fit for him. This terrified me <br/>\nat first until I began really watching him. If I create a goal for him, <br/>\nthen I will work to enforce the requirements that goal demands. <br/>\nNext thing you know, I&#39;m back to organizing and controlling his <br/>\nlife. And he&#39;s back to putting his passions on hold for <br/>\nrequirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest encouragement to me was the realization that <br/>\nanyone can go to college... really. Colleges need students and <br/>\nmoney. Anyone can register as a special student, bypassing the <br/>\nadmissions process, proving that he or she is capable of <br/>\ncollege level work and then enrolling in a program. I&#39;m about to <br/>\ndo this very thing to get a Master&#39;s!<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I faced the fact that my son may not care about <br/>\nscholarships or admissions requirements but might some day <br/>\nchoose to go to college, I relaxed. He&#39;ll figure it out with my help if <br/>\nhe wants it when he catches the vision of what college might <br/>\nmean for his life. But right now, it&#39;s not in his line of sight as <br/>\nclearly as it was in mine so I&#39;m adjusting to that reality. He&#39;s got <br/>\nmore important things to do like:<br/>\n<br/>\nmastering Rachmaninoff pieces, Vanessa Carlotn&#39;s pop music, <br/>\nMozart and Scott Joplin on the piano. He&#39;s transposing songs for <br/>\nfun. He&#39;s created three games in Visual Baisc and hangs out <br/>\nonline with programmers. He reads voraciously and asked me <br/>\nto buy &quot;The Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; on tape last night at a book sale. <br/>\nHe acts in a Shakespeare camp every summer. He plays <br/>\nLacrosse and watches MTV and taught himself guitar and <br/>\nlistens to heavy metal. He plays with his siblings and is kind to <br/>\nthem. He cleans up the dishes just because they&#39;re dirty. He <br/>\nleaves his room a total mess all the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s a great kid! And if college is something *he* wants, I have <br/>\nno doubt he&#39;ll get there. And we&#39;ll do everything we can to help <br/>\nhim when he makes that choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just had to let go of thinking I could manage that goal for him. <br/>\nAnd I had to let go of meeting &#39;requuirements&#39; in order to see him <br/>\nblossom the way he has.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Another Newbie Climbing On Board","postDate":"1054738642","msgId":72112,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhMi4xNWE1NWE4Ny4yYzBmNjJkMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":72105,"nextInTopic":72115,"prevInTime":72111,"nextInTime":72113,"topicId":72105,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/4/03 8:38:49 AM, christina989@juno.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1460422734\">In a message dated 6/4/03 8:38:49 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christina989@...\">christina989@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  Don&#39;t I have to keep detailed records, assign<br/>\n&quot;credits&quot;, etc. in order to prepare transcripts to present to any<br/>\npotential college?   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo.  You can&#39;t give credit anyway.  Credit, from 9th grade on, is a real <br/>\n(within school-context) thing, only given by accredited schools.  So don&#39;t worry <br/>\nabout it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to invest some time and money (not much) go to google and look up <br/>\nCafi Cohen college  and you&#39;ll get info on a couple of books Cafi Cohen, a <br/>\nhomeschooling mom, has written on preparing applications for college.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s overkill, generally, unless HE wants college and you want to apply <br/>\nfor scholarships and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing (and could be wrong) that your vision of college is a four year <br/>\nblock of life that needs to start when he&#39;s 17 or 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can just undo that vision, you&#39;ll both be vastly happier.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he&#39;ll want to take a college class when he&#39;s 14 or 16, just to see what <br/>\nit&#39;s like.  Maybe there are continuuing ed or community ed classes around <br/>\nthere that aren&#39;t &quot;academic&quot; (photography, local fauna, rock climbing) that he <br/>\nmight enjoy for meeting people and doing something different, or maybe he wants <br/>\nto be away from schoolish stuff altogether for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to chill for a year.  Act like you&#39;re on vacation.  Sometimes do a <br/>\ntouristy thing that you would do if you were visiting wherever you are (or had out <br/>\nof town company) but that locals rarely do because it&#39;s expensive.  In <br/>\nAlbuquerque, that would be have lunch on Sandid Crest, having ridden the Tram up.  <br/>\nMaybe do an overnight vacation to a play or musical or touring museum show in <br/>\nanother town.  Stay in a motel, or with friends, or camp (or sleep in the van), <br/>\nbut make it an adventure.

When I first pulled him out of school, I<br/>\nplayed the good little teacher, sat him down, presented applicable<br/>\nmaterials for his age, etc., etc.  He did his work, albeit grudgingly<br/>\nmost of the time, but I didn&#39;t see any motivation kicking in (still<br/>\nworking on desensitizing him from his public school experience).  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t realize it until I started reading about unschooling and joined<br/>\nyour great group, but I think that I have been unschooling during the<br/>\nlast half of this school year, and we&#39;re both more relaxed about the<br/>\nwhole thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy concern now is how to unschool during high school, especially since<br/>\nI&#39;d like to see him in college (he doesn&#39;t want to see himself there -<br/>\n&quot;hates&quot; school, but I think he&#39;ll come around when he sees how much fun<br/>\ntrue learning really is).
