We went clothes shopping<br/>\nthe other day and I decided to let her put just about everything she wanted<br/>\nin the cart.  Then I went to a quiet corner in the store and asked her to<br/>\npick 2 things.  We talked about why she picked those 2 things and she<br/>\nchanged her mind on one of them, not sure why but any how, she was very<br/>\nhappy with the 2 things she picked.  Unfortunately, I forgot completely<br/>\nabout giving her money to buy it herself.  I think she would enjoy that.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s 4, a little shy but very articulate.  I seem to be feeling the need to<br/>\nmake this more complicated than it probably needs to be.  She isn&#39;t asking<br/>\nfor money yet, or to buy things herself.
