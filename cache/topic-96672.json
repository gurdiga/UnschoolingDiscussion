I was just stating what I had learned about chicken pox in response to what someone had said about how it could be serious. Frankly, I think 12 deaths in a population of 30 million where almost everybody gets the disease is very, very small and not worth a widespread vaccination program (That doesn&#39;t sound right, sounds uncaring about those deaths I know). My son was vaccinated but I wish I&#39;d read more (though I&#39;m not sure my decision would have been different). Catherine made the choice not to have the chicken pox vaccine after we talked about it and I&#39;m fine with that (though I did not give her the same choice about other vaxes unfortunately). They&#39;ve both had all the vaxs the province reccomends and I&#39;m satified that it did not harm them. I&#39;m not satisfied about having made the right choice however as I did very little research. One thing I&#39;ve come to realize is that because a decision did no harm does NOT mean it was the right one or made properly. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Questioning experts, was Re: chicken pox","postDate":"1091117599","msgId":97049,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzI5MTYxMzE5LjI0NDY2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzODAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFkYi4yNzgyNmUxZC4yZTNhNzc2MUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":97047,"nextInTopic":97050,"prevInTime":97048,"nextInTime":97050,"topicId":96672,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"People can go along to get along.

As illnesses go, not so bad, tho the itching drove me crazy.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIn high school, my friend next door had them at 15, and it was awful -- she had them in her mouth, inside her ears -- virtually everywhere and she was miserable.  I was told it was because of her age.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIn more recent years, a cousin of mine had them at 9, very similar to my friend above -- pox in her mouth and throat, etc.  An neighbor&#39;s son had them at age 10 (just after being vaxxed to prevent them) and was miserable, very sick. His younger brother, then 3yo, had a very mild case.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI think, just like with any illness, there are a lot of factors.  Probably everything from one&#39;s age, to current health status, to diet, and overall constitution.  Two years ago at our house, we had a virus run thru -- Dan (16mos then) landed in the hospital. Gary and the other boys (6 & 17) threw up for a couple of days. My Mom was sick for almost a week. I never caught it, tho I tended to everyone except my Mom.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s part of why I&#39;m not really all that worried by the vax-preventable illnesses.  It&#39;s all a big crapshoot, anyway.  Keep the kids as healthy as you can, and hope for the best.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe only one that concerns me is Rubella, for its risk to pregnant women. If I had a daughter, I&#39;d tell her about the risks measles while pregnant so she could choose to be vaxed, and that it might be a good idea for her partner to also be vaxed by the time they want children.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n******<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nIs this another modern day myth?  I hear people say it is worse to get chicken pox when you&#39;re older, but I know at least one toddler who had a horrible case - so I know it can be worse for some younger children too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!

I&#39;m going to have to look that up...<br/>\n<br/>\n~Andrea<br/>\n<br/>\nAhh...here is something from Indiana University Health Center:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is shingles?<br/>\nShingles is a painful skin eruption caused by the varicella zoster virus,<br/>\nthe same virus that causes chicken pox. The virus remains dormant in a nerve<br/>\nroot near the spinal cord after chicken pox. Fatigue,emotional upsets,<br/>\nimmune suppressive drugs (such as corticosteriods), radiation therapy or<br/>\nunknown factors cause the virus to reactivate. When it reactivates, it<br/>\ntravels down the nerve to the skin. Anyone can get shingles if they have had<br/>\nchicken pox but it is more likely to occur in older people.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are symptoms of shingles?<br/>\nPain usually begins along the nerve before the rash appears. Itching,<br/>\nburning or weakness in the associated muscles may also be present. The rash<br/>\nusually develops within a few days after the pain begins. The rash appears<br/>\nas groups of small blisters on the skin along the nerve tract.This often<br/>\noccurs on one side of the chest or face, but may appear on any part of the<br/>\nbody. The blisters crust and heal during the next two weeks. Pain may<br/>\npersist for weeks or sometimes months after the rash heals.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreatment<br/>\nAntiviral medications such as acyclovir can be used to reduce the pain and<br/>\npromote healing if started early in the course of illness. Pain relief<br/>\nmedicine and soothing soaks or lotions may also be used.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154033277,"authorName":"Crystal","from":"&quot;Crystal&quot; &lt;crystal.pina@...&gt;","profile":"crystalinma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Chicken Pox","postDate":"1091109982","msgId":97041,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNlYjA4dStsYjFsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDcwMWM0NzU3MyRmZGJiMGVjMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":97040,"nextInTopic":97042,"prevInTime":97040,"nextInTime":97042,"topicId":96672,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... chicken pox ...

So do cars and boats and planes and we don&#39;t <br/>\nall fear them and avoid them although some people die each year. It <br/>\nis tragic, of course, but assuming that we &quot;prevent&quot; deaths with <br/>\nvaccines, which also have serious risks, is like never riding in a <br/>\nvehicle to prevent accidents. Everything has to be weighed for its <br/>\npros and cons based on your best information. Health care, like any <br/>\nlife decision, has no guarantees. Security is a superstition. <br/>\n<br/>\nBe informed, see the CDC site about disease occurances, severity, age <br/>\nof greatest risks, and vaccines side-effects for yourself. <br/>\nExtrapolate these numbers for all Americans (274 million) and 3.7 <br/>\nmillion babies born in 2000, 72 million children under 18 (US census <br/>\ndata). Read the government&#39;s vaccine adverse events reporting system <br/>\non line at VAERS.org. You will be astounded at the number and <br/>\nseverity of events reported to be corrolated with the vaccines <br/>\ncompared to the number of children vaccinated. (Approximately 26 <br/>\nvaccines per child by age 4).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe huge number of vaccines multiplies the risk of an adverse effect <br/>\nevery time the child is exposed to the toxins in the vaccines. See <br/>\nvaccine ingredients on-line, some of these are known neurotoxins. It <br/>\nisn&#39;t too incomprehensible why parents of autistic children and <br/>\nscientists are questioning if the vaccines are not corrolated in the <br/>\ndramatic increase in newly diagnosed autism (0.3/10,000 to 2.1/10,000 <br/>\ncases: 1100 case in 1988 to 7700 cases in 1999. A sevenfold increase <br/>\nin 10 years. (See autism incidence on-line). Just as the number of <br/>\nvaccines &quot;required&quot; with mercury and other toxic ingredients have <br/>\nincreased dramatically. <br/>\n<br/>\nMind you after 30-40 years of mercury in our children&#39;s vaccines the <br/>\nsystem has recently decided it might be safer to remove it. No <br/>\nadmission that it isn&#39;t safe to inject thimerosal (mercury) into <br/>\npeople. (Many adult vaccines still have mercury, and are even given <br/>\nto pregnant women!) How much mercury is too much for any one <br/>\nindividual infant, child or fetus?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it too late for many children? YOU have to decide as the parent, <br/>\nor let your child decide when she or he can understand the risks and <br/>\npotential benefits of vaccination. What other practice and <br/>\ninstitutions do we sheepishly follow without questioning in America <br/>\nthan the vaccines and education system? Doctors and teachers are not <br/>\nthe experts for all knowledge. Question assumptions and conclusions, <br/>\nyours, theirs and mine. Injections are permanent choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nCritical thinking. Yes, even in of most ingrained belief systems. I <br/>\nknow, I was part of the medical system.

I only had about 20 spots, on my back and side, and I thought it <br/>\nwas chigger bites or something because I&#39;d been camping.  But it turned out the <br/>\nlittle boy who was camping with us came down with big chicken pox that week <br/>\ntoo, and my case was just quite mild. I was a little woozy and slightly <br/>\nfeverish, but there were midterm tests to take, and I went but sat in the back away <br/>\nfrom others.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStudent health left a message for me to call them, and I got told off for <br/>\ngoing to class.

My friend <br/>\nCarol (who wrote the thing about late reading) had her kids get it in series, <br/>\nso it took two months.  Like clockwork, after two weeks one more would break <br/>\nout, but not three; then two weeks later one more, not two.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe babysat the sickies sometimes because my kids had already had it, except <br/>\nHolly and we didn&#39;t mind her getting it.  Her case was bad in that there were <br/>\nlots of spots, in ears, everywhere.  She pretty much lived in the tub.  She was <br/>\nlittle.  She played with a sock full of oatmeal, and we put calamine on <br/>\nafter, and the whole drawn out deal.  It seems like it will last forever on day <br/>\nthree, but it doesn&#39;t ultimately last long at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela","from":"Angela &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Chicken Pox","postDate":"1091059543","msgId":97024,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzI5MDAwNTQyLlZGSkgyODYwOS5tdGExMy5hZGVscGhpYS5uZXRAbWFpbC5hZGVscGhpYS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":97023,"nextInTopic":97026,"prevInTime":97023,"nextInTime":97025,"topicId":96672,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I had them as a 6 month old baby and I had them really bad.
