But as<br/>\n&gt;            the two people who designed the basic architecture and the core<br/>\n&gt;            protocols that make the Internet work, we would like to<br/>\nacknowledge<br/>\n&gt;            VP Gore&#39;s contributions as a Congressman, Senator and as Vice<br/>\n&gt;            President. No other elected official, to our knowledge, has<br/>\nmade a<br/>\n&gt;            greater contribution over a longer period of time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;            Last year the Vice President made a straightforward statement<br/>\non his<br/>\n&gt;            role. He said: &quot;During my service in the United States Congress<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt;            took the initiative in creating the Internet.&quot; We don&#39;t think,<br/>\nas some<br/>\n&gt;            people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he &quot;invented&quot;<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt;            Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that<br/>\nwhile<br/>\n&gt;            serving as Senator, Gore&#39;s initiatives had a significant and<br/>\n&gt;            beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet. The fact of<br/>\nthe matter<br/>\n&gt;            is that Gore was talking about and promoting the Internet long<br/>\n&gt;            before most people were listening. We feel it is timely to<br/>\noffer our<br/>\n&gt;            perspective.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;            As far back as the 1970s Congressman Gore promoted the idea of<br/>\n&gt;            high speed telecommunications as an engine for both economic<br/>\n&gt;            growth and the improvement of our educational system. He was<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt;            first elected official to grasp the potential of computer<br/>\n&gt;            communications to have a broader impact than just improving the<br/>\n&gt;            conduct of science and scholarship. Though easily forgotten,<br/>\nnow, at<br/>\n&gt;            the time this was an unproven and controversial concept. Our<br/>\nwork<br/>\n&gt;            on the Internet started in 1973 and was based on even earlier<br/>\nwork<br/>\n&gt;            that took place in the mid-late 1960s. But the Internet, as we<br/>\nknow it<br/>\n&gt;            today, was not deployed until 1983. When the Internet was still<br/>\nin the<br/>\n&gt;            early stages of its deployment, Congressman Gore provided<br/>\n&gt;            intellectual leadership by helping create the vision of the<br/>\npotential<br/>\n&gt;            benefits of high speed computing and communication. As an<br/>\n&gt;            example, he sponsored hearings on how advanced technologies<br/>\n&gt;            might be put to use in areas like coordinating the response of<br/>\n&gt;            government agencies to natural disasters and other crises.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;            As a Senator in the 1980s Gore urged government agencies to<br/>\n&gt;            consolidate what at the time were several dozen different and<br/>\n&gt;            unconnected networks into an &quot;Interagency Network.&quot; Working in<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt;            bi-partisan manner with officials in Ronald Reagan and George<br/>\n&gt;            Bush&#39;s administrations, Gore secured the passage of the High<br/>\n&gt;            Performance Computing and Communications Act in 1991. This<br/>\n&gt;            &quot;Gore Act&quot; supported the National Research and Education<br/>\nNetwork<br/>\n&gt;            (NREN) initiative that became one of the major vehicles for the<br/>\n&gt;            spread of the Internet beyond the field of computer science.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;            As Vice President Gore promoted building the Internet both up<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt;            out, as well as releasing the Internet from the control of the<br/>\n&gt;            government agencies that spawned it. He served as the major<br/>\n&gt;            administration proponent for continued investment in advanced<br/>\n&gt;            computing and networking and private sector initiatives such as<br/>\nNet<br/>\n&gt;            Day. He was and is a strong proponent of extending access to<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt;            network to schools and libraries. Today, approximately 95% of<br/>\nour<br/>\n&gt;            nation&#39;s schools are on the Internet. Gore provided much-needed<br/>\n&gt;            political support for the speedy privatization of the Internet<br/>\nwhen the<br/>\n&gt;            time arrived for it to become a commercially-driven operation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;            There are many factors that have contributed to the Internet&#39;s<br/>\nrapid<br/>\n&gt;            growth since the later 1980s, not the least of which has been<br/>\n&gt;            political support for its privatization and continued support<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt;            research in advanced networking technology. No one in public<br/>\nlife<br/>\n&gt;            has been more intellectually engaged in helping to create the<br/>\nclimate<br/>\n&gt;            for a thriving Internet than the Vice President. Gore has been<br/>\na clear<br/>\n&gt;            champion of this effort, both in the councils of government and<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt;            the public at large.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;            The Vice President deserves credit for his early recognition of<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt;            value of high speed computing and communication and for his<br/>\n&gt;            long-term and consistent articulation of the potential value of<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt;            Internet to American citizens and industry and, indeed, to the<br/>\nrest of<br/>\n&gt;            the world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &quot;FORGIVE YOUR ENEMIES BUT REMEMBER THEIR NAMES&quot;<br/>\n&gt; FREE LEONARD PELTIER<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.petitiononline.com/Clemency/petition.html\">http://www.petitiononline.com/Clemency/petition.html</a><br/>\n&gt; FreeFax-Leonard Peltier <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bearvisions.com/Justice/FaxLetter.html\">http://www.bearvisions.com/Justice/FaxLetter.html</a><br/>\n&gt; Mascot Petition: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.setaim.com/setaim_petition.html\">http://www.setaim.com/setaim_petition.html</a><br/>\n&gt; American Indian National Holiday:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.petitiononline.com/indian/petition.html\">http://www.petitiononline.com/indian/petition.html</a><br/>\n&gt; Republican Resolution:  petition<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://community.wolfstar.com/sc-aim/republicans.html\">http://community.wolfstar.com/sc-aim/republicans.html</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Stop George W Bush from being the President of Death&lt;<br/>\n&gt; NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOT LINE<br/>\n&gt; 24 Hour Hotline Toll Free: 1-877-633-1112<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thehungersite.com/\">http://www.thehungersite.com/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Free Unlimited Internet Access!
