There are plenty of interesting ideas, but a tendency by a few<br/>\nto say &quot;That&#39;s not unschooling!&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s not valid.&quot;  It would make a<br/>\nlot more sense to say, &quot; I got what you said, but I see it<br/>\ndifferently....&quot; Or ask questions as you suggest. But it happened to me<br/>\nwhen I first jumped in. Even when I posted again, I got back some absurd<br/>\npost from one person suggesting I had done, thought, viewed things a way<br/>\nI had not, and she wasn&#39;t interested or gonna ask me what I thought!<br/>\nAnyway, I decided to mainly lurk and take what ideas I respected and<br/>\nwanted, but not really post or not much - because there are a vocal few<br/>\nwho seem more interested in their own pat answers than new thoughts or<br/>\nexchange to develop ideas further. .. My actual views are probably way<br/>\nmore radical than anyone here could actually stomach. <br/>\nOh, well. I still enjoy quite a few of the posts.
