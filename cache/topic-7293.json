We got the still air<br/>\nincubators & the eggs from the extension agent and a short lesson from<br/>\nsomeone with the University.  My children quickly bored with turning the<br/>\neggs 3 times a day (they were at that time 6 & 2) so I did all &quot;the work&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did not hatch any of our eggs....all the literature we received from the<br/>\nextension office said they would hatch in 21 days.  At day 24 I got rid of<br/>\nthe eggs because I was afraid they would hatch & the chicks would be<br/>\nmalformed.  Later I found out from others in my group that their eggs were<br/>\nvery late in hatching.  I think our eggs were &quot;old&quot; since even those who<br/>\nwaited long enough only got aprx 2-5 chicks from 15 eggs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my advice, don&#39;t give up too soon.  I&#39;m sure we would have had chicks if<br/>\nwe had waited another day or so.  Also, be aware that you can&#39;t go out of<br/>\ntown without getting someone to &quot;babysit&quot; the eggs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur brooder was a very sturdy cardboard box with shredded newspaper and a<br/>\nclip on light above it.  Even though the kids tired of turning the eggs they<br/>\nwere VERY disappointed when we did not get chicks, they talked about them<br/>\nall the time.  Planned for them all the time.  So I&#39;m sure your family will<br/>\nenjoy the experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7290,"nextTopicId":7295}}
