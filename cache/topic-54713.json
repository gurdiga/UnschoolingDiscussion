According to Jewish Law it is not murder, but<br/>\nit is akin to murder; it is allowable when the health of the mother would be<br/>\nseverely compromised, and I&#39;m not certain there is an actual choice about it<br/>\n(according to Jewish law.). This is, of course, if you are Jewish.  Women,<br/>\nwho have sought out their Rabbi&#39;s for permission, have received the right to<br/>\nan abortion for myriad of reasons, which are based on the person. Everyone<br/>\nis unique. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI can see helping someone make an alternate choice, but to do so I must<br/>\nreally be willing to find them other solutions for the reason they are<br/>\nseeking the abortion and be willing to step aside respectfully if they deem<br/>\nmy help inadequate to meet their needs, and choose something else, including<br/>\nabortion.  I don&#39;t think most people like abortions; it is a matter, for<br/>\nmost who make the choice of needs.  Of the women I know who have had them,<br/>\nthey do not regret; they may wish circumstances were different so they could<br/>\nhave gone on to have the baby, but they do not regret.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI can not see the logic of abortion being equivalent to murder from<br/>\nconception on, or every woman who has an early natural abortion has had<br/>\nsomeone die.  Do we bury the remains of our cycle, because perhaps there is<br/>\na conception in there? The chances that a woman has had an extremely early<br/>\nmiscarriage are quite high...I don&#39;t remember the statistics on it....as far<br/>\nas I know I have not, but then have you ever had a late period? One heavy<br/>\nthan normal? \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy child and my unborn child are different in an emotional, and I feel legal<br/>\nsense.  I guess I see it this way; were I drowning, and my child drowning, <br/>\nand a choice must be made,  please save my child. Even if I&#39;m pregnant. Even<br/>\nif the baby is about to be born.
