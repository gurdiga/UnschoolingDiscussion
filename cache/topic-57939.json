Her big interests are &quot;babies&quot;  babysitting, <br/>\nanything to do with small children. And she loves to sew too.  She got books <br/>\nat the library about babysitting and we signed her up for a Red Cross baby <br/>\nsitting class.. And,shes signed up for a 4-H sewing class.    I did make her <br/>\na &quot;lesson plan&quot;  She looked at it and said. (making a face) I dont really <br/>\nwant to do this.  So, she didnt.. She made herself a &quot;reading schedule&quot;  of <br/>\nbooks she wanted to ( was already) reading.. She followed it for a couple of <br/>\ndays.   She was soooo &quot;sucesss/pleasing others&quot; oriented.. She liked getting <br/>\nassignments, having tasks ect and completing them to feel successful.. I told <br/>\nher I can certainly do all of that for her.. But she says.. Mom, your not a <br/>\nteacher, I dont feel like I HAVE to do the stuff.. I said.. well, you really <br/>\ndont.  And when she was in school. I never made her feel like she HAD do <br/>\nthings.. I was very lax about school work.  Sometimes she would get all upset <br/>\nif she was late with a project or she got a B.. I was like.. oh, come on, <br/>\nAnna, its fine..dont sweat it.  Her determination came from her own <br/>\nvolition..not something I projected on to her.  Thats just the kind of girl <br/>\nshe is.  I am trying to help her, guide her, support her into seeing how <br/>\nvaluable SHE is, as a person,  that her worth comes from HER not from her <br/>\ngrades and her accomplishments..  I have no doubt.. she will always strive to <br/>\nexcel in anything she does.  I expect when she takes the sewing class,  she <br/>\nwill not be satisfied til her project is perfect.   Thats just Anna.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57986,"nextTopicId":57887}}
