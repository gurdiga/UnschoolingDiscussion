That way he can <br/>\ntouch/observe to his heart&#39;s content. Eric ds carries some in his backpack. I <br/>\ncan&#39;t say he always uses them, but he knows to wash his hands thoroughly <br/>\nwhether using gloves or not.<br/>\nEric has an entire shelf in his room dedicated to his nature collection. This <br/>\nincludes the head of a woodpecker, decomposed lizards and frogs, an <br/>\noppossum&#39;s skull, multiple insect exoskeletons, a hummingbird, crawfish <br/>\nclaws, owl pellets (found, not purchased), along with many other items. <br/>\nYesterday, I found a dead bat on the front porch. Last week, it was an entire <br/>\nnest of decomposing baby birds. These are all being kept sheltered from <br/>\nweather outside. When he finds something in the woods, he has to keep it <br/>\noutside until it completely dries out/decomposes. That avoids the stink in <br/>\nour house. <br/>\nThis collection is fascinating. There are ways to let his curiosity blossom <br/>\nwithout exposing him to diseases. <br/>\nAnother website that he might enjoy is     <br/>\nwww.d91.k12.id.us/www/skyline/teachers/robertsd/skulls.htm   called Animal <br/>\nSkull Collection by Deloy Roberts. Animal identification based on skeletons. <br/>\nIf you find a skeleton, the site helps you ID. Really cool.<br/>\nHold your breath, wear gloves, keep it outside until the stench is gone, and <br/>\nlet him enjoy. Take a walk in the woods with him; you never know what you&#39;ll <br/>\nfind. <br/>\n<br/>\nGinny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":52490229,"authorName":"Leslie Avery","from":"Leslie Avery &lt;ljbakavery@...&gt;","profile":"ljbakavery","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] re :unschooling-dotcom: new interests-help","postDate":"1030067931","msgId":41782,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwODIzMDE1ODUxLjcyOTEwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTEwLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PE9FMTM5NjE3ZnZpS04zdTB3bFQwMDAyYmY1MkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":41775,"nextInTopic":41819,"prevInTime":41781,"nextInTime":41783,"topicId":41770,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter and I just finished dissecting a frog online.
