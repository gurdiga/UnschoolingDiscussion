ME, sometimes.  I have one quiet child, who really is a thinker, more <br/>\nthan a doer.  He just turned 5 recently, and is going through a profound, <br/>\nthoughtful stage.  Very interesting questions and observations bubble out of <br/>\nhim off and on throughout the day.  So I have some evidence that he is <br/>\nthinking, thinking, thinking.  Yet I can look at him and just think he is <br/>\nsitting or vegetating.<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking is invisible.

They are &quot;loafing&quot; or &quot;goofing off&quot;.<br/>\nMy middle daughter (Angie) went through this in March of this year. Angie <br/>\ndecided that she should go back to school. The conversation went something <br/>\nlike this:<br/>\nAngie:&quot;Mom, I am not learning anything!&quot;<br/>\nMe:&quot;Yes you are. You&#39;re learning all the time.&quot;<br/>\nAngie:&quot;No I&#39;m not. You don&#39;t teach us anything.&quot;<br/>\nMe:&quot;I am not the teacher. You can learn on your own.&quot;<br/>\nAngie:&quot;This is sick. You&#39;re gonna get caught.&quot;<br/>\nMe:&quot;Angie, I&#39;ve told you about unschooling.&quot;<br/>\nAngie:&quot;Yeah, mom, but we don&#39;t DO anything!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSee what I mean? In her 8 short years of p.s., she had been brainwashed into <br/>\nthinking that she was doing &quot;nothing&quot;. She still is not &quot;comfortable&quot; with <br/>\nthe idea of unschooling. She is doing better with the idea since the <br/>\n&quot;assessment&quot;. Now she brags to her friends, &quot;We&#39;re still on summer vacation <br/>\nfrom LAST year.&quot; LOL!<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why it&#39;s easier for some people to accept unschooling fully and <br/>\nlet go of those &quot;schoolish&quot; ideas of learning. I know that Angie has always <br/>\nbeen a &quot;worrier&quot;.<br/>\nIt came easy for me, as it did Angie&#39;s sisters. I just know that &quot;old habits <br/>\ndie hard&quot;.<br/>\nI really do think that school is evil. I just wish I would have listened to <br/>\nAngie when she came home one day in first grade and said, &quot;I hate school. <br/>\nCould you homeschool me?&quot; It&#39;s my biggest regret in life--leaving her in <br/>\nschool for almost 8 years.<br/>\nMary Ellen.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":905,"nextTopicId":901}}
