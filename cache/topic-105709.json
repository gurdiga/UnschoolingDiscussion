I<br/>\ndon&#39;t mind taking time to explain over and over again until he<br/>\nunderstands. But he gets soooo upset and I feel so bad for him.  And so<br/>\noften I (or dh or Charles) end up getting upset.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just going to throw out a couple of thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I think this is very normal.  There is an age range where a lot of<br/>\npeople have a hard time asking exactly what they want and where they have<br/>\na hard time applying what they&#39;re hearing to what they already think.   I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think this is an emotional problem or barrier or anything like<br/>\nthat.  I think it&#39;s just normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, it might be part of your normal family style of communication.  You<br/>\nmention others get upset too, so maybe this is the way your family<br/>\ncommunicates.  Maybe you&#39;re all easily frustrated when things don&#39;t go<br/>\nexactly how you expect and he&#39;s mirroring that or it&#39;s part of his<br/>\ngenetic make up. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, paying attention to how you&#39;re answering his questions might give<br/>\nyou some clues.  Is he getting a superficial answer when he&#39;s looking for<br/>\nsomething deep and meaningful?  Is he getting more explanation than he<br/>\nwants?  Sometime when you&#39;re *not* watching anything ask him what he<br/>\nthinks.  Mention you notice he gets frustrated and ask what you can do to<br/>\nmake that whole question/answer process easier for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid and Dylan had a hard time communicating and often over questions<br/>\nabout movie or book happenings.  <br/>\nDavid would give a simple answer.  &quot;He jumped off the building because he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want those guys to catch him.&quot; <br/>\nWell, Dylan knew that much.  He wanted to know *why* the guy thought<br/>\njumping was the best choice.  Why couldn&#39;t he try to run past them?  Why<br/>\ndidn&#39;t he kick them and get away?  What was he so afraid of if they<br/>\ncaught him?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he just doesn&#39;t like what he&#39;s watching.  Maybe he&#39;d like to go do<br/>\nsomething else but doesn&#39;t want to do it by himself.  Could you offer to<br/>\ngo play a game with him instead?   <br/>\n<br/>\nJust some ideas that may or may not help you. Dylan was like this at<br/>\nabout that age and it sorted itself out with a lot of talking and<br/>\nunderstanding and some time.  He&#39;s the one explaining most things to us,<br/>\nnow. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n&quot;Destiny has her hand on my back and she&#39;s pushing!&quot;<br/>\n~The Tick~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105743,"nextTopicId":105745}}
