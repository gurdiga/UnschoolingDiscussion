I let my emotions run ahead of <br/>\nmy brain. I don&#39;t know how many times I have cautioned others to avoid <br/>\ngetting too involved or personal with their posts. (not that that is always a <br/>\nbad thing, but not often a good thing either.) I am very sorry, especially <br/>\nfor my closing statement of &quot;Good-bye to the nastiness. Good-bye to all.&quot; <br/>\nVery melodramatic, Scarlet O&#39;Harish, on my part. I really should have taken a <br/>\nday or more to cool off, and I probably wouldn&#39;t have even felt the need to <br/>\nrespond to that particular post. Most times, I do just that. I read a post <br/>\nthat angers me, I put it aside and come back later to reread it and look at <br/>\nit more objectively. In this case I haven&#39;t reread the (inferred) post, I <br/>\nreread my own. It was, in short, crap. Sure, we all get our feelings hurt, <br/>\nbut we don&#39;t all act like I did, and for that I am very sorry. I still think <br/>\nI need to take a break, and I will. Many of you have written (very nicely and <br/>\nI thank you all for your kind words.) to ask me to reconsider unsubscribing. <br/>\nI haven&#39;t, but I will remain on lurking status for awhile, for my own good. &lt;g<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>~A Mollified Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41081,"nextTopicId":41066}}
