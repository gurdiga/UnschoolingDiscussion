If you get a full-sized <br/>\nfour octave or five octave (rarer), you yourself can play lots of &quot;real&quot; <br/>\npiano music (I sometimes go off the top end with Bach, and I don&#39;t really <br/>\nlike 19th and early 20th century stuff, so that big range isn&#39;t a problem for <br/>\nme personally).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can act with your kids, playing around--doing impressions.

Lily <br/>\nTomlin.  Steve Martin.  The Marx Brothers.  Jim Carrey.  Dana Carvey.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to pay for acting lessons or buy a horribly expensive real <br/>\npiano to see whether a child wants to pursue something.  You can expose them <br/>\nto more examples and you can provide them with materials/ideas/experiences <br/>\nvery inexpensively at home.  If they get to the point that they MUST do and <br/>\nhave more, they&#39;ll definitely let you know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just my opinion, really, truly.
