So many times I&#39;ve had to defend my<br/>\nposition on TV and other non-traditional forms of learning activities.   I<br/>\nlet my children watch all sorts of Movies, because their attention span has<br/>\ngrown huge leaps and bonds and it helps their imagination take off.  My<br/>\nThree year old wants to learn all he can about Dinosaurs, and knows words<br/>\nlike Tyrannosaurus Rex, and Pterodactyl because of movies like Jurassic<br/>\nPark, and We&#39;re Back.  Television has given me some of the best<br/>\nopportunities to discuss things like being nice, getting frustrated, the<br/>\nsolar system and so much more with my 5 year old.  Shows like Blue&#39;s Clues<br/>\ndiscusses EVERYTHING!  We love it.  The Disney Channel, Nick Jr. and the<br/>\nDiscovery channel are great discussion starters... heck even the dumb<br/>\ncartoons from my childhood on the Cartoon network can start discussions on<br/>\nthings like how to react to dumb situations, and how cartoons have changed<br/>\nwith computer animation.  It&#39;s all about what you choose to discuss with<br/>\nyour kids.
