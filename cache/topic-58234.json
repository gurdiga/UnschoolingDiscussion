I got the kids(5 of them, ages 12 to 3)<br/>\nup (we had to be out of the house early today) and they had breakfast.  The<br/>\noldest 2 and I fed all the animals while the little kids cuddled under<br/>\nblankets and watched a movie.  We fed 2 dogs and 8 goats, milked the goats.<br/>\nAdriane figured out how much milk her goat gave and recorded it.  Zach<br/>\nhelped figure how much his goat ate and recorded it and I did this for mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got everyone dressed and headed into town for play practice.  The kids<br/>\nnot involved in the play spent time with their friends in another room,<br/>\nchit-chatting about movies and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe came home and had lunch.  Adriane turned the soap she is making for the<br/>\ncounty homemaking fair.  Zach is listening to cds on the playstation and his<br/>\nlittle brother is singing along.  This afternoon the little kids will go<br/>\nplay with friends and the bigger kids and I will go to a 4-H meeting.  Then<br/>\nsome of the other kids are off to friends&#39; houses for the evening to play.<br/>\nThe rest of us will probably straighten up the house and play games.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58082,"nextTopicId":58235}}
