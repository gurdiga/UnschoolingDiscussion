But do you believe that they have a say in how it&#39;s spent<br/>\nnow? I&#39;ve been going to school board meetings and listening to how school<br/>\nemployees treat parents for years, and I must agree with the careful<br/>\nobservers who say that the schools do whatever suits them with no regard<br/>\nwhatsoever to what the public wants or what is best for the children, unless<br/>\nit happens to boost the school spending or employment roster.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne author says that schools consider parents to be &quot;unenlightened,<br/>\nbothersome appendages&quot; to the children.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for retired and childless people, Why not include homeschoolers and those<br/>\nwho send their kids to private schools. Do we (they) get a say in how school<br/>\nfunds are spent? Heck no. More than likely, we are told that we are<br/>\n&quot;interlopers&quot; and &quot;anti-education meddlers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone tell us why any of those groups should be forced to pay for the<br/>\npublic schools? (yes, I&#39;m familiar with the &quot;public good&quot; argument, but<br/>\nthere are lots of public goods that people are taxed for.)<br/>\n<br/>\nShould we not discuss this? Whose money is it? We are among the people who<br/>\npay, but are not allowed to say how the money is spent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we can discuss something so absurdly impertinent as Hell -- without<br/>\nprotest -- why not this, which affects us all.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ned Vare<br/>\nNo good deed goes unpunished.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40760,"nextTopicId":40763}}
