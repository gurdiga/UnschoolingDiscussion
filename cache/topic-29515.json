I&#39;m lucky <br/>\nto live very near an unschooling family with 3 children.  They are all <br/>\nolder than mine by a couple or few years.  It only takes me a half hour <br/>\nto walk to her house.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do lots of stuff together.  I have learned much from her.  She truly <br/>\nis a natural.  She&#39;s hasn&#39;t read any books about unschooling, but she <br/>\nreally knows what she&#39;s doing.  It&#39;s all by instinct.  I, on the other <br/>\nhand, learned from books.  This is not something that came naturally to <br/>\nme.  She must have been brought up in an exceptional way to know all of <br/>\nthis instinctively.  She is VERY COOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thursday, December 6, 2001, at 10:29 PM, Julie Stauffer wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hey Mimi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gotta ask.
