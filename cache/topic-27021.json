The U.S. uses 56 billion gallons of diesel each<br/>\nyear.  It takes 1 barrel of crude to make 10 gallons of diesel.  We imported<br/>\n140 million barrels of crude in 2000.  Not withstanding the other things we<br/>\nget from a barrel of crude, if we changed over to biodiesel, not only would<br/>\nwe come close to stopping our dependence on imported oil, we would reduce<br/>\ndiesel created polutants--sulfur by 100%, soot by 70%, carbon dioxide by<br/>\n100% and nitrogen by 30%.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to do a thing to a diesel engine to use biodiesel.

For example, my<br/>\ngrandfather was a union organizer and Communist.  That meant that all of my<br/>\nfamily on that side was on the Red List (that is what the CIA and Feebs<br/>\ncalled the files they kept) which meant, for example, that my uncle couldn&#39;t<br/>\nget his bar card to practice law.  It also meant that all of us to this day<br/>\nare still on that list.  I happen to have several notation on my<br/>\nfile--Berkeley, Alcatraz, SLA and, horror of horrors, Indian!  And, yes I<br/>\nknow the file is there because I was dating a high level DEA agent back in<br/>\nthe 80s and he was informed that knowing me could be detrimental to his<br/>\ncareer and he was shown the file.  Why, I had the audacity to go to school<br/>\nwith AND go to slumber parties at the home of Nancy Ling Perry who was a<br/>\nreal &quot;evil doer&quot; and became a member of the SLA!  And, naughty, naughty, I<br/>\nraised hell at some protests in Berkeley!<br/>\n<br/>\nI got a call from him a couple of months ago to tell me that all those old<br/>\nfiles were being dusted off because of the SLA trial in LaLa Land.  I can<br/>\njust image what is happening now with those files and the new ones they are<br/>\nopening!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich reminds me, any history buffs out there?

A pact for <br/>\n&gt;&gt;war<br/>\n&gt;&gt;against the TalSE Asia Oil Pipeline, which <br/>\n&gt;&gt;cannot<br/>\n&gt;&gt;take<br/>\n&gt;&gt;place with growing political and religious upheaval in the region at the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;hands<br/>\n&gt;&gt;of the Taliban.  Iran is thought to be a covert member to the pact.  The <br/>\n&gt;&gt;combat<br/>\n&gt;&gt;was initially slated for mid October, which would seem to account for <br/>\n&gt;&gt;warnings<br/>\n&gt;&gt;that preparing for war will take time.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;The problem is that the ONLY logical pipeline route runs for nearly a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;thousand miles along the Afghanistan border with Iran and Pakistan, <br/>\n&gt;&gt;(largely so<br/>\n&gt;&gt;close as to be visible from the border).  This route would seem to provide <br/>\n&gt;&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;US with the bestt serving the same oil<br/>\n&gt;&gt;fields<br/>\n&gt;&gt;in northern Iran and points south, preventing China from obtaining a <br/>\n&gt;&gt;defacto<br/>\n&gt;&gt;monopoly holder on oil supplies for SE Asia.  The Chinese began <br/>\n&gt;&gt;negotiating that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;project in 1997, causing a great deal of consternation for the Clinton<br/>\n&gt;&gt;administration and major US oil companies who stood to gain little in the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;project.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;However, the Taliban are fomenting both religious and political <br/>\n&gt;&gt;instability in<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the region between Iranian and Pakistani Shiites and Taliban Sunni Islamic<br/>\n&gt;&gt;sects, with notable success.  This unrest makes impractical the financial<br/>\n&gt;&gt;investment and international cooperation required to construct the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;pipeline.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;The solution was apparently to be death warrants for both the Taliban <br/>\n&gt;&gt;leader<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Mullah Mohammad Omar, and capitalistic terrorist Osama bin Laden, who had<br/>\n&gt;&gt;apparently grown too profitable and too strong for his former CIA masters <br/>\n&gt;&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;control.  Destruction of the Taliban was imperative, but political needs <br/>\n&gt;&gt;would<br/>\n&gt;&gt;not permit a simple solution.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;For Pakistan and India, long bitter rivals, to partner would require only<br/>\n&gt;&gt;sufficient profits to make peace between them more palatable.  However,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Pakistan required a significant motive beyond profits to risk internal<br/>\n&gt;&gt;conflict due to its nation&#39;s divided religious and political landscape, <br/>\n&gt;&gt;all<br/>\n&gt;&gt;intertwined with allegiances to the Taliban.  There needed to be an <br/>\n&gt;&gt;extremely<br/>\n&gt;&gt;irresistible reason for the nation&#39;s leadership to back/support military <br/>\n&gt;&gt;action<br/>\n&gt;&gt;against what their own citizens considered a virtual spiritual ally.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;In like manner, Iran required an irresistible reason to publicly support <br/>\n&gt;&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;&gt;vocal blessings American interests in any such action, and at the same <br/>\n&gt;&gt;time,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;needed a way to salve bitter wounds between the two countries which would <br/>\n&gt;&gt;allow<br/>\n&gt;&gt;future joint financial ventures.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;In similar manner, the United States needed a very powerful and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;irresistible<br/>\n&gt;&gt;reason to mobilize America into supporting such a war, a war which would <br/>\n&gt;&gt;be<br/>\n&gt;&gt;extremely difficult to prosecute, as the Soviet Union could testify of <br/>\n&gt;&gt;first<br/>\n&gt;&gt;hand, having found the Soviet-Afghanistan war to be their &#39;Vietnam.&#39;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;The logical solution which would indeed provide irresistible reasons for <br/>\n&gt;&gt;all<br/>\n&gt;&gt;concerned, would now seem to be the horrific terror campaign against NYC <br/>\n&gt;&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Washington DC.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Separately, it seems, one of the terrorists was seen by Mossad agents to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;have<br/>\n&gt;&gt;consulted with Iraqi intelligence operatives prior to the attack, a matter<br/>\n&gt;&gt;passed to CIA as a warning that perhaps Iraq and Afghanistan were <br/>\n&gt;&gt;partnering.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  US Intelligence confirms this event but claims it was not because the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;terrorism was sponsored by Iraq, a matter not evident to Mossad, yet CIA<br/>\n&gt;&gt;seems to know.  Indeed, the conference was likely for the personal sale of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;information regarding the truth of the coming attack, which in part <br/>\n&gt;&gt;accounts for<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Iraq&#39;s somewhat evenhanded statements on the disaster, as well as those of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Libya.  Both nations would now seem to be jointly blackmailing US <br/>\n&gt;&gt;intelligence<br/>\n&gt;&gt;for a slice of the action and continued safety -- in exchange for kind <br/>\n&gt;&gt;words and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;a hands-off policy towards the looming military action.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;The attack comes in the wake of revelations by author James Bamford in his <br/>\n&gt;&gt;book<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Body of Evidence of a secret plan for US military intelligence <br/>\n&gt;&gt;cooperatives to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;commit acts of terrorism against American targets... blow up buildings, <br/>\n&gt;&gt;shoot<br/>\n&gt;&gt;down civilian airliners, blow up American war ships, and assassinate <br/>\n&gt;&gt;American<br/>\n&gt;&gt;citizens... for political gain.  Operation Northwoods was signed off by <br/>\n&gt;&gt;all five<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Joint Chiefs of Staff under the Kennedy administration as a way to foment <br/>\n&gt;&gt;public<br/>\n&gt;&gt;support for a war against Cuba, who would be blamed for the terrorist <br/>\n&gt;&gt;acts.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Rejected sternly by President Kennedy, which may have contributed to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;reasons<br/>\n&gt;&gt;behind his assassination, this Reichstag fire approach to political gain <br/>\n&gt;&gt;may<br/>\n&gt;&gt;have been the model for September 11, shifting the blame this time to the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Taliban homeland.  What would make a more irresistible excuse for war?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;In light of these revelations, American media needs to decide if it will<br/>\n&gt;&gt;continue to ignore truth and the principles of journalism for its <br/>\n&gt;&gt;preferred<br/>\n&gt;&gt;role<br/>\n&gt;&gt;as Fourth Estate PR spokesperson of government.  Will they tell America <br/>\n&gt;&gt;these<br/>\n&gt;&gt;facts or hide what the rest of the world already knows through news <br/>\n&gt;&gt;agencies<br/>\n&gt;&gt;which have no such loyalties?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Will American politicians find themselves being asked by their <br/>\n&gt;&gt;constituents if<br/>\n&gt;&gt;they knew in advance of this death pact, and have the blood of innocents <br/>\n&gt;&gt;on<br/>\n&gt;&gt;their hands as coconspirators, or will they demand a full accounting of <br/>\n&gt;&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;facts before signing off on the blood lust boiling over as result of this <br/>\n&gt;&gt;war<br/>\n&gt;&gt;plot?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;For more information, please review the following news sources:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;This article was written by an Indian news agency months before the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;attack:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indiareacts.com/Story33.htm\">http://www.indiareacts.com/Story33.htm</a>&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indiareacts.com/Story33.ht\">http://www.indiareacts.com/Story33.ht</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>m<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;H.
