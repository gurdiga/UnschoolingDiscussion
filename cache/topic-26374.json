My daughter seems to have learned whether I <br/>\n&quot;push&quot; something or even try to &quot;supress&quot; something.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I don&#39;t believe in unsupervised kids, so I subtly tried <br/>\nto discourage my daughter from learning to ride a two wheeler as there <br/>\nis no where for her to ride safely around here.  I was never <br/>\n&quot;available&quot; to help her, dad took a long time revamping the rummage <br/>\nsale bike and it was always stored in an inconvenient part of the <br/>\ngarage.  Well, she learned how to ride anyway BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO.  <br/>\nTurned out to be okay as while she won&#39;t go for exercise walks with <br/>\nme, she will ride her bike while I walk and waits for me at the corner <br/>\nso we can cross streets together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also don&#39;t believe in giving young children allowances.  If my <br/>\ndaughter wanted something, she asks and I buy it for her or it goes on <br/>\nher gift list.  Now she &quot;earns&quot; her own money by turning her brother&#39;s <br/>\nclean socks right side out and pushing the grocery cart for him while <br/>\nI do his shopping (he pays her) and she quickly learned that 2.99 is <br/>\nreally $3 and you always need extra for sales tax and she shops very <br/>\ncarefully with her own money and doesn&#39;t beg for stuff from me, too. I <br/>\nalso don&#39;t find loose coins lying around her room anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the time she was born (it seems) I was anxious for her to read, <br/>\nbut she wasn&#39;t interested.  Then along came Harry Potter when she was <br/>\n8 and I read aloud for hours until I was hoarse.  It was then she <br/>\njumped in and read because I physically could not and we both wanted <br/>\nto find out what happened next!  At nine she now reads as well as if <br/>\nshe HAD started as a new born!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe love our brand of unschooling and have a great relationship.  Hope <br/>\nthis helps,<br/>\n<br/>\nTerese in Milwaukee</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26377,"nextTopicId":26410}}
