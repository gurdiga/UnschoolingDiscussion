The part of the onion you want is that thin tissue-like piece that peels away. Is that making sense? If not I can try to explain it better. You can get iodine and stain it so that you can see it better. If you have any kind of science store, you should be able to get stain cheap.<br/>\n<br/>\nScrapings from the inside of your cheek is a great idea too!  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my favorites was always pond water. There are little organisms that look like miniature copies of bigger animals. I remember one looking like a crab! For pond water you will need a cover slide.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm...I can&#39;t think of anything. You have some good ideas already. Don&#39;t forget that you can use, I think it is the high objective, for oil immersion. Oil immersion allows you to see things even larger than your highest objective- a lot larger. I don&#39;t know the kind of oil that is supposed to be used too. I don&#39;t know if you can substitute any oil around the house, like vegetable oil, or not. If you use oil though make sure you clean the lenses really well with lense paper afterwards.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Olif<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, you can later do two things- add water to your onion cells and observe and then add a salt solution to your onion cell and observe. This demonstrates osmosis. When you add the salt, the cells should shrink. When you add water, they should enlarge. Sometimes they will even burst.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!Get more from the Web.

After we all had thought of everything easy<br/>\nto look at (grass, leaves, feathers, fabric fibers of all kinds, etc.),<br/>\nshe started mixing up spices and other food ingredients to look at. <br/>\nLemon juice does look different when hot than when cold.
