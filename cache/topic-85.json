I&#39;m not sure whether they separate kids<br/>\nby age or not at Hulbert (I know they don&#39;t at Not Back To School Camp --<br/>\nbut Hulbert is more structured I believe).

Take a deep breath!  I think (as a parent)<br/>\nthat it is awful not to be able to reach your child unless you have an<br/>\nemergency!  What if they just need to touch base at home, get support, or<br/>\ntalk a little?  That is probably just my paranoia though, my older son will<br/>\nprobably never go to anything like camp.  He has some very dangerous<br/>\nallergies, and I would not be comfortable with him being so unsupervised<br/>\nand so far from emergency medical care.  I have to carry his medications<br/>\neverywhere he goes, just in case.  It would only take a few seconds after<br/>\nexposure to something (in another child&#39;s candy or something) and we would<br/>\nnot have him anymore, so I am very careful with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the &quot;extra&quot; child in the cabin.  Maybe the parents are having second<br/>\nthoughts about ps.  Maybe the little girl is much more comfortable in the<br/>\nenvironment with the other homeschooled children.  She&#39;s only a little<br/>\ngirl, and in my experience, and extra girl at the slumber party just meant<br/>\nmore giggles to go around.  Trust your daughter&#39;s ability to make the best<br/>\nof the situation.  Her cabin carries the status of having more girls than<br/>\nanyone elses.  That alone should be enough to make the girls in there happy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are this upset, I would call it an emergency (an emotional one<br/>\nanyway.)  Just call the camp and tell them that you need to speak to your<br/>\ndaughter about a personal family matter.  Then ask her what she thinks,<br/>\nfeels about the situation.  It may put your mind at ease, or she may want<br/>\nto come home early if she is really &quot;having an crummy time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"claudia partick","from":"&quot;claudia partick&quot; &lt;pinintree@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"-dV8TVfTxSmLpGNSDeAboKfnxMy2z76HAtmGJuE6ek0dzkaRNud6XbSZKrNclKifi9jqrx7nwbuu1snkGWO-3BGzhlRavKKA7RGe0jmeilIapw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: homeschool camp","postDate":"928335458","msgId":95,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNS45NS45NTkyNjk3MzlAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":85,"nextInTopic":97,"prevInTime":94,"nextInTime":96,"topicId":85,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I can see why you are upset but if it is a well run camp I would think the the schooled child would feel a bit out of place, not your child.

My point is that kids that go to school are not supposed to be at Hulbert during Homeschool Programs.  I understand the desire to visit and hang with friends no matter if you&#39;re in school or not.   There are not alot of forums for *just homeschoolers*.   So, when the opportunity arises for a homeschool specific gathering it is meant as just that.  So, the expectation that kids who are in school should be able to come to such a gathering is ludicrous.  Hulbert breaks the kids cabins into girls and boy and youngest, middle, and oldest children.  It does have a structure to the day but, kids have options of how they choose to participate...it isn&#39;t an option not to participate in some way even if it means just supporting others.  This is all spelled out in the registration materials and so if it isn&#39;t what someone wants there are no surprises.<br/>\nPeace and Understanding<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;::she just is::&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:OmegaMolecule@...\">OmegaMolecule@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Linda,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s okay. I guess I did misunderstand you. I get kind of defensive when<br/>\n&gt; home/unschoolers I know act like kids who go to school are a different<br/>\n&gt; species. I know a lot of very intelligent and perceptive people who go to<br/>\n&gt; school -- and some of them do like hanging around the homeschool crowd!<br/>\n&gt; Their are many homeschoolers are in school for the time being but have<br/>\n&gt; homeschooled friends who they get to see for a whole week at Hulbert.<br/>\n&gt; So how old is your daughter anyway? I&#39;m not sure whether they separate kids<br/>\n&gt; by age or not at Hulbert (I know they don&#39;t at Not Back To School Camp --<br/>\n&gt; but Hulbert is more structured I believe). I&#39;m fifteen and going mainly to<br/>\n&gt; see other homeschooled (and unschooled) teenagers than I made friends with<br/>\n&gt; at an unschoolers weekend. (I&#39;m also going to Not Back To School Camp as<br/>\n&gt; well). Anyway, I&#39;m kind of rambling on right now :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In peace,<br/>\n&gt; Eryn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am not worried about her associating with the right kinds of kids...it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; a place for homeschoolers to gather in community for a week...not for kids<br/>\n&gt; that are having a school experience....we do plenty of that.  When they have<br/>\n&gt; weeks for school kids homeschooler&#39;s are not included....She is involved<br/>\n&gt; with lots of kids here at home...ps kids, private school kids, unschoolers,<br/>\n&gt; whatever...So, yeah it is crummy that kids that aren&#39;t homeschooling are<br/>\n&gt; taking up space.  I never said these children were bad or disruptive...<br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s got lots of schooled friends...she&#39;s social and outgoing and friend<br/>\n&gt; making isn&#39;t a problem for her.

Take a deep breath!  I think (as a parent)<br/>\n&gt; that it is awful not to be able to reach your child unless you have an<br/>\n&gt; emergency!  What if they just need to touch base at home, get support, or<br/>\n&gt; talk a little?  That is probably just my paranoia though, my older son will<br/>\n&gt; probably never go to anything like camp.  He has some very dangerous<br/>\n&gt; allergies, and I would not be comfortable with him being so unsupervised<br/>\n&gt; and so far from emergency medical care.  I have to carry his medications<br/>\n&gt; everywhere he goes, just in case.  It would only take a few seconds after<br/>\n&gt; exposure to something (in another child&#39;s candy or something) and we would<br/>\n&gt; not have him anymore, so I am very careful with him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As to the &quot;extra&quot; child in the cabin.  Maybe the parents are having second<br/>\n&gt; thoughts about ps.  Maybe the little girl is much more comfortable in the<br/>\n&gt; environment with the other homeschooled children.  She&#39;s only a little<br/>\n&gt; girl, and in my experience, and extra girl at the slumber party just meant<br/>\n&gt; more giggles to go around.  Trust your daughter&#39;s ability to make the best<br/>\n&gt; of the situation.  Her cabin carries the status of having more girls than<br/>\n&gt; anyone elses.  That alone should be enough to make the girls in there happy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you are this upset, I would call it an emergency (an emotional one<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; anyway.)  Just call the camp and tell them that you need to speak to your<br/>\n&gt; daughter about a personal family matter.  Then ask her what she thinks,<br/>\n&gt; feels about the situation.  It may put your mind at ease, or she may want<br/>\n&gt; to come home early if she is really &quot;having an crummy time.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps,<br/>\n&gt; Nanci K.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Have you entered ONElist&#39;s &quot;Grow to Give&quot; program?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Deadline is June 19.
