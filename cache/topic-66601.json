Stop reading this list. Honestly, I think it is making you crazy<br/>\nright<br/>\nnow.

Just do it. Unsubscribe! At least for a few days. Just be<br/>\nwith yourself and with your family. Stop worrying about what anyone on<br/>\nthe<br/>\nUnschooling list here thinks. Really! Do it now!<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Remove every single worry or doubt about how your children&#39;s lives<br/>\nwill<br/>\nturn out without you helping them make it so. Release them all. If it<br/>\nhelps,<br/>\nsit down and have a long meditation session and picture yourself<br/>\ndropping<br/>\nthem into a well, or a river, or a garbage dump and running them over<br/>\nwith a<br/>\nbulldozer. Or write them all on paper and crumple each one and burn it,<br/>\nor<br/>\nthrow it into the trash. Examine every single one and drop it. Do so<br/>\nconsciously. Now go out and make it so. You are hereby released from<br/>\ntaking<br/>\nthe responsibility for your children&#39;s future happiness. Live right<br/>\nhere,<br/>\nright now, in today. Help them accomplish whatever makes them happy<br/>\ntoday,<br/>\nwhether that does or does not add up to some future goal or plan. Go to<br/>\na<br/>\npark, have a picnic, sit and snuggle and watch a movie, or let them do<br/>\nwhatever it is they want to do. Just release them from the pressure of<br/>\nyour<br/>\nwants, wishes, desires, and goals. Let them build their own.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Sit down and make a goal of your own desires, wishes, goals FOR<br/>\nYOURSELF.<br/>\nFind one of them and start working towards it, today! Want to learn to<br/>\nknit<br/>\nan afgan? TODAY, go out and find a beginning knitting class, or just buy<br/>\na<br/>\nknitting book or just some needles and yarn. Want to run a marathon?<br/>\nTODAY,<br/>\ngo out and get some running shoes. Want to read all the classics? Go<br/>\ncheck<br/>\nJane Eyre out of the library TODAY. Just do it. Start building your own<br/>\nlife. Not your world that has been about your children for twenty-three<br/>\nyears. Your OWN wants, needs, desires. Just do it. Now. The only way to<br/>\nstop<br/>\nmeddling in your children&#39;s futures is to build your own. Start today.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s it. Really, that&#39;s all there is to it. Come back to this list<br/>\nwhen<br/>\nyou truly feel it will not unbalance your life. I&#39;m not saying this to<br/>\nbe<br/>\ncruel. This is a high-volume, high-intensity list. I&#39;ve been subscribed<br/>\nto<br/>\nit on and off for years. There have been times I&#39;ve taken a break of a<br/>\nweek,<br/>\na month, or a year when it has been necessary for the balance in my<br/>\nlife.<br/>\nThe trick is to know when the list is helping you and when it is<br/>\nconsuming<br/>\nyou. I suspect deeply that right now this list is not helping you. So<br/>\nditch<br/>\nit. Follow the three steps above, and you&#39;ll begin to see the paradigm<br/>\nshift<br/>\nthat is necessary to unschool. You really have to release all of that<br/>\nand<br/>\nbuild your own life to see it. You cannot see it when you are trapped in<br/>\nan<br/>\nexistence of trying to control your kid&#39;s lives and futures.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck to you, really.
