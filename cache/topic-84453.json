How long were classes?  How long was recess?  What is it like<br/>\n<br/>\nriding the bus?  Then one of them said that he would like to try school for<br/>\n<br/>\na week to see what it was like.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly and I just went through that.  She said she&#39;d like to go next year, at <br/>\nleast for a while, &quot;just for the experience.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week I drove her slowly by two schools while kids were outside.  One was <br/>\na Catholic mid-school.  We actually turned and parked until they all went in <br/>\nafter lunch.  We discussed the uniforms and the lining up and the reality that <br/>\nnot all the kids were having fun out there, some were alone or afraid to go <br/>\nback in or wishing they could be at home.  I wasn&#39;t pushing anti-school stuff, <br/>\njust sharing observations with her.   Then on the way to the post office, kids <br/>\nwere out at a public elementary.  I went the longest way around so we she <br/>\ncould check them out.  I said &quot;being on the playground is a very small part of <br/>\ntheir day,&quot; and she said impatiently, &quot;I know.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said she might ask her friend (a neighbor two blocks up) to show her her <br/>\nbooks and homework sometime and that might help satisfy her urge.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told Holly I would hate it if the other kids were mean to her because she <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t write as fast as they could or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night my husband and I were out driving kidlessly and I talked to him <br/>\nabout that.  He said she probably wouldn&#39;t last long, and I said maybe long <br/>\nenough for them to make her think she wasn&#39;t too bright.  But we convinced <br/>\nourselves that it wouldn&#39;t take her long to figure out the few things she wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand (like where to put her name on the paper, and looking at other kids&#39; <br/>\nwork could get her in trouble; or math notation).  He figured she&#39;d only need <br/>\nto be reminded that she would have three hours straight of not getting to eat <br/>\nor walk around, and she&#39;d be hapy to stay home.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis one concern was that she&#39;s never been registered, and if she goes to <br/>\nschool they might care.  I wasn&#39;t worried.  I said if she decided to quit I could <br/>\njust give them a filled-out copy of a state registration form and they&#39;d be <br/>\nhappy.  (That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;d have to mail the original to the state.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re open to her trying it.  I hope she changes her mind, but if she gets to <br/>\nbe 17 and never tried it, she might really wish she had.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If they want to go to school, am I failing as an unschooling mom?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably not.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Are they not challenged? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n?

Maybe go to some <br/>\nschool-field-trip places and follow along near a school group.  That might cure them <br/>\nsome too!  That group probably will be goofing off, being told to be quiet and <br/>\nlisten, totally missing the zoo/museum/play for the most part out of the joy of <br/>\nbeing with the other kids outside the classroom.
