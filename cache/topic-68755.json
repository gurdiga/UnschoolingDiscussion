I just can t ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-279407894\">Hi all<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery year I get very frustrated with Mothers&#39; Day. I stay away from the<br/>\nshops unless necessary and throw away the junk mail unopened. I just can&#39;t<br/>\nstand the message which is pushed at us of &quot;Buy, Buy, Buy or feel GUILTY&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Buy Mum a Microwave&quot;, &quot;Take Mum out to lunch&quot;, &quot;Have you got Mum&#39;s<br/>\nchocolates and flowers yet?&#39;&#39;....and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe in any of this. I wonder where Mothers&#39; Day came from<br/>\nanyway. Who says we have to have a special day to appreciate our Mum, why<br/>\nnot just any old day? The big winner here is of course the shops. I feel<br/>\nlike a heretic if I mention this to anyone. My neighbour left the jeweller&#39;s<br/>\ncatalogue on her bench with the dinner set she wanted circled clearly so<br/>\nthat her husband and children would make the right choice!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trouble is, my Mum believes all this in a big way. So I dutifully go<br/>\nshopping and wander around in circles, confused and vaguely cross about the<br/>\nwhole thing. What can I buy for my retired affluent mother that she can&#39;t<br/>\nbuy for herself? She spends loads of money on flashy-flunky stuff that I<br/>\ncan&#39;t see the point of. I end up buying something, just a token something so<br/>\nthat she won&#39;t feel entirely neglected.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor myself, I tell my children not to ever feel that pressure to buy. I know<br/>\nthat when I am sixty, if not one of my children rang me or visited on<br/>\nMothers&#39; Day I would feel hurt, but I never want them wandering around in<br/>\ncircles &quot;having&quot; to buy something for their Mum.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo on Mothers&#39; Day here, the boys came in with their home-made cards - all<br/>\nvery individual and precious. No present, because that&#39;s the way I want it.<br/>\nMothers&#39; Day at house is over in a half-hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then for the rest of the day, I had this kind of let-down feeling. I<br/>\nguess I have been conditioned to expect the TV dream of children bouncing<br/>\ninto the room with large beribboned gifts and proceeding to all laugh and<br/>\ntoss their heads as though they are in advertisements for hair commercials.<br/>\nThat isn&#39;t real and I know it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else out there know what I am talking about?<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n-----&gt; It was about Mother&#39;s Day.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It was about, on my end, how Mother&#39;s Day is at my house, and on his end,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>how<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it is all screwed up at his house.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the hope of making sure it was a big deal, he reminded his stepsons two<br/>\n&gt; months ago.
