I have not &quot;blamed&quot; anyone.  Nor have I called anyone a &quot;bad<br/>\nparent&quot;.  Those terms are coming from people who seem to think that holding<br/>\nan unpopular opinion is judgemental.  That aside, I think I know what you<br/>\nmean.  Maybe.  My position is:  Parenting is the most important job in the<br/>\nworld.  There is nothing that I will do that will have such lasting impact<br/>\non the world in which I live.  Because it is such an important job, it<br/>\nshould not be left to others to do for me.  Someone else is capable of<br/>\nanswering phones, running a store, or writing reports.  There is *NO OTHER<br/>\nPERSON* on this earth who is as capable of raising my children as I (and my<br/>\nhsband) am.  Still with me?  Okay, given those beliefs I then must say that<br/>\nleaving the most important job (raising my children) to someone else so that<br/>\nI can go do another job is a wrong choice.  How can you see it any other<br/>\nway?  It is very easy to see it another way if you believe that parenting is<br/>\na no-brainer that any one could do, but I don&#39;t see it that way.  Parenting,<br/>\nespecially mothering, has become such a lowly postion that it is no wonder<br/>\nthat so many mothers have left their primary job for something that is more<br/>\nhighly regarded!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not said that women should never work, I am saying that women need to<br/>\nmake a choice between working or raising their children.  They can both be<br/>\ndone, just not at the same time.  Perhaps a woman wants to work first and<br/>\nthen have children, or maybe she chooses to have children first and work<br/>\nafter they are grown.  But one must choose which to do first, because when<br/>\nthey are done simultaneously then the children are the ones to suffer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   second water-We live in an area where the water is very nasty-it tastes<br/>\n&gt; bad and it is polluted if you&#39;re ok with your children drinking it fine, I<br/>\n&gt; am not.
