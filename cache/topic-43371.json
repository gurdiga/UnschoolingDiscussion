There ARE things that run counter to unschooling.  Nobody has<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;the only right way, but there ARE wrong ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Totally agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And when someone doesn&#39;t ask for advice, it&#39;s not fair for someone to give<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;it or make rude comments about it or attack it.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What was the thing nobody asked about?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well in the past few days, there have been quite a few things said just as <br/>\nin &quot;this is what I do&quot; that some people have had a field day with. If <br/>\nsomeone says that they don&#39;t allow certain programs to be watched by their <br/>\nkids, then if anyone has a problem with that, I would think the reasonable <br/>\nthing to do is ask &quot;Why?&quot; not tell them that they are wrong. When I say I <br/>\nwon&#39;t let my baby eat a whole bag of MM&#39;s when we&#39;re talking about saying <br/>\nno, I don&#39;t expect to have to go through the whole diarrhea thing to justify <br/>\nmyself because someone tells me I don&#39;t &quot;know&quot; what I&#39;m really saying. A <br/>\nsimple &quot;have you let her do that&quot; would have solved the whole thing in one <br/>\npost. Those are just two examples.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;For people who are suppose to be so aware of treating everyone <br/>\nequally...&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t understand what is intended by this.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Meaning that from how you all sound so respectful of your children&#39;s <br/>\nfeelings and thoughts, some seem not so courteous when it comes to some <br/>\npeople on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;We can discuss 18 things at once here.  You don&#39;t have to wait for one <br/>\n&gt;topic<br/>\n&gt;to settle to start another one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well I know I posted about a problem I would have loved to have any answer <br/>\nto at all and got none. I also saw another woman post about having time <br/>\nenough for each child and as far as I saw, I was the only one that responded <br/>\nto that one too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the world�s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"hsmominoz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] whose business is what","postDate":"1031576615","msgId":43410,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5Yi44NGU3OWFmLjJhYWRmNjI3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43403,"nextInTopic":43425,"prevInTime":43409,"nextInTime":43411,"topicId":43371,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/9/02 12:39:43 AM Central Daylight Time, ...

We are all homeschooling, and unschooling is <br/>\nhomeschooling, but that doesn&#39;t mean that all homeschooling is unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And when someone <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t ask for advice, it&#39;s not fair for someone to give it or make rude <br/>\n&gt;comments about it or attack it.

The main reason <br/>\nsomeone posts here is for discussion. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If someone else thinks there is a better <br/>\n&gt;way for someone to approach something when they haven&#39;t asked for help, <br/>\n&gt;there&#39;s just more courteous ways of asking instead of showing them how wrong <br/>\n&gt;they are. There&#39;s been a lot of that going on here. For people who are <br/>\n&gt;suppose to be so aware of treating everyone equally, I see just the opposite <br/>\n&gt;here at times.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been very careful to say &quot;in my family&quot; or &quot;what works for us&quot; and <br/>\n&gt;&quot;some people&quot; and &quot;some of what I see&quot; etc. so I don&#39;t step on toes just out <br/>\n&gt;of respect. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From now on, just read the *implied* &quot;in my family&quot; or &quot;what works for us&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;some people&quot; and &quot;some of what I see&quot; etc. It is what we all mean, but <br/>\ndon&#39;t write. Its kinda like the implied &quot;you&quot; in English class. I remember <br/>\ndoing countless drills with sentences pointing out the implied &quot;you.&quot; (Go to <br/>\nthe store. &quot;implied you&quot; Please bring me that toilet-paper. &quot;implied you&quot; ) <br/>\nIt isn&#39;t stepping on toes or being rude. It isn&#39;t disrespectful. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Others here have not done that and I don&#39;t think, in very simple <br/>\n&gt;terms that it&#39;s nice.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know what to say to this, except for, unless you have been here for a <br/>\nwhile and know others posting styles, it isn&#39;t nice to dissect peoples <br/>\nposting styles. Some here don&#39;t use their spell checker. I can&#39;t stand that. <br/>\nBut you don&#39;t see me raging around saying &quot;that&#39;s not nice&quot; or &quot;no fair&quot; I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t do that, cause I misspell tons, and would hate to have someone point <br/>\nout my spelling mistakes that I didn&#39;t catch. Or to turn it around, I have <br/>\nhorrible grammatical skills. You wouldn&#39;t know it to hear me speak, I do that <br/>\nvery well. But to read what I write, you might think I am some illiterate <br/>\nbumpkin. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And I know many read, I just think more would post if they weren&#39;t afraid of <br/>\n&gt;being put on trial. We all need to have discussions to question why we do <br/>\n&gt;what we do, it helps us all to evaluate what we do and maybe change it also. <br/>\n&gt;But pointing fingers as soon as someone makes a comment that others don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;like is silly. Can&#39;t one just ask without making the person feel like <br/>\n&gt;Hitler?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, most don&#39;t post because of time constraints, or family or whatever else. <br/>\nMost are on *no mail* and read posts at random. Many do post, when the topics <br/>\nroll around to something they are interested in. And on that vein, the topics <br/>\ndo roll around. &lt;g&gt; Much like this topic of finger pointing, we discuss this <br/>\none about once every 4 to 6 weeks or so. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And this whole bedtime/porno/cursing post has got everyone so worked up, I <br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t get an honest answer to a problem I was hoping for some solutions to. <br/>\n&gt;Kama Sutra has taken priority.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Mary B<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We can talk about more than one thing here.

When I dropped her off at <br/>\n6:57 I said &quot;Call when you want a ride!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said, &quot;I&#39;ll try to call before 10:00 this time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI said, &quot;Okay, but if it&#39;s after 10:00 I&#39;ll come and get you anyway.

Lots of families are doing the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome families volunteer at church, or with scouts, or political parties, or <br/>\nwhatever.
