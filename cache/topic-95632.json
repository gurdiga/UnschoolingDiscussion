And he spent a few miniutes spiking his hair. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy stepmom made a snarky comment to him about his clothes and how maybe I should pick them for him. He looked at her and very sweetly told her that he was almost 6 and was prefectly capeable of picking out his own clothes and that if she couldn&#39;t say anything nice to him about his clothes than she didn&#39;t need to say anything at all. (the say something nice or nothing at all is a point she&#39;s been trying to make with him)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe wasn&#39;t as amused as Jason and I were. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAvery(3 next month) has been known to wear a button down shirt to dinner at grandparents house, but it&#39;s frequently all he has on. He hates to wear clothes and will strip down as soon as he can.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Rebecca<br/>\n--<br/>\nYou know, Hobbes, some days even my lucky rocketship underpants don&#39;t help.&quot;<br/>\n-Calvin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;At our Friday family dinner he wears a<br/>\nbutton-down short sleeved shirt (he prefers those to tees), because he knows<br/>\nit pleases his Dad and all the grandparents.&gt;&gt;&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95428,"nextTopicId":95615}}
