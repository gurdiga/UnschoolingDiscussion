Maybe 1-2% of women. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t discount those who physically can not.   I am amongst them, and it can <br/>\nbe a very difficult, traumatic thing.  I suffer from post traumatic stress <br/>\ndisorder because of the events leading me to be unable to breastfeed this <br/>\nchild.  It resulted in my clinical death.  I relive the horror almost nightly <br/>\nin nightmares.  You can&#39;t imagine how painful it is to be sneered at and <br/>\nattacked because of it.   I don&#39;t think I have ever met a more cruel, <br/>\nexclusive group than dogmatic breastfeeders.  <br/>\nBy the way, it doesn&#39;t really matter how many women are physically unable to <br/>\nbreastfeed.  If you (generic you, not any one in particular) can, then that&#39;s <br/>\nall you need to be concerned about.  Great! ! More power to ya, mazeltov, and <br/>\nhere&#39;s a big attagirl.  And if you can&#39;t, and your baby is happy and healthy <br/>\non formula then Great!  More power to ya, mazeltov, and a big attagirl to you <br/>\ntoo.  Both of you are great moms.  Frankly, I don&#39;t need to know how you feed <br/>\nyour baby.  I&#39;ve got plenty of my own business to be concerned about.  <br/>\n<br/>\n*** KiM ***<br/>\nruns with scissors</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7458,"nextTopicId":7983}}
