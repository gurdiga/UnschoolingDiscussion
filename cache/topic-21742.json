No<br/>\nevident &quot;sounding out&quot; of words, but she could somehow read words I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave thought she&#39;d had opportunity to sight-learn.  She read with expression<br/>\neven then.  She&#39;s just wired for language somehow.  It came quite naturally<br/>\nto her.  I did read to her a lot, we watched Sesame Street together, made up<br/>\nword games because that&#39;s what she liked.  No teaching.  She just read.  Has<br/>\nnever *had* phonics.  She&#39;s also writing a lot now, at 11.  Her spelling is<br/>\npretty good and I think she usually realizes on her own when she makes<br/>\nspelling errors.  Not sure though, because she doesn&#39;t show me much of what<br/>\nshe writes.  I have no idea what&#39;s in all of those journals.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy middle daughter *said* she couldn&#39;t read up until this year, and she&#39;s 8.<br/>\nShe actually could read a few words, but I she didn&#39;t really get that what<br/>\nshe&#39;s doing is reading until this year.  That realization came to her while<br/>\nplaying Gameboy--pokemon, I think.  She suddenly got that she knew what the<br/>\nwords on the screen were.  Very cool moment.  We haven&#39;t &quot;done&quot; phonics<br/>\neither, though I offered several times when I realized she wanted to learn<br/>\nto read.  She did read some Bob books to me last year--I just this moment<br/>\nremembered that, and she thought that was cool too, but she knew those were<br/>\nwords that were chosen to be really easy, and it didn&#39;t mean the same thing<br/>\nto her that reading the Gameboy screen did, where she was reading for<br/>\ninformation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son, who just turned 5 isn&#39;t reading at all, and in fact there are a few<br/>\nletters he still confuses.  He can spell &quot;aardvark,&quot; though, picked up from<br/>\nwatching Arthur on PBS.  ;-)  He likes to ask me to spell things and tells<br/>\nme, &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;incorrect.&quot;  He likes Mr. Ratburn, obviously.  A few weeks<br/>\nago, my PS&#39;ed 10 year old nephew got into an argument with him, insisting<br/>\nthat &quot;a-a-r-d-v-a-r-k&quot; was incorrect.  &lt;g&gt;.  Charlie&#39;s sisters backed him<br/>\nup, and the cousin still didn&#39;t believe them until his mom said,  &quot;Yes, a<br/>\nword can start with AA and aardvark does.  :-D  If Charlie reads late, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think I&#39;ll freak out or anything because I&#39;ve already watched one<br/>\nchild who swore she couldn&#39;t read and was at the beginning of some real<br/>\nfrustration about it--and who adamantly did not want lessons--simply pick up<br/>\nthe skills when she was ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I could explain the mechanics of my children learning to read, I would,<br/>\nbut for us, it&#39;s been internal process I haven&#39;t really been privy to.  We<br/>\nhave tons of books, tv, video games, and I read to them (less for every<br/>\nchild, though--less time on my part, less interest on their parts--the<br/>\nyounger ones were more interested in keeping up with the other kids than<br/>\nsitting still with me) and they see me reading for information and pleasure<br/>\nand writing a great deal.  That&#39;s about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry I can&#39;t shed more light about specifics.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21789,"nextTopicId":21791}}
