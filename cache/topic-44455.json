Nesbitt books (because Edward Eager <br/>\nmentions them in his books) and then PBS showed the WONDERFUL movie of &quot;The <br/>\nRailway Children&quot; -- it was lovely.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter was in school until 4th grade. Yet ANOTHER reason I <br/>\nstarted giving up on school was that her teacher couldn&#39;t get permission to <br/>\nhave &quot;Half Magic&quot; be used in their supposedly &quot;Literature-Based Mathematics&quot; <br/>\nprogram. Half-Magic was not on the approved literature list for the State of <br/>\nCalifornia -- so she applied to have it added and it was turned down. The <br/>\nonly explanation was that it was &quot;too old and outdated.&quot; She and I were both <br/>\ndisgusted -- what kind of reason is THAT? Are they going to use that reason <br/>\nfor eliminating all the great literature of the past?
