She still keeps in touch with her friends. I think I had a harder<br/>\ntime with it than she did. I am a very loyal person and still feel a sense<br/>\nof loss from not being at her school. However, we are thoroghly enjoying our<br/>\nunschooling experience and I don&#39;t regret our choice. It&#39;s also important to<br/>\nremember thar a)it&#39;s not carved in stone and b) there are plenty of families<br/>\nthat homeschool some of their kids and send some to school. So whatever<br/>\nchoice you make can be flexible enough to fit your family&#39;s needs. Good Luck<br/>\nto all of you in your quest for the ultimate homeschool life.<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Nicoletta Manns &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snmanns@...\">snmanns@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, May 27, 2000 5:05 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] SWITCHING TO UNSCHOOLING<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello everyone,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; my name is Nicoletta and my husband, Fran, and I have four children<br/>\n&gt; together: three girls currently in public school, ages 13, 11 and 10,<br/>\n&gt; and a son aged 3.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the last year or so I have been getting in touch with more and<br/>\n&gt; more people interested in de-/un-/home- and alternative schooling and<br/>\n&gt; what I am learning resonates very strongly with me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Our girls are somewhat interested in the subject, their main concern<br/>\n&gt; seems to be losing touch with all their friends.
