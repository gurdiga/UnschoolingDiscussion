My research, so far, shows a growing<br/>\ninterest by public librarians in providing resources for this particular<br/>\ngroup of parents and children.  On the other hand, the Internet and books<br/>\nwith lists of resources for homeschools seldom, if ever, mention using the<br/>\npublic library.  So, for my project, I thought I would see 1) what resources<br/>\nthe public libraries provide; 2) who uses those resources and how often; and<br/>\n3) what resources the parent/teacher and children need/want.  I suppose I<br/>\ncould ask the libraries, but I thought the real answers would/should come<br/>\nfrom the homeschoolers themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n    Please send the attached questionnaire to any homeschoolers you are able<br/>\nto reach and ask that they send the reply to me at:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maryann-w@...\">maryann-w@...</a>.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n    MaryAnn Wingenbach<br/>\n<br/>\n    Library and Information Science student<br/>\n<br/>\n    University of Pittsburgh      <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55867,"nextTopicId":55958}}
