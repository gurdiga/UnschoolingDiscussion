He<br/>\n&gt; believes shyness is a positive naturally occurring quality in children<br/>\n&gt; which is instinctive and promotes attachment of children to their<br/>\n&gt; parents.  He recognizes that there are large variances of shyness but<br/>\n&gt; he sees it as an important force for focusing children on the people<br/>\n&gt; who care about them.  It is not a problem per se.  Very shy children<br/>\n&gt; have high attachment needs which need to be met.  I have stopped<br/>\n&gt; (mostly) &quot;encouraging&quot; my children to be &quot;independent&quot;.  You can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; stop independence when they are ready for it which occurs much later<br/>\n&gt; than most people think.  Late adolescence is the time for the natural<br/>\n&gt; emergence of true independence.  Independence is forced on children<br/>\n&gt; entirely too early which results not in independence but &quot;peer<br/>\n&gt; identified&quot; children with displaced dependence on their peers who are<br/>\n&gt; ill equipped to meet their real needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>when i was growing up i would have glued myself to my mom if i could<br/>\nhave and was more attached to her that any of my 4 siblings but moved<br/>\naway from home at 17 and have only been back for visits and a few months<br/>\nduring my 20&#39;s.  not so for my siblings (one is still living there and<br/>\nthe other have lived there at least 3 yrs)  i&#39;m by far the most<br/>\nindependent and rarely went out during my teen years - i just was<br/>\ninterested in it.  so this is to say i completely agree with this<br/>\nstatement.  the negative view of loners really annoys me i just don&#39;t<br/>\nenjoy being so stimulated all the time just once in awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was subscribed to this list many months ago but unsubscribed because<br/>\n&gt; my family needed my time more than I needed this list.  I really like<br/>\n&gt; it but I can see that I will need to unsubcribe again.  I just can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; master the delete key in the way I need to.   The topics are too<br/>\n&gt; interesting and I agree and disagree with people so intensely.
