I&#39;ve been away almost a year, now, due to pregnancy complications <br/>\nand the business of a new baby after 5 years... I just wanted to drop a line and <br/>\nTHANK everyone for the advice I received on preparing my then 5 year old for <br/>\na new sibling. I was all set to tell him all the points, good and bad that <br/>\nmight come up, but got quite a few comments here that said to let him figure most <br/>\nof it out on his own, instead of giving him pre-conceived ideas or making him <br/>\naware of things that might never come to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur baby boy, Storm, was born October 28th, and after a couple months of <br/>\ndistance (both physical and emotional), our oldest, Wyl, finally started to warm <br/>\nto the baby. I tell you, I don&#39;t think I have ever done anything harder than to <br/>\nrestrain myself when all I wanted to say were things like, &quot;Oh, just hold him <br/>\nfor a moment!&quot;, &quot;You can give him a bottle, just sit down and try.&quot;, &quot;Oh, <br/>\ncome play with him, smile at him and jiggle this toy....&quot; With each passing day <br/>\nit got harder to keep my mouth shut, but I kept thinking of the advice I had <br/>\ngotten here and bit my tongue... And your advice REALLY paid off! After 9 1/2 <br/>\nmonths, he has FAR exceeded any expectations I could have ever dreamed up in the <br/>\nbrother department!! He loves his brother SO MUCH! Well, they both adore each <br/>\nother! He is so helpful, loving, sweet-loves to play with him and make him <br/>\nlaugh, and I&#39;ve never seen a HINT of resentment or jelousy! Thank you all SO <br/>\nMUCH for the advice-things would NOT be the same in our family without it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nSang<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150279669,"authorName":"emma bovary","from":"emma bovary &lt;e_bovary@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Thanks for the advice!","postDate":"1091495144","msgId":97218,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwODAzMDEwNTQ0LjUxMjc2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwNDEwLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":107747,"prevInTime":97217,"nextInTime":97219,"topicId":97218,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi!

I am new to homeschooling and unschooling.  One of the things that appealed to me about unschooling was the fact that I can view my children as people not as robots.  My son is also the type that does things when he is good and ready to do them.  I just accept it as one of his traits.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks again to everyone who gave me some advice.
