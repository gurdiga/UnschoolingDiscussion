At least not in my house. My youngest (and my only boy, for<br/>\n&gt; whatever that&#39;s worth) has had serious anger management issues his whole<br/>\n&gt; 3.5 years. ;) Yes, 3.5 is not that old, and yes, anger and frustration<br/>\ncome<br/>\n&gt; with the territory, absolutely.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But, having always practiced attachment parenting with him and his two<br/>\n&gt; older siblings (all my kids are 17 months apart), and always having had a<br/>\n&gt; very loving atmosphere in our home, Sam&#39;s behavior can be way over the<br/>\ntop.<br/>\n&gt; He will hit, yell, hurl things, bang things, you name it. My mother in law<br/>\n&gt; tried giving him one of those blow-up punching bag things, as if I hadn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; tried to show him appropriate outlets for his behavior. Well, that did<br/>\n&gt; nothing for him whatsoever. One minute he would be my sweet little boy,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; the next he&#39;d be enraged. There was nothing predictable in what would set<br/>\n&gt; him off; he was not exposed to any behavior of this sort. He would<br/>\n&gt; literally run across an entire room just to hit someone instead of just<br/>\n&gt; pitching his fit where he was. It was as if he just HAD to hit someone. As<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s gotten a bit older, some of this rage has become more verbal, kind of<br/>\n&gt; like you&#39;re describing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; About a year ago, I started to bring up his extreme behavior to my<br/>\n&gt; pediatrician, who pretty much told me that I had two wonderful children,<br/>\n&gt; and now I was just dealing with a high-need child who was also a boy. Boys<br/>\n&gt; will be boys--maybe, but that&#39;s no excuse for throwing blocks at your<br/>\n&gt; sister&#39;s head or kicking your mother.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I totally agree that birth order can play a big part in this. My Sam&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; the oldest but the youngest, and I&#39;m sure this is difficult for him.<br/>\n&gt; Frustration is high because he wants to be able to do everything his<br/>\n&gt; sisters do. In many ways he can, but in lots of ways he can&#39;t. Still, this<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t provide the answers to my puzzle.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am seriously looking into the possibility of food allergies/<br/>\n&gt; sensitivities. Sam has many classic signs, even if my pediatrician doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; buy the link between behavior and food allergies--red-rimmed ears, red<br/>\n&gt; sand-paper cheeks, nail biting, chewing on sleeves and the corners of his<br/>\n&gt; blanket.

Maybe because he learned <br/>\nso long ago that he COULD control his mood.  Maybe because of his years of <br/>\nkarate.  Maybe he just &#39;grew out of it.&#39;  Probably some of all of that.   <br/>\nLargely, we have worked to make his life comfortable and sensible and safe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":131271049,"authorName":"Susan Gallien","from":"&quot;Susan Gallien&quot; &lt;susan@...&gt;","profile":"susanmarguerite","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] I hate you!!","postDate":"1072232237","msgId":86737,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZWUwMWMzYzljNCQwZjYwYTFmMCQ4MGU5YjI0MUBTVUU+","referencesHeader":"PGJzYThsMCtkdW5xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":86735,"nextInTopic":86739,"prevInTime":86736,"nextInTime":86738,"topicId":86696,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When one of mine said that I said to her something along the line of:  I m sure that you don t hate me... you just hate just something that I did.

You sound fed up and a little angry with him, maybe he feels the same way about something.  His feelings are as real as yours.  There is something wrong, something he feels very strongly about, but maybe doesn&#39;t know how to express what he&#39;s feeling, so he lashes out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent things upset different people, and trying to understand his feelings will help more than trying to get him to suppress his feelings.

We put most of them out on <br/>\nChristmas Eve after the kids are asleep, but there are some there <br/>\njust for fun. Joel decided it would be fun to separate his brother&#39;s <br/>\ngifts from his own, and went about creating two piles. Fine. His <br/>\nbrother, who had carefully picked out a gift for his dad, and then <br/>\nwrapped it and put it under the tree, wanted to put that gift in his <br/>\nown pile. But Joel was deadset against it. I told him if his brother <br/>\nwanted it in his pile, that was okay. It is a gift from him to his <br/>\ndad and he can put it where he wants. But Joel was adamant, and so <br/>\nupset, he picked up the present and threw it at the wall. At which <br/>\npoint, I sent him to his bed. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s something wrong. He needs MORE attention, not less.

If mom learns to trust her natural nurturing instincts <br/>\nand that they are *good* and that she is a good mom and a good <br/>\nperson, she will walk in that! I&#39;m surprised and dismayed at how <br/>\nmany times people will insinuate that something she thinks or does <br/>\nis wrong... when it is usually just a different opinion about <br/>\napproach. This is so prevalent and, I think, the reason so many moms <br/>\nend up feeling isolated. Because if she asks for help, surely <br/>\nsomeone is going to say, &quot;You&#39;re doing everything wrong&quot; which isn&#39;t <br/>\na far cry from &quot;you&#39;re a bad mom.&quot; And if mom has any insecurities <br/>\nabout that, then this can lead to more isolation. <br/>\n<br/>\nCarly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":127152010,"authorName":"Holly Furgason","from":"&quot;Holly Furgason&quot; &lt;unschooler@...&gt;","profile":"hollyfurgason","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: I hate you!!","postDate":"1072229845","msgId":86723,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJzYXFrbCtoZjdhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJzYWxwZis5azVzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":86722,"nextInTopic":86724,"prevInTime":86722,"nextInTime":86724,"topicId":86696,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"All of my kids at one time or another have told us or their sibs that they hate them.

At least not in my house. My youngest (and my only boy, for <br/>\nwhatever that&#39;s worth) has had serious anger management issues his whole <br/>\n3.5 years. ;) Yes, 3.5 is not that old, and yes, anger and frustration come <br/>\nwith the territory, absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, having always practiced attachment parenting with him and his two <br/>\nolder siblings (all my kids are 17 months apart), and always having had a <br/>\nvery loving atmosphere in our home, Sam&#39;s behavior can be way over the top. <br/>\nHe will hit, yell, hurl things, bang things, you name it. My mother in law <br/>\ntried giving him one of those blow-up punching bag things, as if I hadn&#39;t <br/>\ntried to show him appropriate outlets for his behavior. Well, that did <br/>\nnothing for him whatsoever. One minute he would be my sweet little boy, and <br/>\nthe next he&#39;d be enraged. There was nothing predictable in what would set <br/>\nhim off; he was not exposed to any behavior of this sort. He would <br/>\nliterally run across an entire room just to hit someone instead of just <br/>\npitching his fit where he was. It was as if he just HAD to hit someone. As <br/>\nhe&#39;s gotten a bit older, some of this rage has become more verbal, kind of <br/>\nlike you&#39;re describing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout a year ago, I started to bring up his extreme behavior to my <br/>\npediatrician, who pretty much told me that I had two wonderful children, <br/>\nand now I was just dealing with a high-need child who was also a boy. Boys <br/>\nwill be boys--maybe, but that&#39;s no excuse for throwing blocks at your <br/>\nsister&#39;s head or kicking your mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree that birth order can play a big part in this. My Sam&#39;s not <br/>\nthe oldest but the youngest, and I&#39;m sure this is difficult for him. <br/>\nFrustration is high because he wants to be able to do everything his <br/>\nsisters do. In many ways he can, but in lots of ways he can&#39;t. Still, this <br/>\ndidn&#39;t provide the answers to my puzzle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am seriously looking into the possibility of food allergies/ <br/>\nsensitivities. Sam has many classic signs, even if my pediatrician doesn&#39;t <br/>\nbuy the link between behavior and food allergies--red-rimmed ears, red <br/>\nsand-paper cheeks, nail biting, chewing on sleeves and the corners of his <br/>\nblanket.  We&#39;ve only been working on this for about two weeks, but already <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen some really positive responses in him. He&#39;s much easier to <br/>\ncomfort. He regains control far more quickly. He&#39;s less likely to lose <br/>\ncontrol in the first place. When he would throw tantrums, it was like he <br/>\nwas inside a monster, looking out and having no control over what he was <br/>\ndoing or saying. There was fear in his eyes, and it was heartbreaking. I&#39;ve <br/>\nspoken to adults with food allergies, and they&#39;ve described it in precisely <br/>\nthese terms, saying things like, &quot;It&#39;s like trying to climb out of your own <br/>\nskin.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI started by listening to some well-meaning friends who&#39;ve dealt with <br/>\nsimilar issues.

I think you&#39;re right. I have said the same things you <br/>\nmentioned, and often, just as you said, he will a few minutes (or <br/>\nhours) come back and cuddle in my lap and say, &quot;I love you, mom!&quot; <br/>\nOnce he wrote his dad a note that said, &quot;I&#39;m vry mad at you but I <br/>\nstill love you.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nStill, the level of his anger and fury are off the map, and just <br/>\nunacceptable, in my mind. In fact, after I wrote this, he screamed <br/>\nat me, &quot;I&#39;m going to kill you!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI DON&#39;T know where he gets this. I have never, never, never told him <br/>\nI hate him, or that I will kill him, or threatened bodily or <br/>\nphysical harm. Neither has his dad or brother. There have been a few <br/>\ntimes in his life when I have (and I&#39;m ashamed of this) really, <br/>\nreally yelled at him. But never threatened him. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also watch very carefully what he watches on tv, and the computer <br/>\ngames he plays. He watches NOTHING but PBS and only a few of those <br/>\nshows. Also videos like Finding Nemo, etc. We are pretty careful. He <br/>\nhas *not* watched Shrek though many people recommended it. I saw 5 <br/>\nminutes of it and I knew it wasn&#39;t something i wanted him to see. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast week he was diagnosed with ADHD, and the doctor said he is <br/>\nborderline &quot;oppositional.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve thought that kids with ODD are probably learning this behavior <br/>\nat home. But other than those few times I really lost it and raised <br/>\nmy voice, I cannot think of anything in our home that would have <br/>\ncaused this. We have a very nurturing, loving, home. Not perfect, <br/>\nbut pretty good, by most standards. We took a positive parenting <br/>\nclass this fall, and the instructor mentioned to me that when she <br/>\nhas observed our interactions with our kids, that they are very <br/>\npositive and healthy. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m going on and on. Thanks for writing. I&#39;m just hoping for <br/>\nideas, because I have found that networking with other parents like <br/>\nthis can sometimes be hugely helpful, and people have ideas that <br/>\nwork great, but that I wouldn&#39;t have thought of it on my own. <br/>\n<br/>\nTHANKS again!<br/>\n<br/>\n:) Carly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140885507,"authorName":"gehrkes","from":"&quot;gehrkes&quot; &lt;gehrkes@...&gt;","profile":"gehrkes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: I hate you!!","postDate":"1072224879","msgId":86708,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJzYWxwZis5azVzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzOS4yOTYzNmFmMy4yZDFhMmY2NEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":86707,"nextInTopic":86709,"prevInTime":86707,"nextInTime":86709,"topicId":86696,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am taking my walk today with  my just turned eight year old daughter  and she says to me..
