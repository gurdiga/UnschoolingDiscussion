(sigh of relief)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the law can be a burden but it is doable.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind yourself an unschooling friendly evaluator!<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried a couple different approaches to keep a log but my favorite I<br/>\ndiscovered the year before we moved.<br/>\nI used a check list that had all the required subjects listed. With a<br/>\nsimple checkmark next to anything we even slightly touched upon the log<br/>\nwas a done deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the portfolio went, the kids and I played scavenger hunt all<br/>\nyear finding anything remotely academic looking to throw in there. I also<br/>\ntook a lot of pictures to put in there .<br/>\n<br/>\nE-mail me privately if you&#39;d like me to send you some examples of how I<br/>\ntackled the paperwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nSharon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Fri, 23 Mar 2001 07:46:14 -0500 &quot;mywheel&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mywheel@...\">mywheel@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just wanted to add to my last post, remember, I just started <br/>\n&gt; unschooling<br/>\n&gt; about a month ago.  :-)<br/>\n&gt; Anybody unschooling in PA??  I could use some suggestions on how to <br/>\n&gt; work my<br/>\n&gt; logs to go along with the unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Faith<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
