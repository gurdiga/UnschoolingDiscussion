My husband definitely<br/>\nhas a problem seeing my son so casual - but we&#39;ve talked about it, and he&#39;s<br/>\nstarting to understand that his son is not being disrespectful; he is truly<br/>\nuncomfortable in a lot of clothing.  At our Friday family dinner he wears a<br/>\nbutton-down short sleeved shirt (he prefers those to tees), because he knows<br/>\nit pleases his Dad and all the grandparents.  I never realized before I had<br/>\nchildren that personal preferences (especially in children) can really bug<br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first I thought it was a bit odd that he took out shoe laces, never wore<br/>\nsocks with any closed shoe or roller-skate, and was very aware about his<br/>\ncomfort level in his clothes.  But, hey, it&#39;s his body.  The only way it<br/>\naffects me is that I take him shopping with me because it wouldn&#39;t work out<br/>\nif I saw an article of clothing and just bought it for him. (I buy clothes<br/>\nfor his sister without her because she finds the whole shopping experience<br/>\ntoo much - the stores and decisions overwhelming.  She likes the idea of<br/>\ngetting presents - even if it is only socks!).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how my son would react to a cold climate where he would have to<br/>\nwear more clothing.  My kids have never been to the snow, and I&#39;ve only been<br/>\nin it twice in my life.  That might be a fun thing for us to do this winter<br/>\n- experience snow!        <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRebeca Z.<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95540,"nextTopicId":95621}}
