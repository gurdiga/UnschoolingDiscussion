Our","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1043679455\">Hello all! We&#39;re going to embark on a new stage of our homeschooling <br/>\njourney! On Feb 1, 2001 our family is going to travel the 48 states <br/>\nin a motor home! Our family includes myself, Aimee 28 yrs. old, my <br/>\nhusband Mark, 33 and our 2 daughters, Alexandria (age 7) and Tabitha <br/>\n(1 1/2).<br/>\nOur plan is to spend about a week in each state. The reason I&#39;m <br/>\nwriting is we&#39;d love to hear from homeschoolers in other states about <br/>\nwhat are some &quot;don&#39;t miss&quot; activities in your area/state, also we&#39;d <br/>\nlove to hear about what&#39;s unique to your area. <br/>\nHomeschoolers seem to often have great ideas that aren&#39;t listed in <br/>\n&quot;guide books&quot;! <br/>\nWe&#39;re not looking for amusement parks, one thing we&#39;re doing for sure <br/>\nare staying with Omish friends in Indiana so that we can really <br/>\nexperience their life. I&#39;m looking for any ideas along this line! <br/>\nThank you so much for your help in this matter!
