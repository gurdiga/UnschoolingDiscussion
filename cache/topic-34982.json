And the advice can be tailored specifically to them (slow<br/>\ndown or get your head out of the curriculum catalog or whatever).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She never gave them the opportunity to think of things to do themselves.<br/>\n&gt; She never allowed them to be bored and maybe think of something themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some have said it *sounded* like a few people here were doing that or were<br/>\nadvocating that, but I&#39;ve met both Sandra and Pam (and I&#39;ve met me too of<br/>\ncourse!, but can&#39;t vouch for anyone else) and what I saw at Sandra&#39;s and<br/>\nheard/saw with Pam was kids pursuing their own interests with plenty of<br/>\ndowntime, thinking loads of original thoughts, being offered opportunities<br/>\nand taking them up or turning them down depending on whether it interested<br/>\nthem. The kids were all leading active lives even though my presence had<br/>\nstolen the supposed cruise director away from them. And my family is like<br/>\nthat too, just with less action involved ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo where is the argument?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBeen having a FABULOUS time with the one, the only, zenmomma, life is good Mary while she is staying with us at our house for a few days. I&#39;m having so much fun that this list has taken a back seat to *more important matters* currently going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s been plenty of kids pursuing their own interests, her kids sharing interests with my kids and vice versa, adults sharing opportunities with kids, kids coercing adults into playing games (kidding! ;-), and lots of general interaction between adults and kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot much more to comment on, but I just wanted to share my happiness! I&#39;ll be sad when Mary and her kids leave but I think Sandra will be happy! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is Excellent! :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34971,"nextTopicId":33913}}
