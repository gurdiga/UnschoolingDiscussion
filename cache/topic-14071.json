I don&#39;t know how it would work with such an<br/>\nage-spread of kids, but having simple routines for greeting the morning,<br/>\ncoming together for reading or song, etc. has really helped make our day<br/>\nless chaotic and more enjoyable. I found the book &quot;Seven Times the Sun -<br/>\nGuiding your child through the rhythms of the day&quot; to be helpful. We have a<br/>\nsong for greeting the morning, we gather for breakfast, then we each<br/>\nplay/read on our own for awhile, we do &quot;circle time&quot; where we come together<br/>\nto read, sing, play games, then we do chores, and then usually our main<br/>\nactivity of the day.

The kids are:<br/>\n14yog; 11yob; 9yob;7yob;5yob;2yog and 11 month old<br/>\nboy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh thinks it&#39;s just a numbers game and feels that<br/>\nI&#39;m overwhelmed.  His answer is just to send them to<br/>\nschool.  But, I think that would just add other<br/>\nstresses and really believe that we&#39;d have to tackle<br/>\nthese underneath issues anyhow.  I am going to<br/>\ncounseling to work out some of the bits about my own<br/>\nparents and how I was raised...but when I bring up<br/>\nparenting there, I hear pretty much the same thing<br/>\nabout time-outs, 1-2-3 Magic, etc...and that&#39;s not<br/>\nwhat I&#39;m looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read tons of parenting materials, but can&#39;t seem<br/>\nto find or articulate exactly what I want and I&#39;m<br/>\nwondering if anyone just has some good common sense<br/>\nideas or whatever.  It doesn&#39;t have to be from a book.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to punish my kids in any way right now. <br/>\nI think it just adds to the negative cycle.  But, it<br/>\ntakes SOOOOO much time to be the patient explainer too<br/>\nand I just don&#39;t know if I have it in me with them<br/>\nhome all the time.  I&#39;ve been on the TCS list in the<br/>\npast, too, but disagree with the strident quality that<br/>\nsometimes comes across there; plus I do think that<br/>\nthere are times when kids just plain are doing<br/>\nsomething wrong and need to be helped not to do it. <br/>\nAs do adults!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI read Emotionally Intelligent Parenting, but they<br/>\nadvocate a thing called &quot;Chill-Out.&quot;  They say the<br/>\nidea is to get the kid to take responsibility for<br/>\ntheir own behavior and I agree with that logic. <br/>\nUnfortunately, when it&#39;s backed up by Mom or Dad<br/>\nsaying...go chill out and administering the time<br/>\nclock, then who is it who is controlling behvior?  <br/>\nYou can SAY anything you want to kids, but the proof<br/>\nis in the pudding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have one child who is very cooperative when he&#39;s<br/>\napproached gently (duh, aren&#39;t we all!) but as soon as<br/>\nhe smells anything that even remotely seems like a<br/>\npunishment, he&#39;ll dig in his heels and pull like a<br/>\nmule.  So what do you do then...add more punishment<br/>\nand it&#39;s a vicious cycle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m asking for here is practical advice<br/>\non how to live a more gentle cooperative life with so<br/>\nmany people under one roof.  But, please answer even<br/>\nif you don&#39;t have a big family.  Many brains make for<br/>\nbetter solutions!  I think...or is it too many brains<br/>\nmuddle the soup?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy gut feeling tells me that there is a way to do this<br/>\nwithout any kind of restrictions or &quot;punishments,&quot;<br/>\ntime-outs of any kind.  But my dh and many other<br/>\npeople tell me I&#39;m too idealistic.  I don&#39;t mean to<br/>\nsay I will never be human and yell or get irritated. <br/>\nI just think there&#39;s got to be a way of parenting<br/>\nwithout controlling them.  How do you develop this<br/>\nthing called self-control and encourage them to set<br/>\nlimits?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not looking for a formula.  I was, but I&#39;ve had to<br/>\nadmit the futility of that route.  So, any bits of<br/>\nwisdom picked up from your collective experiences<br/>\nwould help immensely!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all!<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol B.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14092,"nextTopicId":14127}}
