I don&#39;t know how correct this is in the world of <br/>\nunschooling, (yet) but if my child &quot;refused&quot; to get dressed then they would go in <br/>\nwhatever they were wearing.  And it would depend on how important it was where I was <br/>\ngoing.  I look at it this way-I&#39;ve gone to the emergency in my pajamas <br/>\nbecause it was necessary.  Mind you, I didn&#39;t say my teddy, I said my pajamas.  And <br/>\nI did once run out of my house naked because it was on fire in the room my <br/>\nclothes were in, but that is another story.  Consequently, my husband did not put <br/>\nme over his knee and spank me.  I also have seen adults throw tantrums in <br/>\npublic-just go to the customer service counter once in awhile.  And if my <br/>\nchildren are hiding under clothes racks in Walmart and running out in cars, my focus <br/>\nobviously is not with my children and they should not be with me if I am not <br/>\nprepared to watch them in public and protect from harm in the first place.  <br/>\nThat is just my take on it; I&#39;m interested to hear how others respond.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83485,"nextTopicId":83482}}
