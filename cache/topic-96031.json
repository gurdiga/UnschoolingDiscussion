It&#39;s called Winrock, and one day <br/>\nwhen I was there with Marty and Holly both, I was pointing out where the bank, <br/>\ngrocery store and drug store used to be.  The apartment buildings are still <br/>\nthere and very well maintained.  The hotel is still in business.  The mall has <br/>\nchanged, and no longer has a bank, grocery, pharmacy, bakery as it once had.  The <br/>\nomni-whatever theatre (I forget the name of a three-projector, <br/>\nthree-angled-screen thing is used to be) is now a multiplex, still open.<br/>\n<br/>\nI reminded them of the Disneyesque visions of the cities of the future <br/>\nthey&#39;ve seen in books and at &quot;Tomorrowland,&quot; and that the idea was someone could <br/>\nlive in those apartments and walk to everything they would need.  For a while it <br/>\nworked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat came up just because of questions about freeways.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the interstate system was designed and financed for the purpose of quick <br/>\ntroop movement in case something like WWII happened again.  One mile in five <br/>\nis supposed to be straight so it can be used as a runway.   That&#39;s not much <br/>\ndiscussed anymore.  Your son might be interested in some of that history, as it <br/>\ncomes along in his life.  Too much at once might not be fun, but as the <br/>\nconnections come along naturally, you might point them out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has his whole life to make those connections.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot of Rt. 66 research, photo-journalism kind of stuff you might <br/>\nfind at libraries or somewhere and let him see.  Where did it end up in <br/>\nCalifornia?  Bakersfield, maybe?  Barstow?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe collecting (gradually, not in a frenzy &lt;g&gt;) photos of construction over <br/>\nthe years, of earthquake damage, stuff like that, would be fun for him.

I&#39;m Shell, mom to 2 boys in So Cal who began officially <br/>\nhomeschooling a few weeks ago.  My oldest son just turned 5 and was <br/>\ndiagnosed with Autism 2.5 years ago.  He was in a full-day special <br/>\npreschool for all of the past 2.5 years, with small breaks in the <br/>\nsummers.  At the time I felt that it was the best path for him, and <br/>\nwe were very fortunate to have a very loving and nurturing team of <br/>\nteachers and therapists during the journey.  When I realized that we <br/>\nwere on the cusp of Kindergarten, my long-held ideas of homeschooling <br/>\nand unschooling came back to life!  Drew is a very atypical autistic -<br/>\n very social, loving, talkative (my ears ring at day&#39;s end!), bright, <br/>\ncurious.  An incredible little guy. :)  It finally dawned on me that <br/>\nI can absolutely homeschool him - I don&#39;t need specialists to guide <br/>\nhim on his path.  I *am* the specialist on Drew...and more to the <br/>\npoint, DREW is the specialist on Drew. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading this list for a few weeks, and have been reading <br/>\nquite a bit at unschooling.com and Sanda&#39;s &quot;Radical Unschooling&quot; site <br/>\nfor several months.  I&#39;m unlurking to intro myself and to request <br/>\nsome ideas and direction from the wise ones here. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ideas about unschooling were flimsy at best until recently.  I had <br/>\nread some John Holt works about 6 years ago and thought, &quot;Now THAT is <br/>\nhow learning and living should be!&quot;  Then I started reading here and <br/>\nthe other mentioned sites, and my mind began to *really* open up.  <br/>\nThe control issues are killer for me, but make so so much sense.  <br/>\nWe&#39;re loosening up and it&#39;s so liberating. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the part where I&#39;d like some ideas.  Drew is very interested <br/>\nin the streets and freeways locally.  Living in Orange County, CA <br/>\nthere is no lack of freeways, lol!  I recently bought him some AAA <br/>\nfold-out paper maps and they are on his bedroom wall.  He discovered <br/>\nthe Thomas Guide in the car today and was in heaven. :)  He knows all <br/>\nthe street names, where the freeway extrances/exits are and what <br/>\nnumbers they are.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhere would you suggest I go with this?  I&#39;m not trying to &quot;teach&quot; <br/>\nhim anything, not trying to make this &quot;schooly&quot;.  Just trying to find <br/>\nways to feed his interest and possibly bring him ideas and <br/>\nexperiences that he wouldn&#39;t have known about otherwise.  I know this <br/>\nshould be relatively simple to do, but for some reason I just can&#39;t <br/>\nget my creative juices going.  Blech.  I&#39;ve been in &quot;somebody-else-<br/>\nstimulate-my-child&quot; mode for WAY too long, you know?
