We&#39;ll discuss the options like creating something else<br/>\nor eating what we&#39;ve got in the house.

Going out after dark <br/>\nto get something someone craves isn&#39;t, unless people were restless and wanting <br/>\nto get out anyway, or needed to pick someone up from a movie or a friend&#39;s <br/>\nhouse, or whatever honest out-of-house reason there might be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only things people should really be expected to go out for after dark, I <br/>\nthink, are necessities like toilet paper, maybe milk, drinking water if they <br/>\nhave bad water and no filter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two or three times gone out with Holly, walking to the Texaco just for <br/>\ncandy or the walk.  We could&#39;ve driven, but it was more the nighttime <br/>\nadventure than the candy bar.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one of mine says &quot;I wish we had M&Ms&quot; I&#39;ll say &quot;Put it on the list and <br/>\nI&#39;ll get some tomorrow.&quot;  (or if groceries were just bought, &quot;next time&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My kids can have what they want&quot; (which gets said a lot by many longterm <br/>\nunschoolers) doesn&#39;t mean &quot;... in the whole earth, any time of the day or night.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t limit my kids&#39; video games&quot; does NOT mean &quot;I buy them every game and <br/>\nsystem that comes out.&quot;  It means the parents aren&#39;t forbidding or timing or <br/>\nwhatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if we say &quot;Whatever&#39;s in the house, they can have,&quot; some newer readers <br/>\nseem to smugly determine just never to have candy or video games in the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe extremes aren&#39;t so good.  Neither deprivation nor crazily trying to <br/>\nprovide everything a child has ever seen or imagined is going to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163132749,"authorName":"ivorygrace7@aol.com","from":"ivorygrace7@...","profile":"ivorygrace7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: &quot;a taste of his own medicine&quot; andother cruel ...","postDate":"1084716581","msgId":94133,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZkLjI5YjFiNDk0LjJkZDhkMDI1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":94134,"prevInTime":94132,"nextInTime":94134,"topicId":94133,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/16/2004 10:01:08 AM Eastern Standard Time, abzb@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-41129100\">In a message dated 5/16/2004 10:01:08 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abzb@...\">abzb@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I think if we never brought up our needs our kids wouldn&#39;t get a chance to<br/>\nsee us as whole human beings all interacting in this creation that is our<br/>\nfamily.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that one of the reasons my kids are so sensitive to my needs is that <br/>\nI&#39;m sensitive to theirs.
