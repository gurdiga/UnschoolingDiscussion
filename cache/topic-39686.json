In fact, I&#39;m more likely to fool with it myself and then &quot;let&quot; <br/>\nthe kids do one too, if they ask. Or - I might say, &quot;Here - I had this cool <br/>\nidea about multiplying - wanna see it?&quot; OR - a kid might moan and groan that <br/>\nthey don&#39;t know multiplication facts and it is slowing them down in some <br/>\nother activity their trying to pursue - so I might tell them that I have some <br/>\npretty fun ways in mind that can help them learn them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is always an offer and it is always something that they can take or leave <br/>\nor expand or cut short or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree - a formal phonics or math program would not be appropriate to <br/>\nsuggest on an unschooling list. Thanks for pointing that out, Rachel, and <br/>\ngiving me the opportunity to clarify how I intended the multiplication stuff <br/>\nto be considered - just as something fun that kids and parents might enjoy, <br/>\nnot as a &quot;lesson,&quot; by any means.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should have seen me sitting here drawing the spirolaterals the other day <br/>\n-- I had a bunch of kids here and after 5 minutes they were all drawing and <br/>\ncoloring too.

From an unschooling point of view, the <br/>\ntime to help a child with phonics is when they&#39;re eager to learn and asking <br/>\nabout letters and sounds and such. The time to stop with the phonics is when <br/>\ntheir particular question has been answered and they&#39;ve moved on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe time for multiplication is when it would be useful for the child to <br/>\nknow. Like &quot;How many weeks allowance will it take for me to save up $100?&quot; <br/>\nFor that, it&#39;s pretty useful to be able to count by 5&#39;s or 10&#39;s or whatever <br/>\nthe weekly allowance is. That&#39;s a good intro into multiplication. Do they <br/>\nneed to memorize multiplication tables and do it by age 9? The schools would <br/>\ntell us yes. An unschooler would say no, they need an understanding of how <br/>\nnumbers work and eventually some numbers rules to get to the answers they <br/>\nneed more easily. And they&#39;ll get that through using the numbers. Just like <br/>\nthey&#39;ll get the phonics concepts a little at a time as they&#39;re figuring out <br/>\nreading.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;PS I am new too.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Welcome Rachel and all you other newbies who might be lurking out there. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\">http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116874761,"authorName":"Rachel Mullin","from":"&quot;Rachel Mullin&quot; &lt;rachel@...&gt;","profile":"rachelm1198","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Stop scaring the newbie!","postDate":"1028400120","msgId":39699,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYwODIyN0IzNDU1ODZBNDI4QThGNEVFOUMyMkUxNzZGMTAzQ0Q3QE1BSUwtMDJWUy5hdGxhcmdlLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":39698,"nextInTopic":39700,"prevInTime":39698,"nextInTime":39700,"topicId":39686,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I too have just been deleting them, and wondering why phonics and times tables is relevant to the *unschooling* list anyway, LOL.

Sorry you&#39;re feeling scared by all this talk and sorry <br/>\nif I contributed to that feeling. :-/ My posts on the subject were supposed <br/>\nto have the opposite effect. I truly believe that parents can calm down <br/>\nabout &quot;teaching&quot; their 6 year olds to read. I&#39;ve watched both of my kids <br/>\nlearn using the &quot;methods&quot; that worked best for them. It really did work best <br/>\nwhen I did NOT impose any one method on them. It also helps to know that 6 <br/>\nis not some magical reading age, no matter what the school system thinks. <br/>\nEach kid is different and unschooling can allow for those differences.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if your 6 year old is trying to sound out words, terrific! Help him <br/>\nalong and give him those letter sounds and blends. If he&#39;s trying to read <br/>\nsigns on the road, great! Help him read them without a long instruction <br/>\nlesson on why the letters make those sounds. Give him the info he needs and <br/>\nwants and watch him do the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAround here, we read tons of books at all different levels. We played with <br/>\nthose letters on the fridge (Hi Ned :o)), we labelled stuff in the house, <br/>\nwrote words in the sand, made our names out of clay, read cereal boxes and <br/>\nstop signs. We used Bob Books, Dr. Seuss, Magic Treehouse books, comics, <br/>\nPokemon cards, magazines, TV captioning, all of it. We did what was fun and <br/>\nleft behind the rest. Casey even loved workbooks when she was 3 and 4 and <br/>\ndid those non-stop it seemed. Conor did none. They are 8 and 13 now and both <br/>\nreading. It happens. Please try not to worry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I also find the verbal face slapping very disconcerting.

I&#39;ve never seen a newbie (or anyone really) get <br/>\nslapped around. You will get disagreed with, though, if you have an &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nright and you&#39;re wrong&quot; style of stating things. But that&#39;s how lots of us <br/>\nhave come to understand unschooling better, by challenging our own belief <br/>\nsystems. I, personally, try to be kind when disagreeing.

That is the ONLY advice that will work <br/>\n(that sounds so arrogant - but what I mean is to emphasize that I have had <br/>\nyears and years of experience watching lists and have never once seen any <br/>\nother option work &lt;G&gt;). For one thing, what seems antagonistic to you might <br/>\nnot to people who might have known each other for years, as many people here <br/>\nhave. And - besides, it never ever ever does any good on any list to try to <br/>\nchange anybody else&#39;s posting style. It clogs up the list with posts about <br/>\nposting style rather than content and nobody ever changes because someone <br/>\ncomplains, they just dig in their heels. Things get uglier and nastier the <br/>\nmore people complain that they think things are ugly and nasty. Honest. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo - use your delete key or just sigh and go on when something doesn&#39;t seem <br/>\nnice to you. If there are ideas or information that are useful - take them <br/>\ngladly and ignore anything that isn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of times the heated responses and disagreements generate a lot of light, <br/>\nthough, so don&#39;t be too eager to douse them. Sometimes it is easier to <br/>\narticulate why we think the way we do when we&#39;re arguing against what someone <br/>\nelse thinks - we sometimes change our minds or we clarify or fine-tune our <br/>\nown ideas and we have to think harder about WHY we believe what we do. It can <br/>\nbe argumentative and sound pretty hostile - but it is often very productive, <br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling can be frustrating and annoying - because we often want &quot;answers&quot; <br/>\nand what we get are a bunch of strongly held conflicting ideas. But if you <br/>\nyou let them sink in and float around and knock against each other in your <br/>\nbrain -- while you fool around with your kids and oberve other people with <br/>\ntheir kids -- your own personal decisions and style will slowly develop out <br/>\nof the mix.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59554467,"authorName":"Charles L Whittom Jr","from":"&quot;Charles L Whittom Jr&quot; &lt;cwhittomjr@...&gt;","profile":"cywhittom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Stop scaring the newbie!","postDate":"1028342404","msgId":39687,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWUwMWMyM2E5NyQxMmVlMTIyMCQ2ODAxYThjMEBWQUlPPg==","referencesHeader":"PEYxMTFKMFhqRVdZSzlTRExTWlowMDAyMzBkZUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":39686,"nextInTopic":39688,"prevInTime":39686,"nextInTime":39688,"topicId":39686,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Joz, I am glad to see someone (like yourself) that is new to hsing-unschooling take a stand.
