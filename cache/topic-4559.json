It is 6 months old. The person selling has a <br/>\nlarge horse farm for carriages, and is depleting part of her business. Today, <br/>\nwe shall go and see what she has to offer. There are 15 horses for sale, from <br/>\nthe colt to older full size horses. I know that I would have to have the <br/>\nchildren break the colt and that with it only growing to 4 ft, chances are <br/>\nthe children will have a horse, not me. It is my dream to have horses, <br/>\nthough. Regardless of papers, breed, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks everyone for answering. I was close to tears when dh gave the &quot;ok&quot; and <br/>\nhanded me the telephone! Now to find a place for it to go. I think that the <br/>\ncity would go nuts over a horse (they hated the chickens)...<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nStephanie<br/>\nTeacher and Mommy of 4 homeschooling fanatics, wife to the best principal, <br/>\nprotector of many pets and wild ones, and unpublished writer.<br/>\n       I think that I will move closer to the gym, that way between sets,<br/>\n       I can run home and eat something sweet to keep up my energy! s.<br/>\n    Believe in others, and be a part; believe in yourself, and be the lead. s.<br/>\n            ***Life&#39;s Learnings Academy - Protecting Our Children***<br/>\n        IT&#39;S GREAT TO LEARN WHERE THE PRINCIPAL LOVES YOU<br/>\n                           ICQ: 43428000     AOL IM: Lifeslearn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4536,"nextTopicId":4458}}
