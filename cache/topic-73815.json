I don&#39;t want to part with them though. Got them at Salvation Army on 1/2 price day and still paid $9 for them. They&#39;re worn and I really do need them for riding, but the color&#39;s kind of a joke around here. They work great though. <br/>\nMary T. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: These boots were made for walkin&#39;","postDate":"1055440919","msgId":73850,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNlLjM4YjdjMzljLjJjMWExYTE3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":73815,"nextInTopic":75344,"prevInTime":73849,"nextInTime":73851,"topicId":73815,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/12/2003 10:20:33 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...
