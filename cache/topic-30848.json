We have always had a family bed. I might<br/>\nalso add that they all breast fed until they were around 5.  My partner and<br/>\nI were together for almost 9 years before we had any kids so sex where ever<br/>\nand when ever wasn&#39;t an issue. Our kids are now 18, 12 and 7. The 18 year<br/>\nold slept in our family bed or his bed with dad or little brother or little<br/>\nbrothers bed etc...until he was 13 or 14. He never sleeps with any of us<br/>\nanymore :~( and we miss him.<br/>\n&gt; We have a king size with a single on the side for the four of us who are<br/>\nleft. Our 12 year old is with us unless he stays out at a friends or has<br/>\nfriends sleep over. Our baby, who&#39;s 7 already, is still always with us. They<br/>\nall have a bedroom complete with a bed and at times, if someone is sick,<br/>\ncan&#39;t sleep, or wants to have sex, we play musical beds and sleep where ever<br/>\nwe&#39;re most comfy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My oldest was extremely clingy and never slept out, except for at my moms,<br/>\nuntil he was well into his teens. I admit I was worried and had many well<br/>\nmeaning people warning me, when he refused to attend sleep overs or even<br/>\nlarge parties with friends, and we pushed him at times always with negative<br/>\nresults. Anyway, to make a long story short, he just got back from a 2 week<br/>\nroad trip to Key Largo with his old girl friend and we spent the time<br/>\ncleaning and decorating his room to keep our loneliness at bay :~).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; These years of family living have been the best years of my life and I&#39;m<br/>\nnot looking forward to an empty bed and a clean house. Soon I&#39;ll be looking<br/>\nfor a support group for people who didn&#39;t send their kids to their rooms or<br/>\nto school and can&#39;t live with the peace and quiet. Or maybe we&#39;ll open our<br/>\ndoors to some wayward teens or become foster parents or something.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Enjoy your little one and don&#39;t be afraid of being too close. These are<br/>\nyour years together, make the most of it, it will be over before ya know<br/>\nit!!!! You can have sex anywhere but in bed, so what. Just hope your libido<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t disappear when she does:~)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Leslie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Candy<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, January 08, 2002 8:58 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: [a moment&#39;s peace<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I am so glad I found this group!!! My husband and I agonize over this<br/>\nvery thing. Our daughter is 4 and an only child.  If she can&#39;t sleep with<br/>\nus, she cries,  and after listening to sobbing for a while, it seems to<br/>\nreally put a damper on the mood. :o) We have tried doing a schedule of one<br/>\nnight in our bed, and one night in her&#39;s, but I have to admit that I am so<br/>\nused to her sleeping with us, that if she does not wind up in our bed, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t sleep, I keep checking on her because it is so unusual!! I know it is<br/>\nimportant not completely neglect your marriage, but I think my daughter&#39;s<br/>\nneed to sleep with us has actually gotten worse the last 6 months instead of<br/>\nbetter.  I always thought as she got older, her need for independence would<br/>\nincrease, and she would enjoy her room. We have even tried completely<br/>\nremodeling her room to make it what she likes. We got her involved in<br/>\nchoosing the theme, colors, furniture, ect. we got her a bed that looks like<br/>\na house, even went out and found a pink TV to match everything! She does<br/>\nlove her room, but not enough to sleep in it.We are somewhat at a loss of<br/>\nwhat to do next! She really does not take naps very often any more, and it<br/>\njust breaks my heart to tell her she can&#39;t sleep with us. Any suggestions on<br/>\nwhat has worked? I just joined the group yesterday, so I may have missed<br/>\nearlier discussions.<br/>\n&gt;                  Candy Oliver<br/>\n&gt;     ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;     From: Lorraine Goods<br/>\n&gt;     To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;     Sent: Tuesday, January 08, 2002 5:13 PM<br/>\n&gt;     Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: [a moment&#39;s peace<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     On Tue, 8 Jan 2002 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KingsDaughterThe@...\">KingsDaughterThe@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     &gt; I could really relate when you say you just can&#39;t relax.

I guess bc I have just one child I would feel guilty<br/>\nshutting<br/>\n&gt;     my door to him at night.
