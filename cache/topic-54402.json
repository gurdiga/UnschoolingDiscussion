She","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-530893604\">My 5dd had absolutely no interest in going to school until she saw the<br/>\nbig yellow school busses on the PBS cartoons (I think it was actually<br/>\nArthur). She wanted desperately to ride on one. We kind of let it go,<br/>\nfiguring she would get past this, but she didn&#39;t. They made it look like<br/>\nso much fun. One day my husband comes up the driveway with a yellow<br/>\nschool bus. A local school district was selling their perfectly good band<br/>\nbus, and he was at the right place at the right time, and it was really<br/>\ncheap. So now my DD&#39;s have a bus of their very own, and they play in it<br/>\nand go for occasional rides. I realize that this is not practical for<br/>\neveryone, but I thought it was a super sweet thing to do on my hubby&#39;s<br/>\npart, and the desire to go to school for the sake of the bus ride is in<br/>\nthe past.<br/>\nWende<br/>\nOn Sat, 11 Jan 2003 23:23:25 -0000 &quot;kayb85 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheran@...\">sheran@...</a>&gt;&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheran@...\">sheran@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; There are complaints I could make about Sesame Street, about <br/>\n&gt; specific moments <br/>\n&gt; &gt; or little videos which are really outdated and I wish they hadn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; shown.  I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; wish they had promoted breastfeeding instead of showing bottlefed <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; babies.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; But musically it&#39;s wonderful.  Every musical style ever was <br/>\n&gt; represented.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I saw a video on Sesame Street that showed kids getting ready for <br/>\n&gt; preschool, and showed kids what a fun thing preschool was.  I wish, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; when they do things to get kids excited about school and show them <br/>\n&gt; getting on these cool yellow school buses, that they would also show <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; the kids at home who don&#39;t go to school, and how much fun they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; having too.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of course that&#39;s not true of only Sesame Street, but of most tv <br/>\n&gt; shows <br/>\n&gt; in general. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sheila<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
