I didn&#39;t use much of anything I learned <br/>\nformally.  I think school was a waste of time then and it&#39;s even worse now.  <br/>\nToday it seems that it is based on crowd control, conformity, and undue <br/>\ndiscipline.  I never had a &quot;bad&quot; school life, I was rarely ever picked on, I did <br/>\npretty well, and it was a good social place when we got a minute to socialize.  <br/>\nBut I can look back now and say I didn&#39;t HATE school but it was a HUGE waste of <br/>\n12 years and college wasn&#39;t a whole lot different.  I want that sparkle to <br/>\nstay in my kids eyes for as long as it can, hopefully forever.  They&#39;re born <br/>\nwith it, they are naturally amazed at so many things, thinking and figuring is <br/>\nnatural, how can anyone say that school can help them keep that love of life and <br/>\nlearning alive?  I had a million SPARKS as a child, especially during school <br/>\nbreaks and Summer, but every bit of those sparks were diminished and <br/>\neventually put out by going back to school and being forced to learn stuff that had no <br/>\nmeaning to me at the time.  But I did well, because I had to, because I was <br/>\ndrilled to, because I was forced to.  I don&#39;t want that for mine, and I bet you <br/>\ndon&#39;t either.  That might be why you are exploring this whole &quot;NEW&quot; world.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt; LOL mine was, too! Still enjoys watching them. And often, when he is <br/>\nthrowing <br/>\nsomething away, he will sloooooowly lift it in both hands, with both arms <br/>\nlocked straight, above his head, and &quot;dump&quot; it into the trashcan!! It is VERY <br/>\n<br/>\nfrustrating when I&#39;m in a hurry, but if I bite my tongue and realise this <br/>\nstage <br/>\nwill not last very long (and how adoreable it really is!) I&#39;ll relax in a few <br/>\n<br/>\nmoments and enjoy it. Homeschooling is HARD! LOL Waaaay more self-control <br/>\nthan <br/>\nI ever imagined needing! :~)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are wonderful at every stage but infancy and toddlerhood hold a special <br/>\nplace for me.  I do the same thing, I get in a hurry sometimes and at the cost <br/>\nof everyone else, I&#39;m hollering to get out the door or whatever and I am <br/>\nlearning to take it easier.  Before my son went to Kindergarten this year, we were <br/>\npretty much an unschooling family, I just didn&#39;t know it had a name.  But now <br/>\nthat he is in K, our lives are hectic and regimented, confining, and <br/>\nrestricted.  He has chosen to finish this year but is adament about not going back.  <br/>\nAnd I am soooo grateful for that.

So we checked some books <br/>\nout of the library. Then after we read the sugar-coated versions, I <br/>\nread some sections from &quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me&quot; - what <br/>\nfollowed was a really interesting discussion about how history gets <br/>\nto be history, how certain people get venerated enough to have a <br/>\nwhole day named after them but maybe they aren&#39;t really great people <br/>\nor even very nice people, how our cultural mythology gets built, etc. <br/>\nBecause it was an interesting and engaging discussion over several <br/>\ndays/weeks, and because the kids initiated it, I&#39;m sure they retained <br/>\na lot more (not to mention a lot more *accurate*) info than I ever <br/>\ngot in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that unschooling has shown me is that our kids live in the <br/>\nreal world.

Like Joyce said - they&#39;ll know about ice cream and they&#39;ll <br/>\nknow about Columbus, sooner or later. Sometimes the breadth of what <br/>\nthey know truly amazes me.

Coumbus get&#39;s mentioned in commercials on Columbus Day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we look at what&#39;s available in the world and divide it into things they<br/>\nlike/probably will like now and things they don&#39;t like/probably won&#39;t like<br/>\nnow -- but their tastes will change and those aren&#39;t fixed categories --<br/>\nthen the like pile will contain good picture books. Some will be about teddy<br/>\nbears and ice cream and spies and mysteries and different kinds of pasta and<br/>\nsamurai and Columbus and trains and Pokemon. Columbus is just one of many<br/>\nthings in the world. In real life he isn&#39;t separate from teddy bears. He&#39;s a<br/>\nlike or not like, part of a joke or not part of a joke, in a TV show or not<br/>\nin a TV show.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you worry that you&#39;re kids won&#39;t find out about ice cream? Some kids<br/>\nactually don&#39;t like ice cream. But they know about and have sampled it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with Columbus. Treat him like ice cream. Or turtles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ll think what they hear about him is interesting or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I worry about that<br/>\n&gt; myself, sometimes, but then I try to remember that not everyone needs every<br/>\n&gt; thing <br/>\n&gt; they had to learn in school for their daily life/career.

And they learn what they<br/>\nneed by using it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey things they don&#39;t use are the things they don&#39;t need.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat most people don&#39;t understand about learning is that you don&#39;t need to<br/>\nunderstand something in order to use it. You learn how to use it by using<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about how kids learn English. They have no clue how to use English. In<br/>\nfact they don&#39;t even know what English is. But they find bits and pieces of<br/>\nEnglish -- and other tools like pointing -- useful to get what they need.<br/>\nSaying &quot;ook&quot; gets them milk more efficiently than crying. So, as they use<br/>\n&quot;ook&quot; and get feedback -- like Mom saying &quot;Oh, you want some milk?&quot; -- they<br/>\nget better at English as a side effect. We don&#39;t need to explain the proper<br/>\nrules of English to them before they start using it. English is just there<br/>\nand they pick up the parts that look useful for what they want to get. They<br/>\ndon&#39;t even need to use English properly. But properly comes along as a side<br/>\neffect of using English. As they use English they find ways that work better<br/>\nto get what they wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning works that way for math and science and history.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut those -- like English -- aren&#39;t actually things to learn. They&#39;re<br/>\n*tools* to help you do something else. But you don&#39;t need to know the right<br/>\nway to use a tool to use it. You just use it to get something else. How well<br/>\nthe tool works gives you feed back on using it better.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter asks how long until Daddy gets home. We use math as a tool to<br/>\nfigure that out. The point isn&#39;t the math. The point is finding out &quot;how<br/>\nlong until.&quot; Math is a side effect of wanting to know &quot;how long until.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA hammer is a tool, not the point. The point is to build a bird house. How<br/>\nwell the nails go in gives us feedback on how to build the house better and,<br/>\nas a side effect, how to use a hammer better. But the point is never the<br/>\nhammer. It&#39;s always what you&#39;re using the hammer to make.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77070457,"authorName":"Sanguinegirl83@aol.com","from":"Sanguinegirl83@...","profile":"sanguinegirl83","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Sparks!!","postDate":"1082538702","msgId":92955,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyYS4zZmJmN2JkMi4yZGI3OTRjZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":92943,"nextInTopic":92957,"prevInTime":92954,"nextInTime":92956,"topicId":92865,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/20/2004 5:42:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

I <br/>\nsee my kids as sponges though, they are sucking up every bit of what they are <br/>\nexposed to.  So exposure works for us.  My oldest is 6 and the other is 2.5 <br/>\nand they both absorb so much, and I don&#39;t always see it when it happens, <br/>\nsometimes it may come later or may come from out of nowhere.  But it comes and <br/>\nthat&#39;s the point.  Once, when my 6 yr old was 3, DH and I were gabbing away in the <br/>\ncar and DS was listening to music in the back of the van (speakers on in back, <br/>\nnot in front) and I said something like, &quot;Thanks Hon, you&#39;re as strong as an <br/>\nOx.&quot;  And from the back comes, &quot;MaMaaaa, you&#39;re speaking metaphorically!&quot;  <br/>\nWell, to say the least DH and I both looked at each other and I nearly wrecked <br/>\nthe van cuz it was so wild to hear my 3 yr old say that.  And we have no idea <br/>\nwhere it came from, we asked and he said I dunno.  But he was right and he still <br/>\nknows what it means, he absorbed it for good.  One of my professors used to <br/>\nsay that by the end of the semester he&#39;ll be glad to send us home so we can <br/>\ndump our &quot;disks&quot; and come back fresh next time.  And this is sooooo true, my <br/>\n&quot;disk&quot; crashed hard and I remember little about a lot of things from school <br/>\nbecause it was jammed in and memorized for the time being and without meaning, but I <br/>\nretained what was of interest to me from those few teachers who didn&#39;t teach <br/>\nas much as they shared their knowledge and love of a subject.  Imagine if <br/>\neverything could be interesting, if we could stay &quot;easily amused.&quot;  Well, I think <br/>\nkids can.  Your son will have sparks and is probably having them now, unless <br/>\nhe gets up and does nothing but stare at a wall (which he may just love the <br/>\ntexture, the wallpaper, the tint :0) ) then he already has interests, he does <br/>\nstuff, and stuff will become sparks and possibly flames and if he needs you, jump <br/>\nin, facilitate and expose.  If he doesn&#39;t then just let him go about it.  I <br/>\nhave a BSBA with a minor in Biology and so I schooled for a long time but I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t give you but one sentence on Columbus right now and that&#39;s not because <br/>\nthere was never a spark or that it doesn&#39;t interest me, I just flat out didn&#39;t <br/>\nNEED it so I didn&#39;t retain it.  My 6 yr old never knew what a president was <br/>\nuntil he started learning about currency and the pictures on the money sparked <br/>\nhis interest and we got a book about presidents and we read it together and we <br/>\nboth retained a lot of it by choice, before this, I couldn&#39;t give you a <br/>\nsentence on any president either (well at least not fact, but I could do opinion :0) <br/>\n)  My 2.5 year old is fascinated with the trash trucks when they come.
