I had a <br/>\nMedela pump in style and got very proficient at it.  Nursed my first until 11 <br/>\nmonths when I had to stop because of a placenta preevia bleed, was <br/>\nhospitalized and needed to end all possible uterine contractions or my <br/>\ndaughter would have come even earlier.  I used the pump with my daughter too, <br/>\nbut as soon as I quit my job, she refused to take a bottle and I ended up <br/>\ntossing a lot of the frozen breast milk.  I got so good with that machine <br/>\nthat my best place to pump was in the car, in traffic on my way to and from <br/>\nwork.  It was a little tricky to operate a stick shift and the pump, but it <br/>\nworked fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know, however, that pumps and their efficiency is a highly personal <br/>\nthing for each mom.  I never could hand express, but know a lot of moms who <br/>\ncould and did that exclusively.<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"hsmominoz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] breast pumps","postDate":"1035605473","msgId":48158,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyNi4xOTIxOGM1MC4yYWViNmZlMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48094,"nextInTopic":48297,"prevInTime":48157,"nextInTime":48159,"topicId":48083,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/25/02 6:18:57 PM Central Daylight Time, ...
