The Genetically Engineered Food Right to Know","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1158019333\">Sorry if this is a cross-post or if it is considered spamming.  If it is,<br/>\ndelete here and accept my apologies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Genetically Engineered Food Right to Know Act (HR 3377 and S 2080) are<br/>\ncurrently before Congress.  More information on these can be found at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thecampaign.org/newsupdates/index.htm\">http://www.thecampaign.org/newsupdates/index.htm</a> or you can sign up for the<br/>\ne-lists at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thecampaign.org/elists.htm\">http://www.thecampaign.org/elists.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve included a suggested letter to send to your Senators and Congressmen.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\nIf Ignorance Is Bliss Why Aren&#39;t More People Happy?<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Representative/Senator:<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very concerned that I am eating genetically engineered foods without<br/>\nbeing told that fact.  I am writing to request that you co-sponsor (H.R.<br/>\n3377 or S. 2080), the Genetically Engineered Food Right to Know Act.  This<br/>\nlegislation will ensure the right of Americans to know whether the foods we<br/>\npurchase have been genetically altered in any way.<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic opinion polls show the vast majority of Americans want these foods<br/>\nlabeled.  (81% in a January 11, 1999, Time magazine poll)  Yet the FDA is<br/>\nallowing genetically engineered foods to come to market unlabeled arguing<br/>\nthese foods are no different than those produced by typical hyridization. <br/>\nBut studies show crops modified by genetic engineering may contain<br/>\nincreased levels of natural toxins and lower levels of valuable nutrients.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe FDA states that if a genetically engineered food contains a known<br/>\nallergen it must be labeled.  But what about the unknown allergens taht may<br/>\nbe created int hese experiemental foods?  Genetically engineered crops<br/>\noften contain proteins that have never before been consumed by humans as<br/>\nfood.  Further, there are serious questions about the environmental safety<br/>\nof these crops.  And many people have moral and religious concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nFood manufacturers are selling potatoes and corn that have been genetically<br/>\nengineered to contain the Bt toxin (Bacillus thuringiensis).  The Bt toxin<br/>\nstays in the cell structure of the plants and is deadly enough to kill<br/>\ninsects.  We are being told that these foods are safe for human<br/>\nconsumption, but we have heard that before about DDT, EDB and many other<br/>\npesticides later shown to be cancer-causing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not want to eat genetically engineered foods that contain the Bt<br/>\ntoxin.  Nor do I want to eat &quot;Roundup Ready&quot; soybeans or other future<br/>\nproducts such as tomatoes that contain the gene from a fish!  But without<br/>\nlabeling, I cannot avoid it.  So I am asking you to become a co-sponsor of<br/>\n(H.R. 3377 or S. 2080), the Genetically Engineered Food Right to Know Act,<br/>\nwhich will require the labeling of all genetically engineered foods. <br/>\nSimilar labeling legislation has already been passed in Europe, Australia<br/>\nand Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease write back to me and let me know if you intend to support this<br/>\nimportant legislation.  Your decision in this matter is likely to influence<br/>\nmy vote in the November 2000 election.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\n(signature)<br/>\n<br/>\n(print name)<br/>\n<br/>\n(address)<br/>\n<br/>\n(city, state, zip)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12134,"nextTopicId":12144}}
