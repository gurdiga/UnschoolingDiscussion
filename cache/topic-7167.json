I mean,  if he&#39;s able to maintain his clothes ok,  he could <br/>\nput them on when he dresses.  If not,  he sets out the clothes,  <br/>\nsocks,  shoes, whatever,  so that changing will be very quick.<br/>\n  And maybe he could gather any other needed supplies and get them in <br/>\nthe van *way early*...so that he mostly just needs to walk out at the <br/>\nappropriate time.<br/>\n    Of course,  this is more a suggestion of something to discuss <br/>\nwith Zach to see if he wants to try it this way with your reminders, <br/>\netc.<br/>\n   My oldest agreed to do this for things and it&#39;s helped us quite a <br/>\nbit.  If we need to go somewhere in the early morning,  she sets up <br/>\nher &#39;stuff&#39; the night before.<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"MorelFam@aol.com","from":"MorelFam@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"TqzUhQg8n9pUOeGych8OZEcW4pKWKzZYPMRwnSYpUu_E2inMgsLIptBuN7w8Lykj2pCHLQYuyQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"parenting","postDate":"953105010","msgId":7167,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM2LjJhMDIxYTEuMjYwMDk0NzJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31826,"prevInTime":7166,"nextInTime":7168,"topicId":7167,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/14/00 2:34:34 AM, Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-497343242\">In a message dated 3/14/00 2:34:34 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; you have to be equally<br/>\n<br/>\ncompassionate and understanding with yourself as you are with your kids<br/>\n<br/>\n- don&#39;t hold either up to a standard of &#39;the right way to be&#39; just<br/>\n<br/>\ndesire honesty and contentment.   the more you accept the way things are<br/>\n<br/>\n-without harsh judgment, and the more you have a clear idea of what you<br/>\n<br/>\nwant then just live your life, the more you are able to behave in a way<br/>\n<br/>\nthat feels natural and promotes happiness in everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>susan,<br/>\ni find this to be true, too. and am glad you brought it up again.  being <br/>\naccepting of where we are is not only salve for the soul, it is also a good <br/>\nexample for the kids.  i believe that the overall attempts with my kids are <br/>\nvery valuable and that individual screwups by me are not the most important <br/>\nthing.  and the kids are certainly going to be familiar with humaness and <br/>\npersistance if i just keep trying.  sometimes though, i feel apathetic and <br/>\noverwhelmed when i havent had enough positive reactions (from myself toward <br/>\nthem!)  but just today i had several of those wonderful moments that i cling <br/>\nto with my little ones, and those will see me through more days of mistakes <br/>\nand give me patience for the challenges i struggle with in parenting.  making <br/>\nthe most of the positive things gives me fuel for the stretches where my <br/>\npatience is thin and negativity abounds.  now, when i see what i am writing, <br/>\nit validates me that i am under a burden (for me) and i do need to credit <br/>\nmyself for hanging in.  i feel like i am headed back into the trenches as i <br/>\nwill have a newborn, two yr old, 4yo (boys) and 8 & 10yo girls this summer.  <br/>\nand the pregnancy might be putting demands on me that make my resources have <br/>\nless depth than i&#39;d like.  not complaining, just trying to affirm why i seem <br/>\nto be grasping for some even parenting patience lately!
