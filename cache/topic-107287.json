I wouldn&#39;t begin to say to a grown <br/>\nfriend or my husband, &quot;How did that make you feel?   Now tell the grocery store <br/>\nclerk how that made you feel.&quot;   And just imagine if someone said &quot;How does it <br/>\nmake you feel when the security guard/policeman asked you to step to the side?  <br/>\n Now tell the officer how you felt.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=i&#39;ve never seen the one who&#39;s hurting<br/>\nnot WANT to do this-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen kids more afraid of the other person than of the mom, but afraid <br/>\nnonetheless, and not feeling empowered to say, &quot;No, not only do I not want to <br/>\nrepeat what I just said in front of the other person, but I don&#39;t like the <br/>\nbabytalk either.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-the next thing i would do, if it wasn&#39;t already addressed, is ask him<br/>\nwhat he needs from<br/>\nzoe&#39;s mom to make him feel better.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been in these scenes as the subject and the other kid (when it was done <br/>\nwith/to kids, and I have never had as much respect for the manager of the <br/>\nscenario afterward.   It&#39;s not natural human behavior, and it doesn&#39;t help the <br/>\nchild figure out what he might do if the parent isn&#39;t there to orchestrate the <br/>\nhorribly awkward &quot;solution,&quot; which I think is worse than the problem. <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-it&#39;s usually an apology or a hug<br/>\nand sometimes it&#39;s<br/>\nnothing-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say nothing if I were pressed to request what would make me feel <br/>\nbetter.   What would make me feel better in any of those situations would be to <br/>\nexpress myself in private and either figure out on my own or with advice how I <br/>\nmight want to respond the next time such an occasion arises, if ever.    I <br/>\nwould not feel better having someone puppet-master a fake solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mom who did this the biggest and worst and most sing-songy in my life was <br/>\none whose son involved two of my kids in sexual misconduct, both younger than <br/>\nhe was.    When she found out about it she made totally lame-ass excuses and <br/>\noffered to pay for counselling.  Yeah, like a one year old girl needs <br/>\ncounselling.   With no one there to tell her what would be good to say, she didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave a clue, but she was great at telling her son how to act and what to say.   <br/>\nIn the absence of parental scripting and prompting, he wasn&#39;t making very good <br/>\ndecisions on his own at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-probably the most important thing is to let him use his voice,<br/>\nthere&#39;s nothing more<br/>\npowerful than that :)-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe freedom to choose not to use his voice might be just as important, or the <br/>\nleeway to decide when and how.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107196,"nextTopicId":107311}}
