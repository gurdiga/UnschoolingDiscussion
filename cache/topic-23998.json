My parents and all my <br/>\ngrandparents were rural Texans.  I grew up in northern New Mexico (where all <br/>\nthe bears are coming into people&#39;s yards and kitchens this season).  Both my <br/>\nparents hunted every year and we ate the meat.  They were hunter safety <br/>\ninstructors for kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never had a personal interest in guns, but I also *know* (not kinda think) <br/>\nthat playing with guns does not make a child violent.  In fact (not theory) <br/>\nit is my direct and long experience that the most acting out and desperate <br/>\nkid behavior seems to come from being ignored by parents or over-controlled <br/>\nby them.  Kids whose parents tell them everything to do and how and when tend <br/>\nto do and be all those forbidden things when thd parents aren&#39;t around.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nseen it repeatedly in schools, with friends and relatives, in large-kid <br/>\ngatherings and small overnighters.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if I were of several generations of Jewish parentage and <br/>\nlived in an apartment in Manhattan, I am assured by my friend Jack Goldman <br/>\nthat I would HATE guns and totally forbid anything like a gun.   (And when <br/>\nJack moved to Arizona as soon as he could, and bought a handgun and learned <br/>\nto shoot it, that could have been a good secret if he 1) hadn&#39;t left the <br/>\nreceipt in his backpack when he visited his mom and 2) if his mom hadn&#39;t been <br/>\nsuch that she went through the backpack of a son who was about 24 and had <br/>\njust finished a Master&#39;s Degree in physics.   So she flipped out over a <br/>\nreceipt for a gun.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were a German-surnamed Lutheran whose ancestors had been in Philadelphia <br/>\nfor three hundred years and my mom lived next door, I would be unlikely to <br/>\nbuy my son a cowboy outfit and cap pistols.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne size doesn&#39;t fit all in the U.S.; one U.S. size doesn&#39;t fit Canada, <br/>\nEngland, South Africa, Japan or Australia [are there others on this list? :-) <br/>\n ]<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the idea that forbidding something makes it disappear from the outside <br/>\nworld or forbidding something banishes it from our child&#39;s thoughts and <br/>\nawareness is an invalid idea.  Something totally forbidden becomes a major <br/>\nfactor in a child&#39;s life.  Families who ban any mention of evolution and who <br/>\nare derisive of any &quot;idiot&quot; who could possibly think it had validity are <br/>\nraising kids much more likely to read Darwin than kids who were presented <br/>\nthat as something lots of people believe and creationism as something lots of <br/>\nChristians believe because of the Bible.  And when the kids are exposed to it <br/>\nand might not think one would have to be an idiot to see the potential and <br/>\nthe evidence, their faith in their parents is going to erode a little bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a world of difference out there.  At one end might be a paranoid <br/>\nfamily that bases their choice of housing, car and fence wire on a paranoid <br/>\nfear of the government teaching all their children to recognize uniforms of <br/>\ndifferent law enforcement agencies, teaching their children what their rights <br/>\nare about letting FBI agents on the land or in the house, and then teaches <br/>\nthem to shoot guns and makes them keep loaded guns by each door.  <br/>\n(Undoubtedly they&#39;re homeschoolers.)  At the other end of the <br/>\nkid-has-touched-a-gun scale is a kid like mine, who has a thrift store cap <br/>\npistol, somewhere; a pirate pistol from Disneyland; a kinda star-trek <br/>\nphaser-like noise-box, a super soaker (broken), and no fascination with guns.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there seem to be some families who forbid guns altogether and don&#39;t <br/>\ndistinguish between the two examples above.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles\">http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDodd\">http://expage.com/SandraDodd</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23990,"nextTopicId":16065}}
