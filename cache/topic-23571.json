My <br/>\ndaughter loves her brightly colored construction paper, cheap sponges, etc. <br/>\nFor her she&#39;s happiest right now having a large variety of items to <br/>\nexperiment with. She loves being able to cut up the sponges into various <br/>\nshapes, or no shapes at all, sometimes she&#39;ll just cut them up or shred them <br/>\nand use them that way. Sometimes the construction paper is used only to cut <br/>\nat. She&#39;s having fun cutting and she doesn&#39;t care about what she&#39;s making, <br/>\nbut is facinated with how the scissors work. My kids are all under 7 years <br/>\nold and love to experiment with textures, colors, and variety right now. They <br/>\nabsolutely love our visits to the dollar stores so they can find something <br/>\nnew they can do art with. The expensive &quot;nice&quot; art supplies aren&#39;t what they <br/>\nneed and/or want at this time. They have never asked me about having &quot;nicer&quot; <br/>\nsupplies. Their thrilled with what they have now. However, if the day should <br/>\never come that they ask for nice brushes, acrylic paints, nice paper, <br/>\ncharcol, etc, it will be provided to them. Right now they ask for crayola, <br/>\nsponges, colorful papers, design cutting scissors and coloring books. You <br/>\ndon&#39;t need fancy expensive supplies to tell your child that their art is <br/>\nimportant to you.
