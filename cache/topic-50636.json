It&#39;s only $6, and well worth it.  There are some cool<br/>\nideas in it, and most of them are edible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the recipe from it for cinnamon applesauce dough which can&#39;t be<br/>\neaten but makes wonderful smelling ornaments.<br/>\n<br/>\n1 c. smooth applesauce (she says storebought works best)<br/>\n1/2 c. cinnamon<br/>\n1/2 c. flour<br/>\n1/2 t. salt.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMix all.  Roll out on waxed paper WITHOUT flour (it won&#39;t mix in and will<br/>\nshow).  She suggests patting dough to about 1/2 inch thick with hands, then<br/>\nrolling to 1/4 inch thick with clean rolling pin.  Use cookie cutters to cut<br/>\nshapes from the dough and place on pans lined with aluminum foil.  Make a<br/>\nhole in the top with a drinking straw before baking.<br/>\n<br/>\nBake for 2 hours at 225 degrees.  Remove from oven and let cool on the sheet<br/>\nfor 2 minutes, then use spatula to move to a cooling rack to cool entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut buy the book!  It&#39;s so worth it!<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the paint:  &quot;Feed Me! I&#39;m Yours&quot; says that you can dye salt dough with<br/>\nfood coloring, or paint it with plastic or acrylic based paints or markers.<br/>\nIf you use any other paint, spray with shellac type stuff or paint with<br/>\nclear nailpolish to preserve colors.  This book is by Vicki Lansky and might<br/>\nbe out of print (mine is ancient, from a thrift store), but it has about 10<br/>\nrecipes for playdough, clay, and dough ornaments that can be baked, dried,<br/>\netc.  Maybe your library has it.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":123374705,"authorName":"ejcrewe@aol.com","from":"ejcrewe@...","profile":"ejcrewe2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] dough ornaments","postDate":"1038117767","msgId":50686,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDljLjI5ZDcwZDMzLjJiMTFjNTg3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":50641,"nextInTopic":50734,"prevInTime":50685,"nextInTime":50687,"topicId":50636,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Wende - Thanks for de-lurking to help out with recipes.

The first one is traditional<br/>\ndough recipe:<br/>\n        Stir 4 C flour and 1 C salt in large bowl till well mixed. Stir<br/>\nin 1.5 C warm water. Add paste food color or tempera powder if desired.<br/>\nPut dough on lightly floured surface, and shape into a ball, using<br/>\nfloured hands. Knead dough 5 to 10 minutes or until dough is smooth and<br/>\nelastic. Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap, and take out only as much as<br/>\nyou need at a time. (It dries out quickly) Make your shapes and put them<br/>\non ungreased cookie sheet. Bake about 1 hour or until dough is dry and<br/>\njust begins to brown. Take shapes off cookie sheet and cool completely.<br/>\nPaint shapes with tempera paint or watercolors, if you like. If you spray<br/>\nthem with clear sealing spray they will last longer. Store unbaked dough<br/>\nin fridge for up to 30 days.<br/>\nMy children made ornaments with this recipe and their aunts and grandmas<br/>\nreally liked them:<br/>\nMix equal parts applesauce,  cinnamon, and white glue. You can add a<br/>\nlittle red food coloring to make them a deeper red. Roll out to about 1/4<br/>\ninch thick and use cookie cutters to cut out shapes. Use toothpick or<br/>\nstraw to make hole at top. You can either let them air dry, or to hasten<br/>\nthe process,  put them in a food dehydrator.    They smell great, and<br/>\nalso make cute gifts if you mix them with some potpourri and put them<br/>\naround a candle.<br/>\nThere is also a great book called Creating Art with Bread Dough by Dona<br/>\nMeilach that has a ton of pictures and ideas for the skilled and<br/>\nnot-so-skilled artists. Hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nWende (a newbie lurker)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does anyone have a good recipe for this?
