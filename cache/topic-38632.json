And I asked how i would know he would<br/>\nbe more<br/>\n| responsible.  He replied that he thought showing the other kids<br/>\nin<br/>\n| the neighborhood that he was so brave he didn&#39;t stop at stop<br/>\nsigns<br/>\n| would make them like him,  but instead they called him stupid<br/>\nand<br/>\n| laughed at him because he didn&#39;t have a bike so he guessed<br/>\nrunning<br/>\n| stop signs didn&#39;t make the kids like him.  So in the almost two<br/>\ndays<br/>\n| since his bike was taken away  Bunky has gone from crying and<br/>\ntelling<br/>\n| me how terrible I am to articulating why he did what he did<br/>\nand why<br/>\n| it was wrong--and even if it was wrong because the older boy<br/>\nsaid it<br/>\n| was stupid  instead of because he could have been killed<br/>\natleast he<br/>\n| has told me he will stop at stop signs  in the future  so he<br/>\nnow has<br/>\n| his bike back.   My sons greastest concerns in life is marrying<br/>\nBill<br/>\n| Gates daughter so he never has to work  and impressing older<br/>\nkids.<br/>\n| If he can&#39;t be the biggest, bravest, most impressive  loudest<br/>\ngas<br/>\n| passer  etc  he does anything that will gain him this status<br/>\nand<br/>\n| anything that takes away from that status causes him great<br/>\ndistress.<br/>\n| He has his hair dyed different colors atlest once a year,<br/>\nchanges his<br/>\n| name  anything to impress other kids.   The worst part is that<br/>\nother<br/>\n| kids don&#39;t like my son because my son always has to be the best<br/>\nor<br/>\n| bravest etc  or else he  (in the words of the boys he is always<br/>\n| trying to impress) &quot;acts like a baby&quot;      And I don&#39;t know how<br/>\nto<br/>\n| let my son know that.   Talking doesn&#39;t work because I am old<br/>\nand<br/>\n| don&#39;t know anything.  He does act like a perfect child infront<br/>\nof<br/>\n| people he doesn&#39;t know well.   His attitude is that of what<br/>\nmany<br/>\n| people consider that of a teenager  and he has been like this<br/>\nsince<br/>\n| he was 3 or 4.    My other son isn&#39;t like this  and another<br/>\nchild<br/>\n| that lived with me for the first 3 years isn&#39;t like this.   But<br/>\nthe<br/>\n| punishment of the taunting of the neighborhood boys (which i<br/>\ndidn&#39;t<br/>\n| enjoy but i knew would probably work)  worked and I trust him<br/>\nto be<br/>\n| able to use his bike responsibly  so he has it back.<br/>\n|<br/>\n|<br/>\n| ------------------------ Yahoo!
