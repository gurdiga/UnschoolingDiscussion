And, if I had my<br/>\n&gt; children at work, I certainly wouldn&#39;t berate them in front of all my<br/>\n&gt; employees, either&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Since I have never heard the tape, and probably never will, I won&#39;t say that<br/>\nshe never said that.  You do need to be careful about listening to patial<br/>\ntape recordings, especially when produced by people who don&#39;t like the one<br/>\n&quot;caught&quot; on tape.  I will say that the comment sounds highly out of<br/>\ncharacter for Dr. Laura.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not trying to jump to her defense here, I don&#39;t like all that she says<br/>\nor believes in either, but it sounds t me like some of you are tarring and<br/>\nfeathering her because you don&#39;t like her views.  What happened to &quot;don&#39;t be<br/>\njudgemental&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nDr. Laura is an observant Jew, so it stands to reason that she would call<br/>\nhomosexuality a sin.  She believes in the Old Testament, and homosexuality<br/>\nis called a sin there.  I have never heard her condemn homosexuals, just the<br/>\nbehavior.  I have heard her support adoption rights for homosexual couples,<br/>\nso I have difficulty believing that she hates all homosexuals.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of you have condemned her for &quot;not living what she preaches&quot; because<br/>\nshe is not at home with her son, and instead works.  Her son goes to school,<br/>\nand she works during the hours he is in school only.  Her husband is a full<br/>\ntime parent for their son.  Why on earth would you condemn her for this?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She&#39;s also a religous bigot.  Oh, and did I mention an expert on all<br/>\n&gt; religions that she has never heard of.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have never heard her be a religious bigot.  She is open about her own<br/>\nreligious choice, and the journey that brought her there, but I haven&#39;t<br/>\nheard her demean any other religion.  Have you?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10116,"nextTopicId":10048}}
