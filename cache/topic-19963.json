With our kids, their allowance or pay (whatever <br/>\nwe&#39;re calling it and however we&#39;re figuring it at any given point) is so low <br/>\ncompared to almost everyone we know (only $6 a week for each of the three <br/>\nolder ones) and yet they never seem to be short on money because it seems <br/>\nlike there&#39;s not much they spend it on.  Justin, my almost 17 yr old, is very <br/>\nseriously into music so he is getting to the point where he&#39;d like more.  But <br/>\nhe has a good acoustic guitar that we got him for his birthday last year (or <br/>\nhalf got him...we kicked in about $200 and he kicked in about $150) and he <br/>\nplays it about 3 or 4 hours a day.  And he&#39;s getting an electric guitar for <br/>\nhis upcoming birthday with the amp, which he put in all he had for and we <br/>\nsupplied the rest.  Jonathan and Kevin (my soon to be 13 yr olds) can hardly <br/>\never think of anything they care to spend their money on so they have about <br/>\n$100 each right now.  Also, they do all get money for birthdays and Christmas <br/>\nfrom relatives and from us.<br/>\n     I find that unschooling and living out in the boondocks have brought <br/>\nabout this with our kids.  They like getting stuff from garage sales as much <br/>\nas I do so we hardly spend anything on clothes anymore.  We do all love books <br/>\nso some money goes to that when we can&#39;t find something at a garage sale or <br/>\nlibrary.  Kevin loves Civil War history so he has spent money on books about <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n     I feel kind of embarrassed sometimes telling people how low their <br/>\nallowances are but with the size of our family and our own attempts to get <br/>\nMatt (my husband) out of the rat race as much as possible by working less, we <br/>\njust can&#39;t afford to give them much more.  I am thankful that the kids don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel deprived by it.  I do want them to value time more than money, overall.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Lucy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Nanci Kuykendall &lt;aisliin@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"gkABRPtdnEWSJOoda-9lMBPPiGGeme6ZhLfEhOL0Gwm_Wt9QOMkQrFfuN0k6scgaU5GDsYpseNnAUNXo5sp-B3TOXpEU01p25Wjb","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[Unschooling-dotcom] Twisted Logic???","postDate":"988426364","msgId":19963,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwNDI4MDI1MjQ0LjE5NzUucW1haWxAd2ViMTM3MDgubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDk4ODQxNTU4OC4yMDU4LjMzODgxLmwxMEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":20090,"prevInTime":19962,"nextInTime":19964,"topicId":19963,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My feeling is that these things<br/>\nneed to be learned as a basic life skills kind of<br/>\nthing.  Allowance is nice, because it keeps a kid<br/>\nhaving to beg for every penny, which is demeaning and<br/>\nfrustrating.  For those extra funds they may want,<br/>\nextra work is good.  Waxing the car, home repairs or<br/>\nimprovements, doing someone else&#39;s regular chores for<br/>\nthem, or babysitting siblings might all be good<br/>\nexamples of extra work, above and beyond normally<br/>\nexpected chores.  Another option is to compromise by<br/>\nloaning the child the money, matching their funds with<br/>\nyours, or other financial arrangements.  After all,<br/>\nloans, grants and financial contracts are common in<br/>\nadult life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe child does not have to stop at home when looking<br/>\nfor extra funds.  They can go into business for<br/>\nthemselves walking dogs, delivering papers, weeding<br/>\ngardens, washing cars, and all the various other tasks<br/>\nthat kids have long hired themselves out for.  I think<br/>\nencouraging problem solving and enterprise is a good<br/>\nthing.  If money is what they want, I do not want them<br/>\nto learn that it all flows from me and dad, as it most<br/>\ncertainly does not.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
