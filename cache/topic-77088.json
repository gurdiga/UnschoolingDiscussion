I too went back to my post and don&#39;t seem to see <br/>\nwhere I sounded superior or now hypocritical as you&#39;ve said above. I did not push <br/>\nthe conversation into debate about personal style. Jeva questioned why the <br/>\ndiscussions turn to arguments and why things are delivered in ways we wouldn&#39;t <br/>\ntreat our children. I was making a point to Jeva, that these same stagnant <br/>\ndebates happen regularly here and sometimes it just isn&#39;t worth getting worked up <br/>\nabout. I was also qualifying what she said because many people do post <br/>\nprivately when their voices are not heard or they fear coming out of lurkdom to post. <br/>\nFor me, I have learned to seriously reflect as to how much energy I want to <br/>\nuse where all e-lists are concerned. Sometimes when I sit back and wait a while <br/>\nI see people clarify themselves and then I am glad I didn&#39;t jump the gun. <br/>\nThere are times no one posts any arguments and we all just get along and discuss <br/>\nthings rather than argue. Then there are times like these where neither party <br/>\nis hearing the other. I&#39;m not defending Chris (Oom) nor am I offending her. My <br/>\npoint was simply that it makes me sad that the ways to be better get lost <br/>\nwhile people try to one up each other.
