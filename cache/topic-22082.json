How to teach them spelling,<br/>\n&gt; vocabulary, phonograms to help them read.  Are there &quot;tools&quot; you do<br/>\n&gt; use to help them learn?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all my opinion...but it&#39;s also based on personal experience.  We<br/>\nhave a 12 yr old son and have homeschooled him all along.  We also have a 23<br/>\nyr old son who we removed from the ps system in the middle of his 8th grade<br/>\nyear.<br/>\n<br/>\nInitially we followed a typical school program, only did it at home.  We<br/>\nused weekly field trips as our reward for accomplishing something for the<br/>\nweek.  That may work for some, but it did NOT work well for us!  You would<br/>\nnot believe the fights and struggles to get a teenager to do his homework.<br/>\nEventually I gave up out of desperation and for several years considered<br/>\nmyself a failure as a mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I stepped back and looked at what DS was doing.  For starters he was<br/>\nreading constantly.  He was also heavily involved in video games.  We<br/>\nrestrict what type of games are allowed in our home, but there are not many<br/>\nrestrictions on how much they are played.  Once the game is mastered, the<br/>\nkid wants to move on to something else.  Just like reading a book.  The book<br/>\nis finished, you revel in how it all went and then look for something else<br/>\nto do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this boy refused to take his GED when I thought he should.  Then he<br/>\nneeded it for the type of work he decided he wanted to do (electrician), so<br/>\nhe signed up for the test.  I kept after him to study...with NO luck, of<br/>\ncourse!  The day of the test arrives, he takes it and we wait for the<br/>\nresults.  Now, I&#39;m certain he is going to fail because we have not done<br/>\nanything academic for several years.  The stinker passed the test with<br/>\nflying colors the first time!  I hate it when the kid shows me how wrong I<br/>\nwas.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n Do you limit their TV/computer game time?  Do<br/>\n&gt; you go to the library a lot?  I guess I&#39;m just having trouble<br/>\n&gt; imagineing my kids initiating a &quot;learning experience&quot;!  Does<br/>\n&gt; unschooling put them behind academically?  I mean, you want them to be<br/>\n&gt; able to basic adding and subtracting by a certain age and then<br/>\n&gt; multiplying and dividing by another age, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nWith DS #2 (age 12 now), we have been relaxed about our schooling all along.<br/>\nI wish I could say I was wise enough to realize he&#39;d learn from life, but<br/>\nthe reality is that my health problems keep me from pursuing a formal<br/>\nacademic education.  I never know from one day (hour really!) to the next<br/>\nhow I&#39;m going to be feeling.  So, year after year we just don&#39;t &#39;get around&#39;<br/>\nto much formal education.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe results?  He&#39;s reading at a college level.  Isn&#39;t at all interested in<br/>\nyouth books (with the exception of Harry Potter, but DH and I love them,<br/>\ntoo), but devours adult books.  We are often reading the same series as a<br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath?  He was doing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division<br/>\nbefore he was 6.  For quite a while he had to figure the answer out rather<br/>\nthan having it memorized, but that tells me he knows how to use his brain to<br/>\nthink things through.  Plus, I firmly believe that if someone has to work<br/>\nfor the answer they will always remember it!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne &#39;difficulty&#39; we had is friends and relatives quizzing him.  What&#39;s 2X2?<br/>\nHow do you spell....?  That sort of thing.  This gave DS some frustration<br/>\nfor a while because he didn&#39;t know the answer as fast as the friend/relative<br/>\nthought he should.  What we were eventually able to show him is that he knew<br/>\nthe answer or how to find it, but the friend/relative had used a different<br/>\nlanguage to ask the question.  For instance if they had asked him what is 2<br/>\ntwo&#39;s, he&#39;d have known.  I still get busy body relatives wanting to give me<br/>\nteaching aids so I can bring him up to grade level.  But it only takes a<br/>\nlittle real interaction with him to know he&#39;s doing just fine.  IMO knowing<br/>\nhow to find the answer and being willing to make the effort is at least as<br/>\nimportant as having answers already memorized.  Maybe more important.  Most<br/>\nof life doesn&#39;t come with packaged answers.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;ve strayed from the question!  Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I care what age he reads, writes or multiplies?  Heck no!  It will come<br/>\nwhen he&#39;s ready or has a need for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example...recently he accepted a challenge from his sunday school teacher<br/>\nto read his scriptures every day and write his thoughts in a journal.  At<br/>\nfirst he was having a very difficult time with the writing and felt his<br/>\nskills were low.  But because it was important to him, he kept at it day<br/>\nafter day.  This was a goal he accepted.  I refuse to nag him about it.<br/>\nIt&#39;s his goal, it&#39;s his responsibility.  I will encourage him.  Tell him<br/>\ngood job for accomplishing his goal.  Maybe even brag about how well he is<br/>\nkeeping to a goal he chose.  I will help him spell and I even delay bedtime<br/>\nwhen I&#39;m tired so he can finish the task he has set for himself.  (There are<br/>\nlimits to this...I have legitimate needs, too, and sleep is one of them!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, almost 6 months later, he&#39;s still reading and writing daily and has<br/>\nnot missed a single day!  His writing skills have improved simply because he<br/>\npracticed.  His spelling skills have also improved because of practice.  In<br/>\nthe beginning I had to help him figure out how to spell a LOT of words each<br/>\nday.  Now we go for days without his asking me how to spell something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t imagine what a struggle it would have been for both of us if I tried<br/>\nto impose a goal I had created on him.  I&#39;ve been there, done that with the<br/>\noldest son.  It was not fun and he still did just fine in spite of my<br/>\ninterferance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith spelling, I ask DS  how he thinks it&#39;s spelled.  He usually can spell<br/>\nit like it sounds, which means I can read what he&#39;s written.  Since the<br/>\nprimary purpose of writing is either to help the writer remember something<br/>\nor to communicate a thought to another, he meets the need either way.  So, I<br/>\nhave him write it out and then I read it out loud to him, showing him that I<br/>\ncan read it.  This has built his confidence in his abilities.  With<br/>\nconfidence he had the nerve to try more and harder words.  Since he reads so<br/>\nmuch, he now will see a word and recognize it&#39;s not right.  So, he tries<br/>\nagain until he&#39;s satisfied or decides it&#39;s not that important for that word<br/>\nat this time.  It is working well for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoral of this long story is trust yourself and trust your children.  If it<br/>\nfeels good for your family, follow that path.  I&#39;m firmly convinced that no<br/>\none is able to truly be lazy.  It is human nature to be doing something!<br/>\nBoredom is a signal of the need to engage in some activity.  Left to their<br/>\nown devices every one will find something to do.  It may look like not much,<br/>\nbut they will be doing something.  Expose your children to the life.  Don&#39;t<br/>\nbe afraid to include things that are important to you.  They&#39;ll become<br/>\ninvolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes down to it, who cares whether they learned to multiply when<br/>\nthey were 8 or 30?!  For that matter, many people use a calculator.  If they<br/>\nnever learned to multiply it wouldn&#39;t be the end of the world.  It might be<br/>\ninconvenient, but it wouldn&#39;t be the end of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy (lengthy) 2 cents worth,<br/>\nEiraul </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"LisaBugg","from":"&quot;LisaBugg&quot; &lt;LisaBugg@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"i2U9f98T_ritOMkUbQ4qvYbblEkVoyHkdWf0v-_80pDBrvxfY4jfP96IxQ_muEfqyLVC1WMSHo3L6uWxSmpakR69tdXj9GLclQc8YQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] making everyday life school","postDate":"991090921","msgId":22101,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNzMwMWMwZTdkMyRmOTY1ZmJlMCQ0NjFjOTNhOEBpZm5ldC5lZHU+","referencesHeader":"PDlldGo1MCs4OHU2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22099,"nextInTopic":22105,"prevInTime":22100,"nextInTime":22102,"topicId":22082,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

For the most part textbooks are horrible<br/>\npieces of writing .  Why buy substandard books when the library is usually<br/>\nfull of good books?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Which brings me to another question.  How to teach them spelling,<br/>\n&gt; vocabulary, phonograms to help them read.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The focus shifts from teaching to learning.  A better question is how will<br/>\nthey learn?<br/>\n<br/>\n Are there &quot;tools&quot; you do<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; use to help them learn?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Everything is a tool.  The sewing machine, the night&#39;s sky, the library, the<br/>\nice cream machine, antique stores.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you limit their TV/computer game time?<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not.  At times I have limited TV because I offered other, more<br/>\nwonderful things to do and I offered them just to break our TV habit.... but<br/>\nthat&#39;s happened 3 times in the last 12 years or so.  I have also offered<br/>\nvideos and games in order to break the fast pace always going habit that<br/>\nwe&#39;ve fallen into a couple of times.<br/>\n<br/>\n Do<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you go to the library a lot?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We do not, but that&#39;s because my personal book habit rivals the gross<br/>\nnational product. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m just having trouble<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; imagineing my kids initiating a &quot;learning experience&quot;!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What is a learning experience?  Is sking a question a learning experience?<br/>\nYour children never ask questions?  Your children never ask to go places?<br/>\nYour children never watch a TV show and discuss it?  All of those are<br/>\nlearning experiences.  Your kids have initated millions of them since the<br/>\nday they were born.  You will need to stand back though and watch for a<br/>\nwhile in order to see more clearly.  Our society says only certain kinds of<br/>\nquestions posed in certain kinds of ways is *school* and therefore<br/>\nsanctioned.  This, of course, is bunk, but it takes awhile to see through<br/>\nthe cage.<br/>\n<br/>\n Does<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; unschooling put them behind academically?

I&#39;m a 40 year old wife, mother of 4, former paratrooper, former<br/>\nmidwife, current website manager, writer of 4 articles.  Am I behind other<br/>\n40 year olds?  Am I ahead?  Which piece of knowledge makes me *smart*?   I<br/>\nknow how to palpitate a pregnant woman&#39;s belly and find baby body parts.  Am<br/>\nI behind or ahead of a sonogram machine?  I know absolutely nothing about<br/>\nancient Chinese history. Couldn&#39;t spot a Ming vase in a museum. (well okay,<br/>\nif they had placards &lt;g&gt;)  Am I behind other 40 year olds?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a 9 year old with a vocabulary that regularly impresses others.  He&#39;s<br/>\na hoot to listen to. But he does not yet read fluently.  He&#39;s still at the<br/>\ndog/cat stage of the reading game.  Is he behind or ahead of others<br/>\nvocabulary wise, since most people assume you must read in order to broaden<br/>\nyour speaking vocabulary?  I have another child, a daughter, who is so fast<br/>\nwith mental math her 18 year old sister blushes when she asks for help.<br/>\nThis child cannot read at all.  Is she behind or ahead?  Matter of fact,<br/>\nthis 7 year old can work with multiplication and division while her<br/>\nsubtraction is a bit weak.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is really about that term *you want*.  I want my children to be<br/>\nhappy, kind, peaceful human beings. I want them to take a look at the whole<br/>\nworld and choose parts to dive deeply into. I want them to explore their<br/>\ngifts and capabilities, their interests and their fears. I don&#39;t want them<br/>\nto measure themselves as behind or ahead of another person, but would prefer<br/>\nthey walk beside others.. I want them to live joyously, laugh often, and<br/>\ntake care of themselves and the world.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Betsy Hill","from":"&quot;Betsy Hill&quot; &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"jNi4HLv0q_NWd5RJsBj0ojOG-QuiFZjpBXVoOlKwSv1REPxWJc9vBREERSGt9esxDJTsRsAFGzVYr0gdkPdZiDlqu2G-Xa7yS34OJfU","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] making everyday life school","postDate":"991070766","msgId":22086,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI3MzdDQTM5LTQwRTMxQDIwOS4xNzkuMjUwLjU4Pg=="},"prevInTopic":22085,"nextInTopic":22099,"prevInTime":22085,"nextInTime":22087,"topicId":22082,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I believe in letting kids take their time and learn<br/>\nthoroughly.  Learning too soon, for an individual child&#39;s level of<br/>\nreadiness, creates failure experiences that make learning harder.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know what follows is going to sound harsh, and I hope you will forgive<br/>\nme.  I&#39;m intending it to be eye-opening.  <br/>\n<br/>\nForcing kids to do lessons until they hate learning and shudder when one<br/>\noffers learning experiences is the most efficient way to put them &quot;behind&quot;<br/>\nin life.  It&#39;s a huge handicap to overcome.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think our society has some pretty warped ideas about education.

Look at how well they learn to speak. <br/>\nIt&#39;s a really complex job, and they do it without curriculum, just because<br/>\nthey desire to do it and their parents help them.  I think this is a great<br/>\nmodel for other kinds of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"lite2yu@aol.com","from":"lite2yu@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"mm1uM5LftE4dPuzPuCLU8OtxdQ-B1Yk9hlI5q2IHZ0JfdVmrhAJABU-BEDG50z5HXVMwzsjN","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] making everyday life school","postDate":"991060951","msgId":22085,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQyLjczM2E4MTkuMjg0M2JkZDdAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":22082,"nextInTopic":22086,"prevInTime":22084,"nextInTime":22086,"topicId":22082,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Molly, And welcome to the list.

I will attempt to answer a few of your questions <br/>\nwith what I believe and what holds true for our family, and I&#39;m sure there <br/>\nwill be lots of others who pipe in with their own feelings. One of the best <br/>\nthing about unschooling is that it evolves constantly according to how  you <br/>\nsee it and let it evolve and follow your instincts.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\nSo, if I understand unschooling (and I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t) it is basically<br/>\nmaking everyday things you do into a &quot;lesson&quot; without ever telling the<br/>\nchild?  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I would say no to this one. I don&#39;t keep anything from my children, <br/>\nand I don&#39;t try to &quot;make&quot; anything into a lesson. My daughter, Lelia just <br/>\ngets up every day and lives and follows her own interest, and I try to do the <br/>\nsame thing. The best &quot;teaching&quot; (and I use that term with a lot of caution) <br/>\nthat I can do is to be the best person I can be and do what interests me, and <br/>\nLelia will model that. <br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt; It&#39;s being open to what they are interested in at the moment?  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely YES! And try to stay out of the way as much as possible and be a <br/>\nfacilitator. . .a person who is there to give help when asked and only give <br/>\nthe help asked for.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Which brings me to another question.  How to teach them spelling, <br/>\nvocabulary, phonograms to help them read.  Are there &quot;tools&quot; you do <br/>\nuse to help them learn?

I <br/>\nhave no time tables for them . . . I know that just by living the best life <br/>\nthey live and doing what they love, they will learn what they need to learn. <br/>\nI don&#39;t teach them anything. Lelia is quite a fine writer just be being left <br/>\nto write what she finds meaningful to her. I don&#39;t buy into the concept of <br/>\n&quot;behind&quot;. I don&#39;t limit TV. . . she seems to limit it herself, and there are <br/>\ntimes she watches quite a bit, and times she watches nothing at all. We go to <br/>\nthe library almost every week.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor us, unschooling is more  a way of life than a way of school. . . my <br/>\nhusband and I have the most to unlearn and are working diligently at that. I <br/>\nsuspect because your mother does the homeschooling that this may be quite <br/>\ndifficult. I would tend to think she may need to be &quot;fired&quot; for lack of a <br/>\nbetter term if you decide that unschooling is what you choose. The message <br/>\nboard on this site are a good way to get more ideas. . .they may help you <br/>\nfigure out if this is what you are looking for.
