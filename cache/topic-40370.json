Last I looked, Helen was saying that in the subject of unschooling,<br/>\nhardly anything was Off Topic. I have long believed that it&#39;s important for<br/>\npeople to know that, deep down, the school system is out to eliminate us,<br/>\neven though there are some sympathetic people among its employees.<br/>\nThat&#39;s partly why I called our practice &quot;The Education Underground.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I have plenty of precedent for my feelings about the school system<br/>\nwe reject. I believe that many who enter the world of Homeschooling, do so<br/>\nwithout quite knowing why they do it. They know that they didn&#39;t get along<br/>\nin their child&#39;s school and they knew it wasn&#39;t educating their child, but<br/>\ncan&#39;t put their finger on what it was specifically that bothered them, even<br/>\nif the teachers seemed nice enough...<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a passage from John T.Gatto that might help some newbies who find<br/>\nthemselves in that catagory:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;As long as we&#39;re questioning public schooling, we should question whether<br/>\n </span></blockquote>there really is an abstraction called &quot;the public&quot; at all, except in the<br/>\nominour calculations of social engineers....I find the term [public]<br/>\ninsulting, a cartoon of social reality.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; If an institution that robs people of their right to self-determination can<br/>\n </span></blockquote>call itself &quot;public;&quot; if being &quot;public&quot; means it can turn families into<br/>\nagents of the state, making parents spy on and harass their sons and<br/>\ndaughters because a schoolteacher tells them to; if the state can steal your<br/>\nhome because you can&#39;t pay its &quot;public&quot; school taxes, and the state courst<br/>\ncan break up your family if you refust to allow the state to tell your<br/>\nchildren what to think, then the word &quot;public&quot; is garbage and for people who<br/>\nallow themselves to be treated like slaves. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m on your side.
