Explain to me how it could focus on an IS schooling<br/>\nmentality when Little Bear does not go to school and in fact spends his<br/>\ntime unschooling by wandering around playing in the woods, doing cooking<br/>\nexperiemnts at home, using his imagination and playing with his friends.<br/>\nThe only edpisode I have ever seen which even mentioned school was one in<br/>\nwhich his best freind Emily had to start attending school and so would be<br/>\ngone from the Forest until the following summer.  So Little Bear taught<br/>\nhimself to read and write (with a little help from Mother and Father Bear)<br/>\nat home so that he could send letters to her.  Anyhow, I was just curious<br/>\nwhat you found negative about it, since we all love it so much at our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4214,"nextTopicId":4220}}
