Most of <br/>\nthem <br/>\n&gt; were not at all violent, though some produced formidable warriors. <br/>\n&gt; They tended to exhibit more interpersonal respect in general than <br/>\n&gt; cultures that make &quot;exceptions&quot; to the &quot;whacking people is bad&quot; <br/>\nrule. <br/>\n&gt;  .women and elders, for instance, were generally valued as equal <br/>\n&gt; members of the society, despite the fact that they were by and <br/>\nlarge <br/>\n&gt; less equipped to be whackers than whackees.  When those that no <br/>\n&gt; longer exist ceased to do so, it was usually due to some external <br/>\n&gt; force.  The members of those cultures were capable of resolving <br/>\n&gt; conflicts without bloody revolutions or acts of terrorism, and <br/>\ntheir <br/>\n&gt; societies didn&#39;t rip themselves apart.  They weren&#39;t people who <br/>\nfelt <br/>\n&gt; that all power flows from the barrel of a gun (or the equivalent), <br/>\nin <br/>\n&gt; part because physical strength or its lack had never been held up <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt; them as the limiting factor in their rights.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you don&#39;t believe me, feel free to investigate for yourself. <br/>\n&gt; Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict, and Marija Gimbutas leap to mind as <br/>\n&gt; early researchers in the area, but there are more recent works you <br/>\n&gt; could look at.  Many extant Native American cultures view violence <br/>\nof <br/>\n&gt; any kind against children as deplorable, as do members of at least <br/>\n&gt; some Indian castes.  I&#39;m not positive, but I think the Quakers <br/>\nshare <br/>\n&gt; that opinion.  Perhaps you could do some reading or find a member <br/>\nof <br/>\n&gt; such a group to discuss things with.

We were sucked into the whole control your kids thing from <br/>\nthe day they were born.  It never did and never will work and it took <br/>\nme a few years, unfortunately, to figure out that they are people <br/>\nwith feelings like me.  It never felt right and I never felt like I <br/>\nwas helping them, only hurting.  I finally told my guys that I would <br/>\nnever hurt them again and that there is no excuse for violence and no <br/>\none EVER deserves to be hit or injured, no matter the offense. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn an earlier post, when I stated that something only &quot;spoils when <br/>\nleft to rot&quot;, I hope everyone knew I was refering to physical <br/>\naffection and attention, not discipline.<br/>\n<br/>\nambersand <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., athterath@H... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not interested in contributing to an off-topic war on this <br/>\nissue, <br/>\n&gt; but there is one thing noone ever mentions when it is raised on <br/>\n&gt; mailing lists, and which I believe is of significant importance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The argument is generally over whether hitting kids--in whatever <br/>\nway <br/>\n&gt; their parents have decided is acceptable--is &quot;good for them&quot;.  <br/>\nThose <br/>\n&gt; in favor of it often say or at least imply that it &quot;teaches them&quot; <br/>\n&gt; something or somehow builds their character in a way that no <br/>\n&gt; non-violent approach could.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The fact is that there are, and have been throughout recorded <br/>\n&gt; history, entire CULTURES that flourished in peace and plenty <br/>\nwithout <br/>\n&gt; anyone striking or otherwise dominating their children.
