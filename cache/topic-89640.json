Because we are agnostic.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been a Girl Scout leader for almost 3 years now.  I looked into a<br/>\nvariety of organizations before becoming a GS Leader, as my daughter really<br/>\nwanted to be in a club of some type.  Really check out all your options.<br/>\nThere is Roots & Shoots, 4H, Camp Fire Boys & Girls, and many others.  My<br/>\ndaughter didn&#39;t like any except Girl Scouts, but several were nice (and you<br/>\ncan always change!).   We are involved in an all age homeschooling group,<br/>\nplus we have lots of friends that we communicate with often.  Zoe never had<br/>\ntime to just be with a group of girls similar in age to herself and she<br/>\nwanted this time with no boys (her choice, but it limited the club choices).<br/>\nAfter trying out several troops, I quickly realized that the only way my<br/>\ndaughter could have the freedom that she needs was to become The main Leader<br/>\nof her troop.  So, I did the training, and here we are.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur troop currently has 4 regular girls (all homeschoolers).  2 just dropped<br/>\nout.  Our troop is very Unschooling friendly.  The girls plan the majority<br/>\nof the meetings (the ones that they don&#39;t plan, they &quot;plan&quot; to have me<br/>\nplan!), vote on outings (from a list of their collected ideas), really<br/>\neverything.  We haven&#39;t done anything as a troop that they majority of the<br/>\ngirls didn&#39;t want to do (and it is always an option for each girl that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like something to not do it).  As the Leader, it is my<br/>\nresponsibility to gather supplies, etc. in order to make sure that they get<br/>\nto do what they&#39;ve planned (e.g. gather paper and scissors if we are doing<br/>\norigami).  There are certain things that really are more fun to do with a<br/>\ngroup of kids, rather than alone.  We do those things.  We have meetings<br/>\nevery other week and usually two outings every month.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand about not liking cookie selling.  The official word on cookies<br/>\nis that you do NOT have to sell them.  You are encouraged to if you&#39;ve asked<br/>\nfor fee support (i.e. you couldn&#39;t afford to pay for the $10/year membership<br/>\nfee).  And, even then, you&#39;ve officially sold cookies if you sell ONE box.<br/>\nEven as a vegan (all the cookies are vegetarian, but none are vegan), my<br/>\ndaughter sells over 100 boxes to relatives and next door neighbors that come<br/>\nto us looking for someone to buy cookies from.  They all know that Zoe is a<br/>\nGirl Scout and they&#39;d rather buy from her than a cookie booth.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for religion, the Girl Scout organization is definitely NOT a Christian<br/>\norganization.  This confuses a lot of people, because the word &quot;God&quot; is in<br/>\nthe Girl Scout Promise and the girls are to learn the Promise.  The official<br/>\nstance (check out the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.girlscouts.org\">http://www.girlscouts.org</a> for more details) is that<br/>\nthe girls can say any word in replacement of the word &quot;God&quot; that they<br/>\nbelieve in.  There is one girl in our troop that says &quot;Nature&quot;, one that<br/>\nsays nothing, and the others say &quot;God&quot;.    There are, however, troops that<br/>\nare religiously based, but they are their own thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lisa in AZ<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cottrellbentley@...\">cottrellbentley@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Wanting opinions on scouts, camp, etc.","postDate":"1074720140","msgId":89661,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDEwZmEwMWMzZTA0YSRkNzBmMWYwMCRmZDAwYThjMEBKZW5ueT4="},"prevInTopic":89657,"nextInTopic":89662,"prevInTime":89660,"nextInTime":89662,"topicId":89640,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-565121181\">&lt;&lt;It can be or not, depending on the troop.

I have no<br/>\npersonal experience with it, just passing on the 411. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about 4H instead of scouting? One of the mothers in my local group runs<br/>\na 4H chapter (terminology?). It seems like the activities are very top down<br/>\nstructured � which is great if that is what you want. So far Jayn definitely<br/>\nlikes to be in charge of her own time and activities. I guess each chapter<br/>\nwill have totally different activities, partly depending on locality (very<br/>\nlittle animal husbandry in the urban group run locally) <br/>\n<br/>\nThinking back to my own meager experience as a Girl Guide (in Australia) and<br/>\nreading the �about us� links to some of these organizations, they are seem<br/>\nall about �teaching principles�. They seem structured basically like a<br/>\nclassroom, albeit a liberal one, with leaders (teachers) and very much<br/>\ndirected discussions. Aren�t we already living/modeling the principles that<br/>\nthese folks want to instill but without the external rewards (badges) or<br/>\nleader directed play? I feel like it will be redundant for Jayn.<br/>\n<br/>\n One part of Spiral Scouts was talking about parents and children having the<br/>\nopportunity to connect. I don�t think we have a need that they will fill<br/>\njust now. As a learning resource for spiritual or ecological issues, I�m not<br/>\nsure this kind of group would be our first �go to�. If there were no local<br/>\nhomeschool group for Jayn to meet new friends, then yes possibly. I suspect<br/>\nthat the personality of the various leaders would be key to the experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone want to read about my disastrous experience at Girl Guide camp? If so<br/>\nread on:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I went to camp, in ancient canvas teepee shaped tents, at the age of<br/>\n12, it was with many girls I had never seen before. Naturally I ended up in<br/>\nthe �screw-ups� group. After struggling for an extra long time to erect the<br/>\nthing, we failed to dig a trench around our tent (who knew?) so when it<br/>\npoured torrentially that afternoon much of our luggage got wet, and the<br/>\ninterior of our tent (no groundsheets provided) was muddy. We were supposed<br/>\nto gather sticks to make all kinds of fabulous furniture pieces including<br/>\nluggage racks, following the line drawings in our books, but ours were<br/>\nrickety to be charitable. Neither I, nor my clueless mother, had any notion<br/>\nof what was right to bring. I had regular bedding, not a sleeping bag, and<br/>\nno air mattress � I think I was the only girl without an air mattress. Since<br/>\nmy bedding was on the ground it was totally soaked. I was absolutely<br/>\nfreezing that night, and boy was the ground hard. My mother insisted,<br/>\nbecause of my age, that I take along a large package of (clearly marked)<br/>\nkotex pads, just in case I started menses during the trip. Thank goodness<br/>\nthat at least was spared me. However I was teased unmercifully for having<br/>\nthe package � so much for camaraderie and kindness. Of course the steak<br/>\ndesignated as mine was the one that fell on the ground � they didn�t tell me<br/>\nthat it had, until I was wondering aloud why it was gritty. We went on hikes<br/>\neach day. I was fat and not athletic. It was tiring. I wanted to sit down.<br/>\nOh there�s a nice mound. I�ll sit there for a moment. Ants� nest. Red ants.<br/>\nI want to go home. At least my bedding has dried, but the ground is still<br/>\nhard. I vaguely remember competitive activities like scavenger hunts and<br/>\ntrail following, which my tent was not shining at. I think I was not good at<br/>\nthat stuff � bugs scared me. I also remember feeling better when I finally<br/>\nhad the chance to wash my hair in the river, then sitting on a log and<br/>\ncombing it. It was long and in good condition, and the sun was finally out.<br/>\nI have never been camping since. One day my husband is going to take us � we<br/>\nare going to have a really, really high quality tent with all the zips and<br/>\nflaps, and aero beds � and bug repellant.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

It&#39;s very inclusive, lots <br/>\nof &quot;world&quot; type stuff (make the world a better place, get along with everyone <br/>\ntype stuff).  I was a leader for a while when my oldest (now 20) was in 1st <br/>\ngrade.  Not a bad organization, but I hated the whole cookie thing.  The troop <br/>\nbarely got anything...money went to the cookie company and girl scout <br/>\nhigher-ups.  I never felt that was right.  But they do have a lot of cool stuff to <br/>\nearn badges.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoyscouts, on the other hand, is a very Christian organization.  At least the <br/>\npack our boys were in (for a whole 9 months) was.  I signed them up thinking <br/>\n&quot;OK, 2 meetings per month, I can deal with that.&quot;  Ha ha ha ha ha.  THey all <br/>\nhave to be in different groups (by grade), so I was going at least twice a <br/>\nWEEK...plus fund raisers, pancake breakfasts, community service work, <br/>\ncampouts,...it consumes your life!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have happily settled on 4H.  Our meetings are twice a month, all the kids <br/>\nare in the same group (no division by grades), the camps are great, everything <br/>\nis cheap, no uniforms to deal with, fundraisers are stuff like carwashes or <br/>\nbake sales (our group is a dance group so we get paid for dancing at festivals <br/>\nand such).  It is not just a farm club...there are probably around 200 <br/>\ndifferent projects to choose from...anything from small motors, to computers, to <br/>\nanimals, to cooking, to artwork.  Plus they can enter their projects in the local <br/>\nfairs, everyone gets a ribbon...I can&#39;t say enough good about it.  We&#39;re <br/>\nreally happy with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing..when I was little we were in Campfire Girls.  (I believe it&#39;s <br/>\nnow Campfire Boys and Girls) and it has sort of the same outline as <br/>\ngirlscouts or boyscouts, but I think it&#39;s much more relaxed.
