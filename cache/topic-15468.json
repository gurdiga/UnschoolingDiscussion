In the field of education<br/>\n&gt; there is a growing use of the term transformative learning which appears<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; coming out of multiple and diverse areas of educational concern.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At the Transformative Learning Centre (TLC), we attempt dialogue<br/>\n&gt; between people in areas as diverse as ecological and aboriginal studies;<br/>\n&gt; feminist, anti-racist and post-colonial critiques; popular, global and<br/>\n&gt; holistic education; critical pedagogy and cultural studies. This dialogue<br/>\n&gt; generates creative tensions that have informed and expanded our views of<br/>\n&gt; transformative learning and the possibilities of transformation. Our<br/>\n&gt; intention in hosting this Fourth Annual Conference is to engage other<br/>\n&gt; educators/learners in this broader exploration. The TLC&#39;s working<br/>\n&gt; definition of transformative learning is as follows:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Transformative learning involves experiencing a deep, structural<br/>\n&gt; shift in basic premises of thought, feelings, and actions. It is a shift<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; consciousness that dramatically and permanently alters our way of<br/>\n&gt; being in the world. Such a shift involves our understanding of ourselves<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; our self-locations; our relationships with other humans and with the<br/>\n&gt; natural world; our understanding of relations of power in interlocking<br/>\n&gt; structures of class, race and gender; our body awareness, our visions of<br/>\n&gt; alternative approaches to living; and our sense of possibilities for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>social<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; justice and peace and personal joy.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; This conference will emphasize knowledge diversities, and bring into<br/>\n&gt; dialogue educators from different sites where the language of<br/>\n&gt; transformation is being used. We will continue to carry forward the<br/>\n&gt; history of the previous conferences at Teachers College Columbia<br/>\n&gt; University and the California Institute for Integral Studies (CIIS),<br/>\n&gt; and also expand the boundaries to encourage participation from others. We<br/>\n&gt; will attempt to support this diversity for creative educational dialogue<br/>\n&gt; in the hope of deepening existing theory and practice. In this spirit, the<br/>\n&gt; conference will include :<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Innovative practice workshops<br/>\n&gt; - Paper presentations - Poster presentations and other visual displays<br/>\n&gt; - Presentations by noted leaders in the field of transformative<br/>\n&gt; learning - Arts based performances that address transformation<br/>\n&gt; - Popular education approaches to transformative learning - Self-<br/>\n&gt; organized pre and post conference sessions or workshops - Special speakers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Transformative Learning Centre at OISE/UT (TLC), the Ontario<br/>\n&gt; Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) and the University of Toronto<br/>\n </span></blockquote>are<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sponsoring the Fourth International Conference on Transformative<br/>\n&gt; Learning, in collaboration with the Centre for Arts-informed Research<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(CAIR at<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; OISE/UT), the Indigenous Education Network (IEN at OISE/UT;<br/>\n&gt; http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/other/ien/ienpage.html).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The TLC is also associated with Focus on Work Place Learning and<br/>\n&gt; Change (OISE/UT), Centre for Anti-Racist Studies (OISE/UT), Institute for<br/>\n&gt; Environmental Studies at the University of Toronto (IES;<br/>\n&gt; http://www.utoronto.ca/env/ies/ies.htm), and the Elliot Allen<br/>\n&gt; Institute for Theology and Ecology at St. Michael College-University of<br/>\n&gt; Toronto (http://www.utoronto.ca/stmikes/).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We are also pleased to have the assistance of the Transformation Fici<br/>\n&gt; at Teachers College, Columbia University (http://www.tc.columbia.edu/)<br/>\n&gt; and the California Institute for Integral Studies http://www.ciis.edu/).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The conference design committee is conformed by: Dr. Edmund<br/>\n&gt; O&#39;Sullivan, Dr. Daniel Schugurensky, Lisa Lipsitt, and Renee Shilling.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Luis<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Barnola is responsible of the website and electronic communication.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; CALL FOR PROPOSALS<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To assist potential conference presenters and panel organizers in the<br/>\n&gt; areas listed above, some guiding questions may be kept in mind :<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. In your work as an educator, how do you understand transformative<br/>\n&gt; learning and how does your understanding relate (or not) to the<br/>\n&gt; definition posed above?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. How do you distinguish transformative learning from other types of<br/>\n&gt; learning?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3. Does the process of transformative learning imply or require<br/>\n&gt; particular content, i.e. are all changes transformational? Does any<br/>\n&gt; content-shift constitute transformative learning? Or do we as educators<br/>\n </span></blockquote>make<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; implicit assumptions about what constitutes a &quot;perspective<br/>\n </span></blockquote>transformation&quot;?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4. Transformative education for what? And transformation from what to<br/>\n&gt; what?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 5. People who are not in the formal educational field of<br/>\n&gt; transformative learning nonetheless do transformative education. How do we<br/>\n&gt; understand and theorize this currently unacknowledged work?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In sending a conference proposal (papers and/or panels), identify at<br/>\n&gt; the top what type of proposal it is from the options above. The proposal<br/>\n&gt; should be no more than 350 words (about a page and a half) double<br/>\n&gt; spaced. Participants should also include a short vitae not over half a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>page.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; THE DEADLINE FOR PROPOSALS IS: April 30, 2001.
