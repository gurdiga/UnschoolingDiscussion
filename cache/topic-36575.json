They are feeding their previously repressed apetites, IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had an interesting experience visiting teenage cousins for Easter.<br/>\nPrevious visits had involved lots of video game playing, but mixed with<br/>\nrough-housing and chatting and outside play.

They knew they were going back<br/>\nto restricted use, so they were pedal to the metal all day and evening<br/>\nwith the Nintendo.
