That may be why people <br/>\nare reacting so negatively to it&#39;s use for children. So how about wounded? <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool (not just public school) harms ALL kids, in my opinion. But since <br/>\nalmost everyone in this society has gone through school, identifying the harm <br/>\nisn&#39;t easy unless it&#39;s more extreme than usual. Normally resilient kids can <br/>\ncome out okay, in relation to the rest of society. <br/>\n<br/>\nTaking kids out of school allows the wounds to their intellect to heal, but <br/>\nit&#39;s not the same as not having ever been wounded in the first place. And <br/>\nsome kids aren&#39;t very resilient by nature. They&#39;re slow to heal and they will <br/>\nalways bear scars. But most will eventually heal so you forget that they were <br/>\nwounded, except for every once in a while when something brings their faint <br/>\nscars into high relief. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL<br/>\nmother of a 24yo who went to school for 6 years before unschooling, a 17yo <br/>\nwho has never been to school but lived in a schooled home until age 5, and 2 <br/>\n10yo&#39;s who&#39;ve always lived in an unschooled home.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: &#39;damaged&#39;","postDate":"1026678904","msgId":39187,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNjLjIxMmJlZmUyLjJhNjMzYTc4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39185,"nextInTopic":39190,"prevInTime":39186,"nextInTime":39188,"topicId":39182,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/14/02 1:09:15 PM, caclark1231@cox.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-717658638\">In a message dated 7/14/02 1:09:15 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:caclark1231@...\">caclark1231@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Well said, Liza.
