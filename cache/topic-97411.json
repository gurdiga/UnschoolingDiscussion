Especially if I don&#39;t realize that I&#39;m hungry. So in my <br/>\nexperience food is inextricably linked to emotional well being and it <br/>\nhas nothing to do with an eating disorder. My younger sister is the same <br/>\nway. When she was little (7?) and I was in my early 20s we went to a <br/>\nmuseum and she was acting very emotional and I wasn&#39;t sure why. Then she <br/>\nhad a banana and everything smoothed out. She just hadn&#39;t eaten enough <br/>\nat lunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course it is not healthy to eat to deal with any and all emotions. <br/>\nSometimes you have to employ other solutions. Those people who think <br/>\nfood is the solution to everything have clearly gone too far.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vijay<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Friday, August 6, 2004, at 11:59 PM, Dianne wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; And why make a big connection between food and<br/>\n&gt; emotional well being.<br/>\n&gt; Isn&#39;t that kind of connection between food and<br/>\n&gt; emotions what causes people with eating disorders to<br/>\n&gt; eat in order to feel better.� Food feeds our bodies.<br/>\n&gt; I try to avoid certain things because of what I<br/>\n&gt; believe (and many others believe) to be unhealthy for<br/>\n&gt; my body.� Food does taste good and a lot of people<br/>\n&gt; (including me) enjoy food and there is nothing wrong<br/>\n&gt; with that, but I don&#39;t equate food with my emotional<br/>\n&gt; well being.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; Dianne in Tacoma, WA<br/>\n&gt; Well behaved women don&#39;t make history.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ����� �����<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; New and Improved Yahoo!
