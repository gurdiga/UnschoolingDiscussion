I am ordering it this week for sure. My<br/>\noldest (7) has told me that he wants to live with me when he grows up and<br/>\nhas said that he will take care of me when I am old. He is so sweet. I wish<br/>\nI had (lots of things, but this time) trusted myself more when he was a baby<br/>\nand known folks who did attachment parenting.  I have taken to carrying my<br/>\nvery spirited 3 yr old around a lot more and she is calmer. Just wanted to<br/>\nwrite a little thanks to you folks.  I don&#39;t always agree with everything I<br/>\nsee here but I find information and support  that is hard to come by<br/>\noutside.  And Joel, I am working on a clear answer to your question, just<br/>\ndon&#39;t have much time to think these days. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMary in Idaho (silly, sappy, sweet, sarcastic, strange, smart, sunny, and<br/>\nseriously somebody)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2843,"nextTopicId":2774}}
