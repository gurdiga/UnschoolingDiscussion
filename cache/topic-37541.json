My oldest boy does not like <br/>\ngoing to the library (or even reading for that matter which makes me <br/>\nwonder where he came from, but that&#39;s another story :).  So when I <br/>\ngo, I ask if he wants me to pick up some things... if yes, I get <br/>\nseveral books on different topics I think may interest him, either a <br/>\ntopic he&#39;s already going off on or something new.  Then I set them on <br/>\nthe table, show  him what&#39;s available, and leave it alone.  The other <br/>\n2 younger kids will grab anything they can get their hands on and go <br/>\nat it, no active strewing needed :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as other things go, I think I strew by way of active <br/>\nexample...I spend a lot of time researching all sorts of ideas that <br/>\ncome my way, and usually DO something with the new knowledge I&#39;ve <br/>\ngained.  So, they see me getting excited about a thing, see all my <br/>\nlibrary books and projects associated with it. Sometimes they ask to <br/>\njoin in, or do their own version of it, other times they don&#39;t.  What <br/>\nI hope sticks, is the idea they there is so much to learn and that <br/>\nit&#39;s really fun trying out new things and you don&#39;t ever have to stop <br/>\ndoing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle H</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37463,"nextTopicId":25068}}
