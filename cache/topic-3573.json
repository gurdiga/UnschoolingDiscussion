I look at my friend, trying to decide<br/>\n what to tell her. I want her to know what she will never learn in childbirth<br/>\n classes.  I want to tell her that the physical wounds of child bearing will<br/>\n heal, but that becoming a mother will leave her with an emotional wound<br/>\n so raw that she will forever be vulnerable.<br/>\n I consider warning her that she will never again read a newspaper without<br/>\n asking &quot;What if that had been MY child?&quot; That every plane crash, every<br/>\n house fire will haunt her. That when she sees pictures of starving<br/>\n children, she will wonder if anything could be worse than watching your<br/>\n child die. I look at her carefully manicured nails and stylish suit and think<br/>\n that no matter how sophisticated she is, becoming a mother will reduce her to<br/>\n the primitive level of a bear protecting her cub. That an urgent call of <br/>\n &quot;Mom!&quot;<br/>\n will cause her to drop a souffle or her best crystal without a moment&#39;s <br/>\n hesitation.<br/>\n I feel I should warn her that no matter how many years she has invested in<br/>\n her career, she will be professionally derailed by motherhood.  She might<br/>\n arrange for childcare, but one day she will be going into an important<br/>\n business meeting and she will think of her baby&#39;s sweet smell.  She will<br/>\n have to use every ounce of her discipline to keep from running home, just<br/>\n to make sure her baby is all right.<br/>\n I want my friend to know that everyday decisions will no longer be routine.  <br/>\n That a five-year-old boy&#39;s desire to go to the men&#39;s room rather than the <br/>\n women&#39;s at McDonald&#39;s will become a major dilemma. That right there, in the <br/>\n midst of clattering trays and screaming children, issues of independence and <br/>\n gender identity will be weighed against the prospect that a child molester <br/>\n may be lurking in that restroom.  However decisive she may be at the office, <br/>\n she will second-guess herself constantly as a mother.<br/>\n Looking at my attractive friend, I want to assure her that eventually she<br/>\n will shed the pounds of pregnancy, but she will never feel the same about<br/>\n herself. That her life, now so important, will be of less value to her once<br/>\n she has a child. That she would give it up in a moment to save her <br/>\noffspring, <br/>\n but will also begin to hope for more years -- not to accomplish her own <br/>\n dreams, but to watch her child accomplish theirs.  I want her to know that a <br/>\n cesarean scar or shiny stretch marks will become badges of honor.<br/>\n My friend&#39;s relationship with her husband will change, but not in the way <br/>\nshe <br/>\n thinks. I wish she could understand how much more you can love a man who is <br/>\n careful to powder the baby or who never hesitates to play with his child. I <br/>\n think she should know that she will fall in love with him again for reasons <br/>\n she would now find very unromantic.<br/>\n I wish my friend could sense the bond she will feel with women throughout <br/>\n history who have tried to stop war, prejudice and drunk driving. I hope she <br/>\n will understand why I can think rationally about most issues, but become <br/>\n temporarily insane when I discuss the threat of nuclear war to my children&#39;s<br/>\n future.<br/>\n  I want to describe to my friend the exhilaration of seeing your child learn <br/>\n to ride a bike.  I want to capture for her the belly laugh of a baby who is <br/>\n touching the soft fur of a dog or a cat for the first time.  I want her to <br/>\n taste the joy that is so real, it actually hurts.<br/>\n My friend&#39;s quizzical look makes me realize that tears have formed in my <br/>\n eyes. &quot;You&#39;ll never regret it,&quot; I finally say. Then I reached across the <br/>\n table, squeezed my friend&#39;s hand and offer a silent prayer for her, and for <br/>\n me, and for all of the mere mortal women who stumble their way into this <br/>\nmost <br/>\n wonderful of callings.
