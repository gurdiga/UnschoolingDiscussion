I really appreciate this board and all that it has to <br/>\noffer. I will be telling my friend about this board as she to is interested <br/>\nin homeschooling/unschooling her son.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 oldest boys were attending the community college, my 13 year old still <br/>\nis. My 12 year old decided that it is just not what he wanted to do. So, of <br/>\ncourse I am not going to force him to do anything that he doesn&#39;t want to do. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason why I am asking about the standard, as far as testing is <br/>\nconcerned, is because my 13 year old has already decided that he wants to <br/>\nhave an associates degree in computers before he turns 16. At first I thought <br/>\nthis was going to be very hard for him. I started off by letting him take a <br/>\npiano class, which he loved...and a math class, basic...and he did really <br/>\nwell. I saw him dive into the math books and practice the piano and do what <br/>\nhe needed to do to get the job done. His motivated by his aunt who is <br/>\ngraduating today from the community college with 5 AA degrees. she has <br/>\ntransferred to Sac State as a senior. This has motivated my oldest so much. <br/>\nHe wants to be a doctor just like her. The good thing is that he puts his <br/>\nmind to doing something and there is no turning back. My problem is, I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant him to be overwhelmed in this college thing. So, I am letting him decide <br/>\nif it is too much. Of course I am looking at the changes that he is going <br/>\nthrough, just to monitor everything myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think that this is too much for him? Of course the ultimate decision <br/>\nis mine and his to make, I am just looking for some advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Newbie was re: my biggest concern...","postDate":"1022081779","msgId":37257,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMThKT2U1T1c3bjFVZUhTdHIwMDAwMmMwY0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37309,"prevInTime":37256,"nextInTime":37258,"topicId":37257,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I don&#39;t drive (soon though) so how do I get them away <br/>\n&gt;&gt;from the computer games and the electronic stuff? I know that there is <br/>\n&gt;&gt;learning in everything, but can you help me find it? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would start by playing the computer and electronic games *with* them. Find <br/>\nout what they are getting out of it. Talk to them about the characters, <br/>\nstrategies and such. Get into their world and be truly interested. Then they <br/>\nmay be more willing to get into your world and see what&#39;s interesting there. <br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are so many opportunities for things to do and learn together. What do <br/>\nyou like to do? Invite the kids to join you while you garden or bake or <br/>\nbuild something or shop or take a walk. Talk to them about what you&#39;re doing <br/>\nand why it interests you. Take time to notice the changes of spring. Wonder <br/>\nout loud about why things happen the way they do. Look things up when you <br/>\ndon&#39;t know. Share your experiences with them. Visits to new places, museums, <br/>\nold buildings, new shopping malls...they can all spark a new discussion. A <br/>\ndifferent observation. A meaningful connection for their internal model of <br/>\nthe universe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Are my children going to get what they need?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes! If you are with them and engaged and learning and asking and wondering <br/>\nright along with them, they&#39;ll get what they need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Will they score high, even at grade level on standardized tests?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe. Maybe not. I try not to pay attention to what everyone else&#39;s kid is <br/>\nlearning or doing at any one particular moment. I try to get my kids what <br/>\n*they* need to know at any particluar moment. That&#39;s not going to match all <br/>\nthe other kids in the world. FWIW I know my kids are ahead in some areas of <br/>\nthose standardized tests and behind in others. Just like they&#39;d be if they <br/>\nwere in school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;How will I explain this one to my sister who is always wondering what I am <br/>\n&gt;&gt;doing next?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Give her some books to read on the subject. Or send her here. We&#39;ll explain <br/>\nit to her. ;-) Truth be told, the longer you do this, the more comfortable <br/>\nyou&#39;ll be in explaining it to others. In the beginning, you may want to <br/>\npoint them to the same books, papers and websites that have led you in this <br/>\ndirection.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Should I run out and purchase books or something?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not necessary. But my family LOVES to read books. We go to the library <br/>\na lot. I get books on every topic and just strew them around to see if it <br/>\npiques anyone&#39;s interest. There are books on crafts and science experiments <br/>\nand animals. There are also cool videos and books on tape.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t see where the learning is coming in when we are sitting around the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;house all day long and there is basically nothing in our neighborhood but <br/>\n&gt;&gt;the cars that pass our street.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How about those cars? What kind are they? What year? What else happened in <br/>\nthat year, what was life like then? Where were they manufactured? Where in <br/>\nthe world is that? What else is in that city? How does a car move anyway? <br/>\nWhat&#39;s a combustible engine? Who thought it up? How do people think up such <br/>\ncool ideas? Who were some of the great inventors of our time? Of all time?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m not saying you should actually try to create a unit study on cars or <br/>\nthe questions I just threw out here. I am trying to point out, though, that <br/>\na big part of unschooling is getting yourself to think about the world in a <br/>\ndifferent light. Think about what is, how it got there, what it&#39;s connected <br/>\nto and share those thoughts with your children. When they ask those <br/>\nconnecting kinds of questions, help them to find as much of the answer as <br/>\nthey need at that moment. Let them jump around from topic to topic. Let them <br/>\nobserve and be a part of everyday life. There&#39;s really so much to learn out <br/>\nthere. Enjoy it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37308,"nextTopicId":37310}}
