There has to be a reason for that.**<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have that here too,  which is fine with me,  but I don&#39;t think the other<br/>\nparents are liking it much.   The neighbor kids will come over now and say,<br/>\nwould you like to play?  but we have to go to my house!   I asked why and<br/>\nthe parents have told them they need to be home more,  cuz they&#39;re at school<br/>\nall day and then they need to be home.   So if my kids want to play here,<br/>\nthe neighbor kids have to go home!    Controlling, controlling, controlling.<br/>\nThis is the same family that sends their kids over but they can&#39;t play<br/>\ninside,  have to play outside, cuz the parents said so,  and if they come<br/>\nover they can&#39;t play video games or watch TV!      AARRRGGHH!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe poor kids come to me and say they want to stay at our house.   Yesterday<br/>\nI was away from home with my youngest dd, Kyra(6) and I come home and the<br/>\nneighbor kids are there.   One is 8, one is 6.   My dh said,  &quot;I told XX ,<br/>\nthe 6 yr old,  that Kyra wasn&#39;t here,  but she said &quot;that&#39;s OK&quot;  and walks<br/>\nin&quot;.   So she hung out with my dh.     I feel bad that these kids don&#39;t want<br/>\nto hang out with their own parents.   (Feel sad for the kids)  Their dad and<br/>\nmom were home.   They are home every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":36624936,"authorName":"Jenny E.","from":"&quot;Jenny E.&quot; &lt;mom2jrjedis@...&gt;","profile":"mom2jrjedis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Kids being with parents (was Re: New to the list)","postDate":"1052847837","msgId":68906,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTUwMWMzMTk3NyQzYjE1NzM1MCQ4YmU1MWI0MkBFbGxpb3R0RmFtaWx5Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGI5cXE2cCs5ZTU2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68845,"nextInTopic":69026,"prevInTime":68905,"nextInTime":68907,"topicId":68772,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: Heidi  ...

You stay here and go asleep alone.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I take a deep breath and remind myself that my kids LIKE to tell me stuff <br/>\nand hang out with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning I was taking Marty to buy shoes.  On the way out to the van he <br/>\nveered off and went and brought our trashcan back and put it where it went.  <br/>\nHe wasn&#39;t sucking up, he wasn&#39;t doing something he had to do, he was just <br/>\ndoing something that needed done, and he was close and did it.  I thought of <br/>\nthanking him for that but decided to just talk to him about his plans for the <br/>\nrest of the day instead.  I talked about him, instead of about how his <br/>\nputting the trash can away had made my life easier.  He didn&#39;t do it for me.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s nice that it can get to that point if parents don&#39;t make kids do things <br/>\njust because they&#39;re kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI realize I&#39;m not talking about the school work aspect, but we&#39;ve never had <br/>\nthat.  I&#39;m just trying to point out that it&#39;s not only schoolwork that can <br/>\nmake kids prefer not to be with parents, and I&#39;m very happy to have kids who <br/>\nare easy to be with, and who have nothing to hide from.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68891,"nextTopicId":68943}}
