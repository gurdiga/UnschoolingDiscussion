A brinch sounds like a nice idea for hubby though.  If only we could have some family come for the party, but they are too far away.

The kids & I do lots at church<br/>\nleading up to the grand event.  Christmas morning we open gifts at our house<br/>\nwith the children then go back to the in-laws for breakfast.  But before<br/>\nthat the kids open another round of presents.  This is what they refer to as<br/>\nstuffing on toast.  It&#39;s hot Jimmy Dean sausage, stock and bread stuffing<br/>\nmixed.  It&#39;s even better a few days old.  MIL is Italian, FIL French so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know where this came from but it&#39;s an old tradition for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids are the ones we buy the gifts for but try to make it things they<br/>\nneed & not a lot of toys (got enough of those to last).  For the adults my<br/>\nMIL will draw names for each & we exchange a gift for that one only with a<br/>\n$50. limit.  Usually the person who draws your name asks what you&#39;d like.<br/>\nI&#39;ve made most of our gifts for this exchange, scarfs went over good and<br/>\nwere real easy.  I did them when I was confined to the hospital bed with a<br/>\npregnancy just before Christmas till Dec 17.  Last year I gave both my<br/>\nsister & mother-in-law a small jar with a cork lid & a package of<br/>\nmulticolored small notepads and a note.  When something worth remembering<br/>\nhappens in the family you date a note & write it down & put it in the jar.<br/>\nOn New Year&#39;s Eve (or Christmas) the family is to sit down read through all<br/>\nthe events of the year now past.
