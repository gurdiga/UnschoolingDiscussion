(We discussed adult unschooling instruments a year <br/>\nor so ago, at my request.)  I jump started my learning with a class offerred <br/>\nat our community center called &quot;Instant Piano for Hopelessly Busy People.&quot;  3 <br/>\nhours, 1 day, $45, didn&#39;t stand to lose much so I did it, even if it sounded <br/>\nlike an infomercial.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was perfect for me:  I can read treble clef and knew how to pick out tunes <br/>\nwith my right hand and this class taught chord style piano and taught how to <br/>\nplay chords with your left hand.  So now I can figure out how to play things <br/>\nout of fake books, I&#39;m learning new chords little by little.  I sit down for a <br/>\nfew minutes here and there and play.  I&#39;m very patient with myself and very <br/>\napprecieative of my progress. <br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;m still in awe of the fact that there are so many people who can play this <br/>\ninstrument that requires you to do different things with each hand , without <br/>\nreally looking at your hands, while reading a foreign language (music).
