Find out if they&#39;d <br/>\nlike to volunteer at a local vets office or animal shelter. If you <br/>\nhave a zoo nearby, they may even take teen volunteers. This will not <br/>\nonly help your child learn what&#39;s really involved in working with <br/>\nanimals, it will allow them to form relationships with adults in the <br/>\nfield (who will, in turn, help them learn what it really takes to do <br/>\nthat kind of work). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe child that&#39;s interested in computer programming? Put the word out <br/>\nthat he&#39;s looking for a mentor (if he&#39;s interested). You&#39;d be <br/>\nsurprised at how often adults love the opportunity to share their <br/>\nknowledge with someone who&#39;s really interested in what they do. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, kids *do* learn things because they want to. Sometimes it&#39;s <br/>\nnot clearly visible, especially if it&#39;s not something that we, as <br/>\nparents, think is particularly valuable. But they do learn.
