One night at dinner my husband happened to mention that he was<br/>\nglad<br/>\nhe was feeling ok because when he had used the restroom that morning he<br/>\nhad<br/>\n&quot;produced&quot; blues and green colors he had never seen before.  He had<br/>\nthought<br/>\nhe was coming down with the latest flu, but nothing had materialized ! <br/>\nMy<br/>\nkids chimmed in that they were experiencing the same colorful deposits ! <br/>\nI<br/>\nhad made a beautiful birthday cake for dinner the previous night that had<br/>\nused a rainbow of Wilton color food dyes,  but the primary ones were blue<br/>\nand green.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for dying my children, when my youngest was in kindergarten they had<br/>\nto<br/>\ncome to school the next day  and participate in crazy hair day. I decided<br/>\nto<br/>\nadd glitter to his hair.  I knew that Elmers school glue would disolve<br/>\neven<br/>\nafter it was dried so I used a bit of glue in his hair and added alot of<br/>\nglitter.  I learned that night at bath time that the glue would dissolve,<br/>\nbut the glitter would not come out.  It sticks to your scalp and does not<br/>\ncome off. I even held my poor son upside-down in the water hoping that<br/>\nthe<br/>\nwater would &quot;float&quot; the glitter out since having him sit directly under<br/>\nthe<br/>\nfaucet wasn&#39;t doing a bit of good.  I &quot;dunked&quot; him till my arms ached,<br/>\nbut<br/>\nthe glitter stayed.  It was in his hair for months.  Thank goodness he<br/>\nhad a<br/>\npersonality that could take the teasing and my husband just chalked it up<br/>\nto<br/>\nanother one of my crazy ideas.<br/>\nSusans<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
