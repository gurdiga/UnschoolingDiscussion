The common wisdom you share and how you go about<br/>\npassing it on doesn&#39;t encompass as many styles. And if some new information<br/>\ncomes out, it will be harder for someone to not hear it because no one can<br/>\nmove that far away in England from someone who knows the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut not so in America. We can easily escape new wisdom. America is *vast*.<br/>\nOur common wisdom is pretty spotty. And we don&#39;t have a common method of<br/>\npassing anything on. Probably because we&#39;ve had so many cultures mingling so<br/>\nwe&#39;ve sort of devolved to a set of family practices that will offend the<br/>\nfewest people. Which leaves us with not much of anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m betting in Britain it&#39;s far rarer for a doctor to encounter someone who<br/>\nis totally clueless about what to do during pregnancy. But I bet that&#39;s not<br/>\nso in America.
