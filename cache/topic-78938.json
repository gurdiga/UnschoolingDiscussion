As a coach, I hated having kids who didn&#39;t want to be <br/>\nthere - they could be the nicest kid in the world, but they should be <br/>\nthere because they want to. (just my two cents, fwiw).  I coached <br/>\nsoccer, swimming and softball. My kids like dance and rock climbing (not <br/>\nthe same kids). I coached state champs and all-americans in swimming - <br/>\nmy kids hate competitive swimming. go figure. :-)  ... the two best <br/>\nswimmers I ever coached were there because it was their idea. imho, kids <br/>\nhave to try lots of stuff - some find what they like right away, some <br/>\nhave to try a lot of stuff, and sometimes we get stuck paying for stuff <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t last.
