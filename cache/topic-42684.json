I <br/>\nthink it is very very useful to take some time to consider all that <br/>\nstuff that most people think has to be taught is either learned <br/>\nnaturally by our unschooled kids or not learned because they never need it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n********************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my bestest buds is a private school principal. We&#39;ve had long discussions about a LOT of things that are taught/not taught and learned/not learned in school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPam, you&#39;ve clarified one of the reasons for teaching algebra (separating the college-worthy from the rest). Now, I disagree that we don&#39;t use algebra on a daily basis: I think we DO, but we just have very little use for algebraic *notation*. I think understanding variables is an important thing we learn in day to day living. Notation? Not so much---it&#39;s importance in our adult lives is highly questionable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut how many of us have a dog? How many of us know much about caring for a dog? How many adults get their first dog ever when they have three kids and a mortgage? Oh, lord, let&#39;s not get into the importance of understanding mortgages and insurance and escrow and points and rates and, and, and---because, really...how many of us will ever own a house? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think school misses the boat on really20serious life concerns---like buying a dog or a car or a house. Chances are good that *most* of us will do ONE of these three things. &lt;G&gt; Maybe all three. &lt;G&gt; One or two of us may even buy that yacht Sandra keeps bringing up! &lt;g&gt; But how well does school prepare us for any of them? Not that I think they *can*---I think buying your first house prepares you to buy your second house. &lt;G&gt; But it seems to me that school would cover a few of those things it they thought them valuable enough!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI dare say that I think they would botch that too, but.... &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf school&#39;s *goal* is to prepare children for life &quot;in the real world,&quot; why are algebraic notation, capitals of Africa, and the complete works of Shakespeare so damned important?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI once read a quote from a liberal arts college valedictorian who said that his four expensive years in college prepared him *quite* well for a life of a gentleman farmer in the 18th century. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to Pam&#39;s original question: I think schools (and *society*!) think that *everything* must be TAUGHT.
