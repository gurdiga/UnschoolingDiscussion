It isn&#39;t<br/>\nexactly what we all would say about unschooling, but it doesn&#39;t condemn<br/>\nunschooling and shows some grasp of the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is from the Learning Styles and Homeschooling styles page:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolchristian.com/FAQ/Styles.html\">http://www.homeschoolchristian.com/FAQ/Styles.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n**3) What is unschooling or child-led education?<br/>\n Unschooling is where you become a facilitator and your child chooses<br/>\nwhat to learn. You just supply the materials, transportation, etc. This<br/>\ncan be very<br/>\n frightening to a parent, but it really does work. It doesn&#39;t need to be<br/>\na license for the child to be lazy. The child can be asked to pick goals<br/>\nand to reasonably<br/>\n stick to them, and you can coax the child along toward the chosen<br/>\ngoals. As the 3 R&#39;s don&#39;t take a long time to learn (if you aren&#39;t in<br/>\npublic school), there is<br/>\n usually more than enough time to study what would normally be rather<br/>\nfar out things. Not everybody *needs* to study physics, chemistry, and<br/>\nrocket science.<br/>\n Your children become more self-reliant more quickly. However, it is not<br/>\nfor everyone. Look at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com/.\">http://www.unschooling.com/.</a> --Chuck S. <br/>\n Unschooling is child-directed learning. Parents provide a rich,<br/>\nstimulating atmosphere (don&#39;t ALL home educators do that?), then let the<br/>\nchild find his own<br/>\n path. While most homeschooling parents practice some form of<br/>\ndelight-directed learning, an unschooler practices solely<br/>\ndelight-directed learning. If a child<br/>\n doesn&#39;t want to learn something, he doesn&#39;t. If he chooses to learn<br/>\nmath and reading through Pokemon-trading or Magic:The Gathering cards,<br/>\nthat&#39;s how he<br/>\n does it. If his only interest is aviation, he&#39;s free to pursue it to<br/>\nthe exclusion of everything else if he so desires. Unschooling is NOT<br/>\n&quot;relaxed homeschooling;&quot;<br/>\n relaxed homeschoolers still direct their children&#39;s learning. It is<br/>\n&quot;not-schooling.&quot; The difference between homeschooling and unschooling is<br/>\none of authority --<br/>\n who chooses what your child will be learning? Child-directed =<br/>\nunschooling; parent-directed = homeschooling. A Christian who unschools<br/>\nmust ignore the<br/>\n Biblical commands and examples of parents to teach and disciple, and<br/>\nmust turn a blind eye to what the Bible says about children. Just as<br/>\nhomeschoolers cannot<br/>\n in good conscience ignore that which their children WANT to learn,<br/>\nneither can they neglect what their children NEED to learn. --Chas. **<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling &quot;neglect&quot;","postDate":"1036709336","msgId":49407,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExYi4xOTdkMGE4OC4yYWZjNDdkOEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49405,"nextInTopic":49409,"prevInTime":49406,"nextInTime":49408,"topicId":49400,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/7/2002 5:03:46 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...
