I think it&#39;s almost <br/>\nalways the organized people that hold the resentment towards the <br/>\nless-than-organized.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes my husband cleans the kitchen.  Not often.  If he did it often, or <br/>\ndid it with me, that might be better.  He doesn&#39;t like to be in the kitchen <br/>\nwith another person, though.  It really bothers him to bump into somone, and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t like it when he puts things away, generally, because he&#39;s irritating.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have places things go.  Muffin pans are just stacked in with pizza pans and <br/>\ncookie sheets.  The organization has two priorities:  (1) the thing last used <br/>\ngoes on top, unless (2) that will make the pile unstable, in which case it <br/>\ngoes wherever keeps it from falling.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith thinks that&#39;s wrong.  But his new improved way will take more room or <br/>\nresult in an unstable pile.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a drawer for sharp things and another drawer for things used for <br/>\nstovetop purposes that aren&#39;t sharp.  This is a safety thing.  We only have one <br/>\ndanger-drawer.    Keith doesn&#39;t understand the danger-drawer concept and <br/>\nsometimes a knife or can opener or peeler is in the safe drawer.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI have old bowls stacked separately from matching sets of bowls.  Keith <br/>\nstacks them mixed up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe loses things.  He makes places up.  It&#39;s more important to him that the <br/>\ncounter is cleaned off regardless of what he shoves where.   I thing &quot;shoving <br/>\nwhere&quot; is rude, and the counter doesn&#39;t need to be clean.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHis stuff in the garage is really well organized, and sometimes I hesitate to <br/>\nuse something because I know I can&#39;t put it back the way it was wrapped up <br/>\nand I probably can&#39;t reach the place he had it anyway.  So years ago I figured <br/>\nout that I use it, I arrange it artfully in the middle of a space, and I <br/>\napologize to him for not having put it back.  That makes him happy.  He puts it <br/>\nback.  It&#39;s better for me than the result of my having put it back in the wrong <br/>\nplace, or turned righty instead of lefty.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wanted to use our old computer.  I cleaned off about eight square feet of <br/>\ndesk space (it&#39;s a door on short filing cabinets).  That made him happy.  I <br/>\ntotally removed the hamster and most of my regular stuff so he could lay whole <br/>\nfolders out on flat space.  Cheap thrills for him, that I did a totally <br/>\n&quot;counter-cleaning.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nLucky for me I remembered where I put the hamster.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been together 25 years, so I guess he&#39;s survived the organization I <br/>\nhave which really looks like no organization, and I&#39;ve survived his <br/>\nlooks-like-organization which is sometimes just &quot;clean some flat space at any cost.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87030,"nextTopicId":87047}}
