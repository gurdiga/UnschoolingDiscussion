This is something my DS really <br/>\nstruggled with and still does, to some extent. At age 4, he was <br/>\nevaluated for Hirschsprungs disease, because his pediatrician thought <br/>\nthat his issues were serious enough, that might be what it was. He <br/>\npotty trained relatively late (after 4), and with difficulty, but in <br/>\nreality his bowels have never ever been normal. Discovering his dairy <br/>\nallergy helped a *lot* because when he was eating dairy it really <br/>\nslowed everything down even more. It was just after removing dairy <br/>\nfrom his diet that he was finally able to potty train. I was just <br/>\nhaving a conversation the other day though with a friend whose <br/>\ndaughter has Hirschprungs about the fact that there are more problems <br/>\nalong the continuum than just that or nothing. He might still have <br/>\nmotility or other issues that are causing problems. She is on a list <br/>\nthat includes Hirschprungs and also motility issues. Might be worth <br/>\ndoing a Google search for.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, we just try to keep him mindful of what he is eating - <br/>\nmake sure he doesn&#39;t have more than one banana a day (boy does that <br/>\ndo a number on him if he does), and remind him to drink fluids if he <br/>\nforgets, that kind of thing. Because this can be a painful and <br/>\ndisruptive condition, as well as something kids can be embarassed <br/>\nabout (or other people can try to make them embarassed about), it can <br/>\nbe a hard thing to deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to admit, I felt pretty justified when my 2nd kid potty <br/>\ntrained herself at 18 months. At least then people couldn&#39;t say it <br/>\nwas somehow my fault that my son had so many difficulties with it. <br/>\nWhen they&#39;re ready, they&#39;re ready, and for some kids it comes years <br/>\nlater than others, but it&#39;s a good idea to make sure there isn&#39;t a <br/>\nmedical condition or allergy that is causing or exacerbating the <br/>\ndifficulty.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":84405537,"authorName":"Roxanne Trimper","from":"&quot;Roxanne Trimper&quot; &lt;Trimpertribe@...&gt;","profile":"ttribemomma911","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"OT: Potty Training with constipation","postDate":"1088530164","msgId":95984,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNiczh0ayt2aG1AZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwNjI3MTQwODUwLjgzNDkyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwNDA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":95948,"nextInTopic":96026,"prevInTime":95983,"nextInTime":95985,"topicId":5385,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Leslie, You mentioned that your 5 year old was having difficulty potty training and that he had chronic constipation.

My name is Leslie and I have two boys(5 and 2).  The whole potty training thing has been a struggle for my oldest.  He&#39;s had chronic constipation since he was 18 months old and because of this, was afraid to go on the potty.  I took him to a pediatrician who&#39;s physician&#39;s assistant was looking at him problem as an excuse to put him medication, i.e. Ritalin.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe tried everything for potty training, videos, music, books, stickers. If I had a nickel for every time I read, Once Upon A Potty!  Anyway, when we finally got his constipation problem at bay, I took him to a specialist for the training.  She told me to put him in regular underwear during the day.  When he sat on the potty, he got a star sticker and when he peed or pooped, he got a Spongebob sticker.  The first week or so was rough but he finally just did it one day and hasn&#39;t had an accident since.  Although I do think the program I took him to was a good program, I just think he was finally ready to do it.  Most of the frustration for both of us was the pressure from friends and family to &quot;get him trained&quot; especially after he turned five in March.  I started the whole thing telling people that he was the type of child that did things when he was good and ready to do them.  I wished I would have adhered to that idea.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t know why it is so hard for some people to view children as human beings and not puppets or robots that need to be controlled.  Just my two cents on the topic.  Hope it wasn&#39;t too long.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
