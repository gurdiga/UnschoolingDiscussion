If something does really bother him, he<br/>\n&gt; regulates his own diet by eating only at home for a period of time before<br/>\n&gt; he ventures out to eat more junk food.  I figure with seeing the results<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; good eating, once he is past the stage that has earned me the button that<br/>\n&gt; reads &quot;have pity on me I am the mother of a teenager&quot;, he will stick with<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; healthy diet and not have any problems at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would say that half his problem was actual food allergies (dairy) and<br/>\n&gt; half was due to chemicals in the food and refined food products.  If I buy<br/>\n&gt; organic, he can occasionally eat a little dairy (like ice cream or yogurt)<br/>\n&gt; and not suffer greatly.  He can eat &quot;white&quot; bread and cinnamon rolls if I<br/>\n&gt; make them from organic ingredients and use whole wheat flour.  But, he<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t take a steady diet of these types of foods.  The real key has been<br/>\n&gt; going organic and getting rid of all the hidden things in products (lead<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; some cans, chemicals to &quot;preserve&quot; packaging, MSG &quot;hiding&quot; under other<br/>\n&gt; names, etc.).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lynda, whose kids now call her the grocery Sherlock.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HPaulson5@...\">HPaulson5@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] sugar and food - Long<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, May 30, 2000 7:58 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lynda,  I so appreciate you taking the time to write.

Also,  the<br/>\n&gt; intestinal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; troubles your son had... were they due to allergies?  Is he on a special<br/>\n&gt; diet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; now?  Sorry to have so many questions--  but, again, this  is very<br/>\n&gt; important,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I want to learn as much as I can.

Most health food stores carry it and major<br/>\nstores that have organic foods such as Organic Valley (look at their<br/>\nwebsite for a list of stores).<br/>\n<br/>\nDerek is 16, therefore, being a typical teenager, sticking with a strict<br/>\ndiet is near impossible.  However, with all the changes we have made in the<br/>\nhouse, the &quot;junk&quot; he eats when he isn&#39;t at home does not seem to have a<br/>\ngreat a negative effect on him.  If something does really bother him, he<br/>\nregulates his own diet by eating only at home for a period of time before<br/>\nhe ventures out to eat more junk food.  I figure with seeing the results of<br/>\ngood eating, once he is past the stage that has earned me the button that<br/>\nreads &quot;have pity on me I am the mother of a teenager&quot;, he will stick with a<br/>\nhealthy diet and not have any problems at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say that half his problem was actual food allergies (dairy) and<br/>\nhalf was due to chemicals in the food and refined food products.  If I buy<br/>\norganic, he can occasionally eat a little dairy (like ice cream or yogurt)<br/>\nand not suffer greatly.  He can eat &quot;white&quot; bread and cinnamon rolls if I<br/>\nmake them from organic ingredients and use whole wheat flour.  But, he<br/>\ncan&#39;t take a steady diet of these types of foods.  The real key has been<br/>\ngoing organic and getting rid of all the hidden things in products (lead in<br/>\nsome cans, chemicals to &quot;preserve&quot; packaging, MSG &quot;hiding&quot; under other<br/>\nnames, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda, whose kids now call her the grocery Sherlock.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HPaulson5@...\">HPaulson5@...</a><br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] sugar and food - Long<br/>\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, May 30, 2000 7:58 AM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lynda,  I so appreciate you taking the time to write.

It all came to a<br/>\nhead when we bought a new mattress (and it wasn&#39;t a cheapy either, d*mn,<br/>\none almost can&#39;t afford to sleep anymore &lt;g&gt;).  I would wake up totally<br/>\nclogged, both sinuses and lungs.  I decided that I wasn&#39;t paying another<br/>\ndoctor another dime and started going through every book I could find and<br/>\nthen started on the net.  WOW, the things I found out that &quot;they&quot; don&#39;t<br/>\nreally want us to know.  Take formaldehyde, please.  It is in everything!!!<br/>\n AND, if you go and look at a modular home in a sales lot you will see<br/>\nsigns posted saying &quot;Anyone with respiratory problems, blah, blah, blah,<br/>\nshould be informed that living in one of these may be hazardous to your<br/>\nhealth.&quot;  Well, formaldehyde is the culprit.  It is in floors, carpeting,<br/>\nAND your clothes and sheets!  We got rid of all the permanent pressed junk<br/>\nthat had been processed with &quot;f&quot; and all the flame retardant clothes for<br/>\nthe kidlets.  That cut all our sneezing and coughing attacks in half.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I read about PVC and other plastics (because of hubby&#39;s landscaping we<br/>\ngot a couple of flyers in the mail which started me on my Sherlocking of<br/>\nplastics).  Geez, here we are putting this stuff in our homes to carry our<br/>\ndrinking water and kryovacing our meats and cheeses with it and nucking<br/>\nstuff in it and it is &quot;off-gassing.&quot;  Out went the plastics.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I read about the aluminum and its correlation with not only<br/>\nAlzheimer&#39;s but several other conditions.  So out went the aluminum pans<br/>\n(Revere Ware loves me now &lt;g&gt;).  And then, gasp, I happened to be buying<br/>\nsome baking powder and youngest kidlet was just starting to do the read all<br/>\nthe ingredients thingy and guess what is in your baking powder--ALUMINUM!<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, the more garbage we removed, the better everyone felt.  This<br/>\nlast winter not one of the kidlets had more than a minor sniffle and we had<br/>\na soggy, damp, cold winter.  I&#39;ve been sick but it has been related to my<br/>\nkidneys and &quot;female&quot; problems that go with age.  BUT, nothing like the past<br/>\nmore years than I want to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe thought for sure we would have a problem with the kids when I went<br/>\nthrough the cupboards and tossed everything but it has been a surprisingly<br/>\neasy transition.  There are sooooo many good things out there that aren&#39;t<br/>\n&quot;hippy&quot; foods as the kidlets call them, that everyone is feeling better and<br/>\ndoing better.  Eldest son had horrible allergies and almost every single<br/>\none of them is gone (he still does a little sneezing and occasionally will<br/>\nhave red irritated eyes but the honey really seems to be helping).  Middle<br/>\nkidlet was supposedly severely ADD and he is just galloping along with<br/>\nprojects AND he finishes them (I think it was allergies).  Also, eldest<br/>\nkidlet had severe intestinal problems from birth (collick so bad the only<br/>\nthing that helped was taking him for long rides in the car), severe gas<br/>\npains, bloating, attacks like appendicitis, the whole nine yards.  He would<br/>\nend up on a clear liquid diet as it was the only thing he could tolerate. <br/>\nSince we went to all organic, got rid of the MSG/preservatives and all<br/>\nartificial flavors, etc., he hasn&#39;t had one attack in over six months!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoa, didn&#39;t mean to write a novel here.
