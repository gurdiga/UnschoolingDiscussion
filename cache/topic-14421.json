I have a friend whose 2 year old<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  daughter has cradle cap.  Is this possible?  I&#39;ve never really noticed<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  it on this little girl before but her mother claims that she&#39;s always<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  had it and as the hair is growing longer it&#39;s starting to grow unevenly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  and even patchy in some areas.  Does anyone have any<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  advice/ideas/wondercures to help us out here?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Another concern I have for this little sweetie (I occasionally babysit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  her) is she seems to drink an AWFUL LOT for such a wee thing.  Every<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  time she is here I will see her go through 4 or 5 or more (?), 8-10<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  ounce tumblers of watered down juice in a 4-5 hour period.  Is it just<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  me or is this excessive?  She just seems to glug and glug and glug.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  sure as a result of this plentiful fluid intake she also does not tend<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  to eat much.  To me, her little tummy seems un-naturally swelled and not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  just with &quot;baby fat&quot;.  To feel her abdomen, she is very firm to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  touch.  I have had some basic and vague discussion with the mother about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  the girl&#39;s fluid intake and the Mom definitely agrees that little<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &quot;Mikayla&quot; drinks a lot.  I&#39;m not sure how vigorously she has pursued it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  with a doctor.  I worry about this dear girl as I know her life is not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  an easy one.  I wonder if Mikayla may be experiencing some stress as she<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  has been in a lot of daycare situations for extended periods of time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Her mother is single and works long hours.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Any help, ideas, suggestions anyone might have would be greatly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  appreciated.  Is anyone out there in the medical profession?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Thank you so much,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Sonia in Saskatchewan<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"NicholasAcademy@aol.com","from":"NicholasAcademy@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"t-4U5VyhXtgkloRKh0kPPLK4Qvt9MbKDXfpPJp7u5fKZUPROItBqcPJA4mJqAZR98xTN6yCtH1FelqVN-8U","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Some advice please!!!","postDate":"976326481","msgId":14453,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM0LmRmNGM2MGEuMjc2MmU5NTFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":14452,"nextInTopic":14454,"prevInTime":14452,"nextInTime":14454,"topicId":14421,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/8/00 8:19:28 AM Pacific Standard Time, ... to ...

Ds had it and still does at <br/>\n5 if we don&#39;t keep it under control.  The first mistake I made in treating it <br/>\nwas to use creams and oils (don&#39;t remember what, but everything was <br/>\nrecommended by family as what they had heard was good).  Finally, I was told <br/>\nby a doctor to use dandruff shampoo and to gently scrub the scalp, and use a <br/>\nfine comb to remove it while the hair and scalp are wet.  This worked <br/>\nwonders.  Within the first week, it was gone (under control).  Now, if we <br/>\ndon&#39;t scrub while shampooing, his will return.  I noticed a small patch when <br/>\nwe were having his hair cut.  I didn&#39;t realize it was the same thing, but <br/>\nthat&#39;s what the beautician told me.  She also said it was not uncommon (in <br/>\nher opinion) for a 5yo to have it.  We had long since stopped using the <br/>\nshampoo. The dandruff shampoo the doctor recommended was Selsun Blue, by the <br/>\nway, but I&#39;m sure any dandruff shampoo would work.  He also told us cradle <br/>\ncap was an oil based condition, so applying creams and oils was only <br/>\ncontributing to the problem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the liquids go, ds is a heavy consumer.  He drinks milk, however, <br/>\nand not juice.  He has been drinking three to four gallons a week for the <br/>\npast couple of years, and probably two to three gallons before that.  We <br/>\nalways have food available for him and he eats when he is hungry.  We also <br/>\ngive him a multi vitamin daily.  I personally wouldn&#39;t want him to drink that <br/>\nmuch juice.  Juice messes with my digestive system (especially if I drink it <br/>\nbefore a meal), so I am leery of it, but I don&#39;t really know if that might be <br/>\nwhat is affecting her.  I have heard that most children at that age go <br/>\nthrough a period where they don&#39;t eat much.  Ds had a very healthy appetite <br/>\nat that age, however, so I can&#39;t offer any advice there.  I know many others <br/>\nwill be along with plenty of suggestions for you, though.   <br/>\n<br/>\nCheryl<br/>\nNicholas Academy Homeschooling Resources<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nicholasacademy.homestead.com\">http://nicholasacademy.homestead.com</a><br/>\nGet paid for your opinion!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nicholasacademy.epinions.com\">http://nicholasacademy.epinions.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 12/7/00 11:54:17 PM Pacific Standard Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sulan@...\">sulan@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Hi Everyone,<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;ve asked for advice related to health concerns in the past and I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;  like to do it again now if I may.

More shampooing never helped.  The advice in What to Expect<br/>\nthe First Year is to use baby oil, massage into the scalp, comb through,<br/>\nand wash out.  I did try this.  It only worked temporarily and was a<br/>\nmajor pain.  When just left alone it would come and go, never bothered<br/>\nthe kids, and was generally gone by about 2 1/2 or 3.  I&#39;ve also read<br/>\nthat it causes no harm to the children.  I have babysat many children and<br/>\nbeen involved in many mothers&#39; groups.  I have seen many, many children<br/>\nwith this.  IMO it is a normal baby thing.<br/>\n     About the fluid intake, I agree with you that this will cause her to<br/>\neat less.  It will give her many unneeded empty calories.  Although I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it will really harm her,  I do think it is what she is used<br/>\nto and uses it for comfort.  Does she take a pacifier or have a favorite<br/>\ntoy or blanket that she takes everywhere?  You could try distracting her<br/>\nwith activities that keep her hands busy or try different snacks that she<br/>\ncan help prepare.  Of course, the Mom should discuss it with her doctor. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                 Yvonne<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
