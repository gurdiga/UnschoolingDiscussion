We loved those books so much. And there&#39;s lots of them- more than twenty I think- and they&#39;re long, so we were just immersed in that world for months. They&#39;re exciting, with battles and sword fights (among squirrels, and mice, and moles etc), but also incredibly sweet and cosy and comforting to read. The animals have the most wonderful feasts and my son and I followed suit: we invited my parents for dinner, made and printed out fancy illustrates menus with quotes from various Redwall characters, and cooked some of the foods from the books (Basil Stag Hare Leek Soup! &#39;Unnymoles! October Ale! Raspberry Fizz!). It was SO much fun. Feeling nostalgic now...hmm, I might have to reread those books. Thanks for the reminder, Sandra. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are reading a great trilogy now that my son is really loving (he is 12, but these would be great for younger or older as well): Leviathan, Behemoth and Goliath, by Scott Westerfield. Two young teens, and no school, but lots of airships and daring adventure and genetically engineered creatures, as well a fascinating alternate version of World War One... We learned some history and geography from looking up various things and going off on tangents, as one does... and there are gorgeous black and white illustrations.

1970&#39;s, without the internet.  Caitlin<span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\"> realised there was nobody &#39;like her family&#39; represented on the television (home schooled and working class) and she and her sister have written a sit-com loosely based around their childhood.  It&#39;s called &#39;Raised By Wolves&#39; and is into it&#39;s second series on the UK Channel 4.  I have to say we all find it absolutely brilliant, if a little edgy - lots of swearing, smoking and sexual references - like in real families with teenagers ;-)  - but all with love and humour.  My 12 year old girl

particularly like the episode where one of the daughters decides to go to school &#39;because she isn&#39;t learning anything&#39; at home.  She wants to learn calculus etc.  She is expelled on her first day as she is so appalled at the lack of respect for learning that she shouts &#39;doesn&#39;t anyone have any *****ing respect for Marco Polo in this classroom?&#39; or words to that effect.

The main characters are","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-330044845\">The Five Kingdom series by Brandon Mull is another great adventure story that is set outside of schools (and actually not on Earth).  The main characters are mostly kids (~11 years old) and they travel all through an alternate world called the Outskirts, having lots of adventures while trying to find their way back to Earth.  The story starts in school, but then quickly leaves that well behind.  The kids travel all over the place and no one ever wonders why they aren&#39;t in school and it doesn&#39;t seem like kids in the Outskirts even go to school.  This has been a fun read for me, but I should mention that only four of the five books are written currently (the last book won&#39;t come out until fall 2017).  The Beyonders by Brandon Mull is another book series with a similar premise to the Five Kingdoms books (different stories, though) and I would recommend that book as well for anyone who loves adventure stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Familiars by Adam Jay Epstein & Andrew Jacobson and the Wings of Fire dragon books are two other fun series that have nothing to do with school or school issues (it helps that the main characters aren&#39;t human I suppose!).The Land of Stories books by Chris Colfer is another series that we&#39;ve really enjoyed listening to as an audio book (the author reads his books and he is spectacular with voices!).  The main characters go to school, but the lead girl opts out of school after a while (and the stories have very little to do with school actually).  The two main characters, a brother and sister, have a very supportive and loving family and a good relationship with them (which isn&#39;t often the case in novels about teens).  My oldest thinks I should add the How to train Your Dragon books by Cressida Cowell to this list as well.  She says they are in pirate school, training to be pirates, but that it is nothing like regular school.  I haven&#39;t read those books yet, though, so I don&#39;t know how appropriate to the topic they really are.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, my kids and I really love watching Curious George episodes.  Because he&#39;s a &quot;monkey&quot; (he&#39;s actually a chimpanzee I think, which is not a monkey) he doesn&#39;t have to go to school, so he is free to be curious about everything and has the time and support to explore all the things he&#39;s curious about.  Basically, he&#39;s a perfect example of unschooling in action!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, 4/2/16, Robin Stevenson <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rhswriting@...\">rhswriting@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Books for Unschoolers<br/>\n To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n Date: Saturday, April 2, 2016, 12:28 PM<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n   <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n     <br/>\n       <br/>\n       <br/>\n       The Wanderer, by Sharon Creech, is beautifully<br/>\n written. The story takes place on a sail boat, so no school,<br/>\n and it is very much about self-discovery. The main character<br/>\n is 13 and an independent thinker. It&#39;s a quiet story-<br/>\n wouldn&#39;t appeal to every kid- but I think it is an<br/>\n exceptionally good one.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n A more exciting, faster paced read is Raider&#39;s Ransom,<br/>\n and the sequel Flood and Fire, both by Emily Diamand. Both<br/>\n are set in a future, slightly dystopian (but not too dark)<br/>\n world. The main characters are fabulously free, independent<br/>\n and unfettered, and it is a terrific adventure story (no<br/>\n school, no bullying, lots of humor, plus a cat, boats,<br/>\n rocket launchers and- in the second book- a terrific AI who<br/>\n may actually be an advanced gaming system).

The story takes place on a sail boat, so no school, and it is very much about self-discovery. The main character is 13 and an independent thinker. It&#39;s a quiet story- wouldn&#39;t appeal to every kid- but I think it is an exceptionally good one.<br/>\n<br/>\nA more exciting, faster paced read is Raider&#39;s Ransom, and the sequel Flood and Fire, both by Emily Diamand. Both are set in a future, slightly dystopian (but not too dark) world. The main characters are fabulously free, independent and unfettered, and it is a terrific adventure story (no school, no bullying, lots of humor, plus a cat, boats, rocket launchers and- in the second book- a terrific AI who may actually be an advanced gaming system). Highly recommend these ones! <br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":551378857,"authorName":"Robin Stevenson","from":"Robin Stevenson &lt;rhswriting@...&gt;","profile":"robinhstevenson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Books for Unschoolers","postDate":"1459613709","msgId":76912,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA4NUI5NEQ2LTVFMzYtNEJBMy1BQUZGLUQyMjA0Q0I5NTkzM0BnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76911,"nextInTopic":76913,"prevInTime":76911,"nextInTime":76913,"topicId":76904,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh, I so loved all Gerald Durrell s books when I was a kid- I should read them again; thank you for the wonderful reminder.

The family (artsy and rather eccentric) have a free-form kind of home school called The Creative Academy. One of the characters actually wants more structure, if my memory is correct. It&#39;s not quite unschooling but it is unschooling-ish and very well written (it won the Newberry award): &nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surviving_the_Applewhites\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surviving_the_Applewhites</a></div><div><br></div><div>I also came across a young teen novel a few years ago called the Homeschool Liberation &nbsp;League. It&#39;s about a girl who wants to unschool (after meeting an unschooler at camp). Her parents agree to try homeschooling but it&#39;s school-at-home, which is not what she wants. She does all kinds of rather academic stuff to prove to them that she can learn without imposed structure but they never really get on board. And I kind of think she may end up opting for an alternative school in the end. Disappointing in some ways, but not unrealistic. Might be an interesting one to look at:&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lucy-frank/the-homeschool-liberation-league/\">https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lucy-frank/the-homeschool-liberation-league/</a></div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m actually an author- 20 books for kids and teens, and so far all the kids in those books are schooled- I think just because that was my own experience. My son said I should write one about an unschooler- so the current novel in progress is about a 12 year old unschooled girl (also time travel!). Anyway, assuming my usual publisher wants it, it&#39;ll be 2-3 years before that one is on the shelves...but I am having so much fun writing it. (Hopefully some of our story-loving kids will grow up to write some fabulous books about unschoolers- there is a real gap, and it gets tiresome reading about school all the time.)</div><div><br><div>Sent from my iPad</div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":349107890,"authorName":"Elise","from":"Elise &lt;elise.lauterbach@...&gt;","profile":"eliselauterbach","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Books for Unschoolers","postDate":"1459604108","msgId":76911,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdEMjc3QzcxLTY4ODUtNDYxMi05MUEyLUMwMDkwQTcwQjM2N0BnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76910,"nextInTopic":76912,"prevInTime":76910,"nextInTime":76912,"topicId":76904,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We also keep an eye out for non-schoolish books, and some of our favorites are the Swallows and Amazons series by Arthur Ransom, about four siblings who have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-682021928\">We also keep an eye out for non-schoolish books, and some of our favorites are the Swallows and Amazons series by Arthur Ransom, about four siblings who have free reign to sail and explore all over the Lake District, camping on deserted islands, exploring caves, etc.. Jean George&#39;s trilogy that begins with My Side of the Mountain is another wonderful classic series of children working and living their passions. We also loved the newer Penderwicks series by Jean Birdsall-- most of the books take place in the summer, and the children have lovely, supportive parents and lots of exciting adventures. Kelly Barnhill&#39;s The Witch&#39;s Boy exists in a world without school. Blue Baillett&#39;s novels, mysteries about art and architecture, also feature kids surrounded by supportive adults, and include quiet, thoughtful critiques of formal education-- one of the best adults is 4th grade teacher who tries to deconstruct her classroom. <br/>\n<br/>\nElise Lauterbach<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":430722916,"authorName":"","from":"mellingersa@...","profile":"mellingersa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re[2]: [AlwaysLearning] Books for Unschoolers","postDate":"1459536544","msgId":76910,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0NTk1MzY1NDQuNjMyMDczNjEyQGYxMy5teS5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTUhKS0wtdWlmR2FCTi1aK2tLZVhWSG1fYXc4enVINlF4TjZoU3MxUjZyN2tyMzBYZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG5kbTRsNisxa3ZpMm9tQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPENBTUhKS0wtOTZxaGI0Rlo3Vm8wM1JUPVBZcS09WStDaEVGS2Ywby1UZUd2ME9SRTZVZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPENBTUhKS0wtdWlmR2FCTi1aK2tLZVhWSG1fYXc4enVINlF4TjZoU3MxUjZyN2tyMzBYZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76909,"nextInTopic":76911,"prevInTime":76909,"nextInTime":76911,"topicId":76904,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sparkle stories - a subscription app for audiobooks.
