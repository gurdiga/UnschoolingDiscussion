My uncle had the stomach reduction and lost<br/>\nabout 200lbs and has had few and minor complications which he says were<br/>\nnothing compared with his improved health.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother went a different route and had a less drasic Lap-band installed<br/>\nwhich is an inflatable band around the stomach that can be inflated or<br/>\ndeflated after the surgery with a simple office visit.  Because they don&#39;t<br/>\nactuslly remove any tissue, the risks and discomfort of this option are<br/>\nsuposed to be less than with the reduction surgery.  If you want, you can<br/>\nwrite me off list and I&#39;ll put you in touch with my brother.  He has lots of<br/>\ninfo and would be happy to share it. I am praying for you.<br/>\nKrisula<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ren [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, September 06, 2003 3:39 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] good news<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you pray, or light candles, or send good thoughts, or what ever you<br/>\ndo...<br/>\nplease keep me and especially my family in your thoughts.
