Sam is quite adept at computer games like Imaginext, <br/>\nZoombinis, Scooby-Doo.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe often has a really hard time doing things and going places that the <br/>\ngirls really enjoy, and I&#39;m trying to come up with strategies. He would <br/>\nprefer to be home playing his computer games, so I was thinking a <br/>\ngameboy might be a good solution. Other things/ distractions haven&#39;t <br/>\nbeen successful, and I find I&#39;m mostly wrestling him, which is <br/>\nexhausting. Meaning I&#39;m usually his jungle gym, letting him climb from <br/>\nshoulders to my hip, jump, somersault up my legs, etc. or taking him out <br/>\nfor walks in which case I miss much of whatever it is we&#39;re doing. <br/>\nLeaving him home isn&#39;t really an option either because 1) he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike being with other people and 2) we don&#39;t really know anyone who <br/>\ncould keep him during the day even if I would leave him. The girls have <br/>\nalways liked museums and other kinds of stuff, even at early ages; Sam <br/>\nruns hot/cold with short bursts of attention. I&#39;d rather not stop doing <br/>\nthese kinds of things--being a human jungle gym is still preferable to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also open to other suggestions. I gave my Sears&#39; sling away a couple <br/>\nyears ago, but I was toying with the idea of picking up another one at a <br/>\nsecond hand store. Sam doesn&#39;t much like to be confined, but it might <br/>\nmake the constant holding/ putting down easier on me, and it&#39;s not all <br/>\nthat bulky to carry when he&#39;s not interested. I remember using it quite <br/>\noften when Em was older as a piggyback carrier.
