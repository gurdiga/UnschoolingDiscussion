Because someone has a favorite <br/>\nof anything, does not mean they do not like, can not tolerate, do not want <br/>\nanything to do with the other things in that category.   My favorite ice cream <br/>\nflaver is Edy&#39;s Blue Ribbon Chocolate Cake ( O.. MG.. delicious!)  But, I <br/>\nwouldnt turn any other flavor of ice cream down.. lol.  I cant think of a flavor I <br/>\nhate.., or even dislike.    My favorite color is pink.. I do not care for <br/>\nbrown.    I can&#39;t pick a favorite movie.. I have too many that I equally like.   A <br/>\nlist of favorites can go on and on.  The point is, having a favorite does not <br/>\nautomatically mean you hate &quot;the rest&quot;.    <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly  called babies slugs.. some are slugs.. lol.   Mine were screaming <br/>\nmimis.   BUT, when they were not crying with colic, they were so sweet and <br/>\nwonderful.   More like cherubs than slugs :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\n I love the baby stage, to me they ARE growing and learning and changing <br/>\neveryday.  They learn to smile, to roll over, sit up, crawl.. They learn to be <br/>\n&quot;people&quot;.   I remember being so enthralled when each of my children discovered <br/>\ntheir hands and toes. I  also loved watching them bat thier little hands at <br/>\nthier mobiles or toys, seeing them laugh and bounce in thier bouncy seats.. stand <br/>\nup on thier tippy toes, they giggle and squeal with delight at the least <br/>\nlittle thing.  You can usually distract and entertain an infant with raspberry( the <br/>\nblowing kind, not the eating kind..lol).. that does not last long..When my 8 <br/>\nyo is bored , blowing a raspberry has little effect. <br/>\nReally, the infant stage is when babies learn the most in the shortest amount <br/>\nof time.  Think about it. usually within one year, they go from &#39;slug&quot;.. <br/>\n(hehehe) to a babbling, walking, eating, playing, interactive little person.<br/>\n<br/>\nBabies offer that sweet unconditional love, they are so innocent and <br/>\nprecious.  They can be &quot;demanding&quot; and needy, but that dependency on me made me feel <br/>\nspecial and .. well.. needed.<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nSee, my perspective of babyhood is different from Kelly&#39;s.  But that is OK.  <br/>\nI could also list the merits of Edys Blue Ribbon Chocolate Cake ice cream, but <br/>\nthat doesnt mean everyone would like it as much as I do. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, btw, my least favorite age is puberty!   Whether it starts at 9 or 14, <br/>\nits the pits.  I wouldnt trade my kids in when they hit puberty, but.. I do need <br/>\na few more of those &quot;escape&quot; days.. lol<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78165,"nextTopicId":78101}}
