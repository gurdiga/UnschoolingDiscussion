It simply means<br/>\nnot doint to them what schools do, which is force them to think about<br/>\ncertain things, to study those things in certain ways using certain books<br/>\nand certain people called teachers, all with schedules and in certain<br/>\nlocations. <br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, UNschooling is narrowly defined simply by the absence of forced<br/>\nschooling. It allows the child to be a free learner, to follow his/her<br/>\ncuriosity as much as possible. The parent&#39;s role in it is to be available to<br/>\nhelp when that curiosity needs satisfying. At those times, a parent can be a<br/>\ngreat help, and, I believe, should try to be. For example, if a child wants<br/>\nto be &quot;schooled&quot; in a subject, then that is the child&#39;s choice in how to<br/>\nfollow his/her curiosity about it. What keeps it under the description of<br/>\nUNschooling is the lack of force and the initiative coming from the kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, if a kid is interested in history, then simply &quot;living life&quot;<br/>\nwill not teach the kid much about the subject. Such a child needs resources<br/>\nabout history in order to learn to the degree s/he is curious.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheoretically, it is possible for a kid to spend a great deal of his/her<br/>\ntime studying things -- even school subjects -- and still be an UNschooler.<br/>\nThe difference is in the compulsion and the absence of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, maybe a dentist is the right person to tell a child about the<br/>\nbenefits and joys of clean teeth, and perhaps a few ideas about the<br/>\nconsequences of badly maintained ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike sitting in school, sitting in front of a TV is a passive experience,<br/>\nand the learning is second-hand.
