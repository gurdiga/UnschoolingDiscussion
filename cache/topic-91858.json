I meant symptoms often clear with treament with<br/>\nantibiotics. Borrelia is a screw shaped bacteria that gets into the CNS and<br/>\ncauses a myriad of symptoms, asperger&#39;s and ADD among them. Also MS, Lupus,<br/>\nALS, 100% if Alzheimer&#39;s post mortem testing of brain has shown presence of<br/>\nBorrelia.  I have a wonderful best friend with Aspergers who developed it<br/>\nafter two tick bites. He is such a gift!! I know your daughter is too.<br/>\n I had all symptoms of Parkinson&#39;s two years ago. That is gone with abx<br/>\ntreatment, which continues. Don&#39;t mean to labor the point but on the other<br/>\nhand I can&#39;t undo what I know to be true in many cases. Its a curse to know<br/>\nabout it sometimes, as I feel morally obligated to speak up. Another friend<br/>\nnow stands to gain much of her life back after finding out she didn&#39;t after<br/>\nall have Parkinsons or MS or all the other stuff they were looking for. She<br/>\nhas LD.<br/>\nTerri<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My dh and I have brought her a long way from where she was at three.<br/>\n&gt; Emily is Aspergers will always be Aspergers no matter how well she<br/>\n&gt; blends in with everyone else.  It is a different way of thinking and<br/>\n&gt; seeing the world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They have found the longer you wait to help them the harder it is to<br/>\n&gt; gain ground.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Deb S.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 23<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 13 Mar 2004 01:22:40 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;arcarpenter2003&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:arcarpenter@...\">arcarpenter@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: InRealLife support wasRe: Bedtime and Sleeping<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;queenjane555&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;queenjane555@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hey i am in Michigan...but in Downriver (south of Detroit.)
