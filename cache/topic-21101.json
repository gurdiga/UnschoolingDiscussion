I know it has <br/>\nchemicals and makes me shiver. Then I bought the wet ones and I was <br/>\noverwhelmed by the smell. Every window was open and I woke w/ a very sore <br/>\nthroat this Am after using them yesterday. We have alder wood floors and no <br/>\nstorage so it is tough to find a simple solution. Also floor scrubbing by <br/>\nhand and knee is not easy for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n   NICKI~<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral companies sell a swiffer like piece of equipment with terry cloth that is elasticized to fit over the flat bottom.  For damp mopping just wet and wring out keeping it as wet or dry as desired, to wash the terry, just put in your washing machine.  The Clean Team springs to mind as one of these companies.  There are other companies that sell another elasticized cloth that acts much like a swiffer, although I am unclear on exactly how this piece is cleaned (this might be sold by the &quot;solutions&quot; catalog, among others). You could actually make your own terry cloth pieces for your swiffer (or tuck it into the swiffer holes - if it works, no need to sew).  The Clean Team product has a much larger base, if you have large rooms this might work better.
