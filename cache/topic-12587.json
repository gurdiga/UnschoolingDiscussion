I am not talking about a<br/>\ncircle of people sitting around talking about how they feel or what they<br/>\nhave experienced, but rather people actually feeling and fully expressing<br/>\ntheir feelings. This can be done without blaming someone else for our<br/>\nfeelings. Sometimes if a person just can&#39;t seem to get past blaming we set<br/>\nup what we call a &#39;container&#39;. Then the person can vent and rage and blame<br/>\nuntil they are finished, without anyone interrupting at all. Then the<br/>\nprocess of &#39;cleaning up&#39; needs to happen, especially if the intensity is<br/>\nbetween two people within the circle, say a husband and wife. We need to<br/>\nsometimes be allowed to just vent, but the person receiving the &#39;vent&#39; needs<br/>\nto have enough substance to NOT TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OTHER<br/>\nPERSON&#39;S FEELINGS (not take things personally).<br/>\n<br/>\nSay a wife really needs to express some strong anger at her husband, doesn&#39;t<br/>\nquite know how to do it without sounding like she is blaming him, she can<br/>\nask him to be a container for her. If he feels strong enough to handle her<br/>\nrage without taking it on and then getting defensive - great. If he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nfeel strong enough to do that, the wife may have to pick someone else  to<br/>\ntake his place and he may be present as witness. In the end, whatever the<br/>\nwife is feeling towards her husband has at the core very little to do with<br/>\nher husband, but most likely originated within her own first family. The<br/>\npurpose of circle is to get to the core of things and deal with them at that<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have come to believe that we choose our partners and draw out of our<br/>\npartners the very things we need to heal in ourselves the most. That to me<br/>\nis the main purpose for intimate relationships. The more intimate you get,<br/>\nthe greater the potential for healing for both partners.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have trouble finding a self-healing circle where you are I could give<br/>\nyou some more info about exactly what we do and the tools we use and maybe<br/>\nyou could start your own self-healing circle. To begin with here is a<br/>\nsample:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBEING IN CIRCLE by Sedonia Camu and Joshua Halpen<br/>\n<br/>\nAngeles Arrien says that we need to do four things to make our lives work<br/>\nand they apply to being authentic in the circle as       She says we must<br/>\nshow up, pay attention, tell the truth, and not be attached to the outcome.<br/>\nA circling community allows many opportunities to practice these skills by<br/>\nteaching us to be fully present, to pay attention to our deepest impulses<br/>\nand to be alert and aware of others. We learn to tell the truth so that we<br/>\ncan be deeply known just as we are while discovering more about our- selves.<br/>\nOur commitment needs to be so great to these principles that we do them<br/>\nregardless of the outcome. This means that we &quot;give away&quot; from the very best<br/>\nof ourselves. What makes a circle safe for practising this radically<br/>\nauthentic behaviour, for going through public transformation is the unique<br/>\nquality that arises when there is harmony between the personal and the<br/>\ntranspersonal.<br/>\nThis state of awareness, contained within a circle, generates an energy that<br/>\ncannot come from any other place. This is what has been called in -many<br/>\ntraditions &quot;the Witness&quot;. To be an effective witness requires that we pay<br/>\nattention, not project, interpret, judge, or try to &quot;Fix&quot; the other. There<br/>\nis no room for interference in another&#39;s process. The witness is asked to<br/>\nsit in his or her own circle of Power, pay attention, take responsibility<br/>\nfor what he or she is feeling, and not project his or her experience onto<br/>\nthe other. The only way to really see someone else is to fully own our<br/>\nemotions, feelings, and thoughts.<br/>\nThe need to be really seen is as great as the need for food and shelter, yet<br/>\nmost of us go though life starving for reflection. We al I need to be seen<br/>\nwith eyes filled with love, acceptance, and adoration. There is terrible<br/>\nloneliness and alienation when we feel no one sees, hears, or understands<br/>\nus. This loneliness lingers in circles unless the quality of witnessing is<br/>\npresent.<br/>\nSometimes as part of witnessing, people go through a stage in which they<br/>\nseem to know what they are feeling and they take the certainty that affords<br/>\nthem and assume they know what others are feeling. This is not witnessing.<br/>\nFor instance, sometimes when people feel afraid of another&#39;s pain they will<br/>\nimmediately reach out to hug or stroke them, which stops the process, or<br/>\nthey might come up with a solution to the other person&#39;s dilemma or discount<br/>\nthe other&#39;s feelings by saying it&#39;s not really so bad.<br/>\nAll these are the reactions of someone who is afraid of his or her own pain,<br/>\nor someone who is not being in circle.<br/>\nLearning how to witness is essential because we live in a time when great<br/>\nnumbers of people am beginning to tell their truths. Some of these truths<br/>\nare hard to hear, some involve terrible childhood abuse and betrayal, yet<br/>\nthey must be told and heard. When they are not heard properly the telling is<br/>\nundermined and damage, rather than healing, may result. It can take a long<br/>\ntime to regain the courage to tell the story again.<br/>\nIn the circle process, when people sit and speak from the deepest part of<br/>\nthemselves, no matter how wounded, how much anguish or how many tears, they<br/>\nthen, at that moment, are sitting in their circle of power. They need to be<br/>\nwitnessed, that is, to be respected for their willingness to go so deep and<br/>\nbe so vulnerable. What is required of us as witnesses is to sit in our own<br/>\ncircle of power, owning our own pain and fear, fully being with those<br/>\nfeelings and not projecting them outward.<br/>\nOur stories need to be heard, not fixed. Nobody needs fixing, we are not<br/>\nmachines. All we need is to be heard. We need someone else to know- how hard<br/>\nit was, to know, that we have survived with dignity and that we are not<br/>\nafraid to feel. We as human beings need more than any- thing else to be<br/>\nseen, known, felt, accepted, and loved.<br/>\nWhen people are real in the circle we love them for their process of<br/>\nbecoming whole. We love each other for being who we are, with all our<br/>\nperfections and imperfections. The essence of the process is to validate<br/>\nthat we are living, breathing, dancing, real people who feel pain and fear<br/>\nand make mistakes, while living and caring about each other. The circle form<br/>\ncreates a place for everyone to work, pray, be real and feel at one with<br/>\neach other, all together.<br/>\nBeing in a circle teaches us to respect ourselves and one another. When this<br/>\nhappens we are brought into an experience of immanence and sacredness,<br/>\nmaking us better able to honour the beauty and integrity of the earth. If<br/>\nenough people gather in circle and grapple with their identities within this<br/>\ncontext, it enhances the possibilities for us all. Creative group dynamic is<br/>\nessential if we are going to mobilize healing and create an ecological<br/>\nenvironment for ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know how it goes. There are a lot more books that I would recommend,<br/>\nsuch as &quot;Getting The Love You Want&quot; or &quot;Conscious Loving&quot;, and others. If<br/>\nyou want I will send you a list.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best,<br/>\nNicoletta</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12492,"nextTopicId":12588}}
