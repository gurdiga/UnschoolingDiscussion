Recently I found the movie, called the same, and it was well done, by the BBC who does many wonderful movies.  The movies shows how he spends hours and hours watching the bugs and wildlife on the island learning about how the live.  He meets all kinds of people who teach him more things.  A well meaning friend tells the mother that he needs tutor to be &quot;educate&quot;.  He goes through a few tutors who cannot undertand how to teach this strange little boy who loves all things animal related.  He meets some fascinating people along the way and essentially unschools himself in spite of the well-meaning tutors.  The great thing is that this movie is based on the real life of Gerald Durrell and there are more books by him and about his experiences with animals all over the world if your.  I will say that there are a couple references to sex by Gerry&#39;s older brother and sister but no nudity or suggestive scenes.  The nature photography is wonderful and the boy who plays Gerry is great.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother favorite of my 3 year old son is &quot;Linnea in Monet&#39;s Garden&quot; where Linnea and her elderly neighbor, after reading about and studying Monet&#39;s paintings they decide to visit the actual garden where Monet lived and painted.  The movie alternates between the animated Linnea and her world and the actual garden of Monet.  I thought it was slow moving and that it wouldn&#39;t be interesting to my very active three year old but he loves it!  <br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Denese Kolb <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, December 13, 2002 7:36 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] favorite movies<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Not long ago there was some discussion of favorite movies pertaining to unschooling.
