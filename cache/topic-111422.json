We are <br/>\nmaking small steps I am grateful to say.  Dh&#39;s deployment got <br/>\npostponed for a few days and so we are trying to spend as much time <br/>\nwith him as possible.  So needless to say, there were many of you <br/>\nemailed me off list and I wanted to thank all of you, but have been <br/>\nfocused on dh&#39;s departure and getting things of life in order to <br/>\nhandle it all by myself again for awhile.  I am sorry that I haven&#39;t <br/>\nhad time to reply, but as soon as dh leaves I will try to respond to <br/>\nthose emails.  They were full of sympathy and wonderful advice.  I <br/>\ngreatly appreciate all of you on this list who take the time to think <br/>\nabout our posts and try to give us good suggestions and insight. I <br/>\njust reread this and it sounded kind of redundant, but I guess I am <br/>\njust tired tonight:) <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you to you all,<br/>\n<br/>\nDana</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111416,"nextTopicId":111433}}
