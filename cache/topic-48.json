Gary is a mail carrier and I have always been a stay at home mom. We have 4 sons (Crisstoffer-8/29/86, Andru-1/8/88, Wylliam-8/17/90 & Danyel-12/12/91. We call the 1st and 3rd Criss & BJ and the other to go by their full 1st names) who I have been hs&#39;ing for 4 years as of 6/1.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We take a &quot;freestyle&quot; approach to learning. I would have to say it is more unschooling geared. We have no schedules to follow and the boys choose when and what they do. I do &quot;map out&quot; lessons for them...just for them to have guides.<br/>\n<br/>\n  BJ is &quot;learning gifted&quot;--he has autistic tendancies, is emotionally delayed, is speech delayed & has Oppositional Defiance Disorder (ODD) and mild Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). He is such a bright kid (okay...I am really one sided when it comes to the boys and I think they are all very bright) and works so hard at over-coming the obstacles put in front of him. :-)<br/>\n <br/>\n  We live in West Texas with our 6 dogs, 5 horned lizards and 1 turtle.<br/>\n <br/>\n  I love meeting new friends who hs via email because I don&#39;t know any homeschoolers here. Well, I do but they are all a bit &#39;cliquish&quot; so I have never formed friendships. The only support groups here are very EXclusive and I don&#39;t want the boys around that (plus--they said we couldn&#39;t join since we are Jewish. But, even if we weren&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t join....I want my children around all sorts of people!).<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n  In Friendship, Tracy-Lynn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35,"nextTopicId":51}}
