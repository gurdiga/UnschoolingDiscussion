This sounds pretty drastic.  As trauma is pretty hard to measure and a<br/>\nsoul is a mystical substance about which I don&#39;t know a lot, I&#39;m afraid I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know the answer to that question.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;Live with it&quot;?<br/>\n&gt; If a child goes to another house and the resident child plays in<br/>\n&gt; a different<br/>\n&gt; room, that&#39;s hurtful too.    When parents put friendships above their own<br/>\n&gt; children&#39;s comfort, they&#39;re sending the child a big message.  What of<br/>\n&gt; bringing an older child to facilitate play among those children?<br/>\n&gt; What of the<br/>\n&gt; moms visiting when the kids are with dads?  There are options, and any<br/>\n&gt; friendship that can&#39;t survive six months of phone instead of<br/>\n&gt; in-person visits<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t a friendship worth hurting a child over.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am not explaining myself well.  My seven year old says similar things to<br/>\nhis five year old brother and I wouldn&#39;t think of seperating them for six<br/>\nmonths or even a day.  I tell him as above that if he doesn&#39;t want to be<br/>\naround his brother there are plenty of rooms in the house for him to be in<br/>\nand friends&#39; houses for him to visit if he wants to get away.  The anger<br/>\nusually lasts less than five minutes so I don&#39;t think it is such a big deal.<br/>\nI always listen to what he has to say and I feel like I am respectful of his<br/>\nopinion, but I also want to see my friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has friends that I don&#39;t care for.  I don&#39;t ask him not have them<br/>\nover for six months, I just make sure that I am occupied elsewhere if I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to be around them.  My children even have friends that I am<br/>\nsometimes not too fond of, but I do my best to welcome them.  This is part<br/>\nof sharing life together and I am not going to run my life on the fits of<br/>\nanger of a seven year old or a three year old.  My friend&#39;s twins happen to<br/>\nbe the best friends of my younger son and part of the seven year old&#39;s anger<br/>\ncould be related to this at times.  Whatever.  He gets over it pretty quick<br/>\nand if I kept them apart for long he misses them as much as I do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;As homeschoolers we don&#39;t have an enormous pool of friends to<br/>\n&gt; choose from<br/>\n&gt; and sometimes we have to live with what we have.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t believe this statement to be true.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s all relative.  I know many homeschoolers who feel they have lots of<br/>\nfriends, but to my mind they seem pretty isolated.  We try to have LOTS of<br/>\nfriends.  And the kind of friends that are like siblings that you can fight<br/>\nwith and get angry with and still be friends are the best kind and I value<br/>\nthem a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;I have seen siblings treat<br/>\n&gt; each other in a fashion similar to how you have described the three year<br/>\n&gt; olds&#39; behaviour.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s one thing to be insulted by a sibling who is stuck with your<br/>\n&gt; for life.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s another to be insulted when you&#39;re a guest or a host.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Children don&#39;t necessarily understand the role of guest or host.  If my son<br/>\nis being ungracious as a host I may appologize to the other children.  They<br/>\nnever seem too bothered by it.  I am sure if I made a big deal about his<br/>\nbehaviour they would be more insulted.  But words are what you make of them.<br/>\nMy children do not hold back when they are upset, but by the same token they<br/>\nrecover very quickly also.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Don&#39;t expect much<br/>\n&gt; from any of this though as it will probably pass in a few weeks or so and<br/>\n&gt; you will wonder what all the fuss was about.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If it&#39;s going to pass in a few weeks, better for that to be a<br/>\n&gt; time when the<br/>\n&gt; kids are maturing separately.  Some hurts do last a long, long time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;All the fuss&quot; was about the feelings of humans.  Even three year<br/>\n&gt; olds are<br/>\n&gt; real people.  Their feelings are as big as ours are.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You could be right and I could be wrong.  We are talking about children we<br/>\ndon&#39;t know.  I can only speak from my own experience and my kids tend to<br/>\nhave very short dislikes.  Many children that they disliked at first are now<br/>\ntheir best friends.  I am glad I did not listen to advice like yours when I<br/>\nstill found opportunities to get them together.  As I said, we don&#39;t have a<br/>\nhuge pool of homeschool friends to choose from.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiz</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122926724,"authorName":"Rachel Ann","from":"Rachel Ann &lt;hindar@...&gt;","profile":"salixj","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] 3yo kids","postDate":"1033587677","msgId":45111,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWYwMWMyNmE0YiRhZDM4ZmRjMCQwZTg5NTI0M0BBbm9saWNrRmFtaWx5Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDFhYy45NzQ4NWRhLjJhY2IzZmNmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":45104,"nextInTopic":45125,"prevInTime":45110,"nextInTime":45112,"topicId":44987,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This sounds like a case of *I don t want to play with you* more than *I hate you* Actually it is easy to see how this develops.

A friend&#39;s coming over with whom a child normally likes to play with, but doesn&#39;t today. Yet, maybe mom/dad can&#39;t call it off...they are 1/2hr away, you need a sitter, she needs a sitter, or you simply don&#39;t want to greet them at the door with sorry, she doesn&#39;t want to play.  It is a bit embarrassing.  So mom or dad goes *Oh, you like soandso.* Right?  Something along those lines.  So liking a person must mean you play want to play with them and if you don&#39;t want to play with them you have to not like them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that is my theory.<br/>\n<br/>\nbe well,<br/>\nRachel Ann<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have a friend whose 3yo niece tells her constantly that she doesn&#39;t like <br/>\n  her when she comes to visit.

Like I said, she<br/>\n  has quite a few people that she just doesn&#39;t like, and has never given a<br/>\n  reason for.  My husband is one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My sister doesn&#39;t make her share her toys, and gives her lots of attention<br/>\n  when they are with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n  They are never forced to play together, just, by circumstance, to be in the<br/>\n  same house or at the same activity.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She doesn&#39;t actually seem to be aggravated by anything these people, or this<br/>\n  little boy, are doing.  I&#39;m sure it makes sense to her, but from the outside<br/>\n  it&#39;s very irrational behavior.  For example, we were all walking to a fair<br/>\n  down the street from my house last week.  D told her mother that she wanted<br/>\n  to ride in S&#39;s stroller, which had a second seat available.

We hear lots of &quot;I hate<br/>\nyou&#39;s&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t like you&#39;s&quot; here.  One of the kids says it because it<br/>\ngets a reaction and she truly enjoys reactions.  The other children&#39;s main<br/>\nresponse to her is &quot;So?&quot;.  The other 3yo says it because he is mad and when<br/>\nhe is mad it clouds over his entire being, but only for a few minutes.  The<br/>\nother children&#39;s main response to him is &quot;Why?&quot; which leads to talking and<br/>\nusually laughing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would want to find out exactly what is motivating this little girl.  But<br/>\nif she really didn&#39;t like the little boy, I wouldn&#39;t make her play with him<br/>\nbut I would talk with her about feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45122,"nextTopicId":45044}}
