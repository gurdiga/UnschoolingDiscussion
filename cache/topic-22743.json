The<br/>\n&gt;   lead off guest was Colin Powell, the US Secretary of<br/>\n&gt;   State. Mr. Powell gave an excellent recitation<br/>\n&gt;   relevant to foreign affair matters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Mr. Powell was discussing Mr. Bush&#39;s trip to Europe,<br/>\n&gt;   and was at a point in his recitation covering certain<br/>\n&gt;   concerns regarding Russia, and Russia being requested<br/>\n&gt;   to cooperate with the United States too track down<br/>\n&gt;   lost Nuclear materials and scientists who were<br/>\n&gt;   unaccounted for after the break up of Russia, that now<br/>\n&gt;   may be in the hands of, or in the case of the missing<br/>\n&gt;   scientists, working for adversaries of the USA.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   [Colin Powell] - &quot;Finding the Russian scientists may<br/>\n&gt;   be a problem being that Russia does not have a Social<br/>\n&gt;   Security System, as here in America, that allows us to<br/>\n&gt;   monitor, track down and *capture* an American citizen.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   When he realized the consequences of making<br/>\n&gt;   this disclosure indirectly to the American public, he<br/>\n&gt;   froze for a second, his eyes rolled back as he<br/>\n&gt;   realized what he had said, and then he continued<br/>\n&gt;   without further pause for the rest of the interview. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22741,"nextTopicId":22746}}
