The mother says she told investigators her son<br/>\n&gt;never indicated he didn&#39;t want to nurse and that she would continue to<br/>\n&gt;breastfeed as long as her son wished.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The agency has determined that the child&#39;s living situation constitutes<br/>\n&gt;sexual molestation and risk of harm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Breastfeeding a child is not the issue,&quot; says Deborah Kennedy, DCFS<br/>\n&gt;regional administrator in the central region. &quot;It&#39;s after he has stated<br/>\n&gt;that it is unwanted and she had that information and didn&#39;t indicate she<br/>\n&gt;would halt that activity ... then you have unwanted behavior on his part<br/>\n&gt;and that constitutes abuse.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;She added: &quot;In general, any contact between a sexual organ against the will<br/>\n&gt;of the child constitutes abuse ... because it&#39;s breastfeeding, it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt;sensitive issue.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Monday, final arguments are scheduled in the family court case in<br/>\n&gt;Champaign County, which alleges emotional harm to the boy. The case is to<br/>\n&gt;determine whether the boy was neglected or abused and whether he should<br/>\n&gt;return home to his mother.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The mother says the misguided case is based on society&#39;s narrow ideas about<br/>\n&gt;what constitutes good parenting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Research shows that while rare, it is not unheard of for a child to be<br/>\n&gt;nursing at 6.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Indeed, some pediatricians and child-rearing experts have come to espouse a<br/>\n&gt;revival of old parenting practices, such as extended breastfeeding and<br/>\n&gt;sleeping in the same bed with children혰what some call &quot;co-sleeping.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;DCFS has said that co-sleeping was a factor in its decision to take the<br/>\n&gt;child from the home. DCFS investigators say the woman slept naked with the<br/>\n&gt;boy, which she denies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;They are saying because you&#39;re not practicing Dr. Spock American-style<br/>\n&gt;parenting, you&#39;re a bad mom,&quot; says the petite, feisty woman who was born on<br/>\n&gt;a farm in Downstate Illinois. &quot;What about all those places in the world<br/>\n&gt;where the family sleeps in one room and that is co-sleeping and you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;telling me all those people are maladjusted? It&#39;s cultural bias.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;My son would come to me and ask to nurse,&quot; says the woman. &quot;It&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt;sexual. It was a closeness thing. When he&#39;s ready for it, he will ask to<br/>\n&gt;end breastfeeding.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A complete understanding of the case is elusive, in part because not all<br/>\n&gt;the testimony and evidence is public. The judge in the Champaign County<br/>\n&gt;case, Ann Einhorn, has refused to release any documents, and the state&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;attorney as well as the lawyer representing the boy refuse to discuss the<br/>\n&gt;case.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(The Tribune editorial standard is not to name juveniles in investigations<br/>\n&gt;of sexual abuse, so the names of the child and the mother, who have the<br/>\n&gt;same last name, have been withheld. In interviews, the mother did not<br/>\n&gt;request anonymity.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The woman is the oldest of nine children in a family that she says<br/>\n&gt;practiced co-sleeping.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Her current home is a two-bedroom, second-floor apartment, cluttered with<br/>\n&gt;mounds of clothes, toys, newspapers and boxes of food through which narrow<br/>\n&gt;pathways have been carved. Hoping her son will be home for Christmas, she<br/>\n&gt;has purchased about a dozen presents혰a scooter, a book, the game<br/>\n&gt;Battleship혰which sit stacked on the stairs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The mother works part time at a liquor store and takes continuing education<br/>\n&gt;classes. She never married the child&#39;s father, who now lives in Oregon and<br/>\n&gt;only recently has instigated contact with the boy. He did not return phone<br/>\n&gt;calls from the Tribune.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The mother says she practices child-led weaning, which is supported by the<br/>\n&gt;Schaumburg-based breastfeeding advocacy organization, La Leche League<br/>\n&gt;International, and allows the child to determine when he or she is done<br/>\n&gt;nursing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;My child was weaning himself,&quot; she says, &quot;he was nursing for 10 minutes a<br/>\n&gt;day and on weekends a little more. I don&#39;t think DCFS has any right to be<br/>\n&gt;involved in this decision between me and my child.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Natural or the norm?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;DCFS documents given to the Tribune by the mother indicate that the boy<br/>\n&gt;told a child protection investigator that he no longer wanted to nurse and<br/>\n&gt;had told his mom that; the mother says her son has never communicated that<br/>\n&gt;to her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The documents also indicate that the boy told the investigator that he<br/>\n&gt;still shared a bed with his mother and &quot;sometimes when she does not have<br/>\n&gt;clean clothes, she sleeps naked.&quot; The boy told the investigator that he<br/>\n&gt;always slept in clothes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In an interview, the mother says she has not slept with him naked since he<br/>\n&gt;was around age 3, when she stopped because her son commented that she<br/>\n&gt;should put some clothes on. Though she has since moved, the mother says her<br/>\n&gt;son did not have his own room or his own bed in their former three-bedroom<br/>\n&gt;apartment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Her parenting style and the way she was raised bring to the fore areas of<br/>\n&gt;child-rearing that many of today&#39;s parents keep private because they are<br/>\n&gt;not seen as widely acceptable in society, experts say. While no researcher<br/>\n&gt;supports forcing a child to nurse or co-sleeping naked if that creates<br/>\n&gt;discomfort for a child, they also say that co-sleeping and extended nursing<br/>\n&gt;are both perfectly natural혰it is society that makes them seem unnatural.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Research shows that many women continue to nurse their children well beyond<br/>\n&gt;infancy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Katherine Dettwyler, an associate professor of anthropology and nutrition<br/>\n&gt;at Texas A&M University, conducted a study in the late 1990s on 1,280<br/>\n&gt;children whose parents self-reported information about their breastfeeding<br/>\n&gt;practices. Of the total, 375 children were still nursing at age 4, 212<br/>\n&gt;children were nursing at age 5, and 67 children were nursing at age 6,<br/>\n&gt;according to Dettwyler.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Elizabeth Baldwin, a Miami-based attorney who specializes in breastfeeding<br/>\n&gt;cases and is an adviser to La Leche League International, says &quot;there is<br/>\n&gt;nothing wrong with breastfeeding at age 6.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;You cannot make a child nurse; either the child has the need or does not<br/>\n&gt;have the need,&quot; Baldwin said. &quot;We have sexualized the breast to the point<br/>\n&gt;where we assume that it is a sexual thing rather than a tool for nursing.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Extended breastfeeding and co-sleeping often go hand-in-hand, experts say.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Other countries wouldn&#39;t even know there was a question to be asked about<br/>\n&gt;where should my baby sleep,&quot; said James McKenna, a professor of<br/>\n&gt;anthropology and the director of a mother-baby behavioral sleep lab at the<br/>\n&gt;University of Notre Dame. &quot;It is a recent Western concept engrained in us,<br/>\n&gt;an emphasis on individualism and the idea that it&#39;s a moral principle that<br/>\n&gt;early in life babies and children need to soothe themselves.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;McKenna added: &quot;In our society, we equate nudity with the potential for<br/>\n&gt;sexuality. It may not be a sexual act at all in the minds of participants;<br/>\n&gt;it is externally influenced viewpoints that make it so.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He warned, however, that not all co-sleeping arrangements are necessarily<br/>\n&gt;healthy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;The benefit of any kind of social behavior is determined by the context in<br/>\n&gt;which it occurs,&quot; McKenna said. &quot;In a healthy human family, sleeping<br/>\n&gt;arrangements can enhance that which is already good, or it could be the<br/>\n&gt;case sleeping arrangements can enhance that which is already bad.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Focus on boy&#39;s reaction<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Champaign case is similar to혰but also critically different from혰a<br/>\n&gt;celebrated case out of New York state in 1991. In that case Denise<br/>\n&gt;Periggo&#39;s 3-year-old daughter Cherlyn was taken from her because Periggo<br/>\n&gt;had strong feelings of sexual arousal when breastfeeding.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In the Champaign case, experts are divided on how the nursing was affecting<br/>\n&gt;the boy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A report by Champaign forensic psychologist Dr. Marty Traver,who evaluated<br/>\n&gt;the boy upon referral from Judge Einhorn, described an alert, relaxed child<br/>\n&gt;who expressed ambivalence about nursing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;It is clear that [the boy] has suffered some emotional problems as a<br/>\n&gt;result of his extended nursing,&quot; Traver wrote. &quot;Those problems however do<br/>\n&gt;not appear to rise to the level of abuse unless there is evidence that [the<br/>\n&gt;boy&#39;s] mother nursed him for her own gratification.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;The primary detriment from extended nursing in this case, was that [the<br/>\n&gt;boy] was ashamed of doing so and did not feel socially appropriate in doing<br/>\n&gt;so,&quot; Traver&#39;s report states.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;A parent must weigh the damage done by participating in something society<br/>\n&gt;does not approve of against the positive effects and advantages of<br/>\n&gt;continuing to do so. In this case, as in many others, the parent and child<br/>\n&gt;had to keep the continuing breastfeeding a secret because of societal<br/>\n&gt;disapproval. This sets the child up to keep other secrets that he cannot<br/>\n&gt;yet understand,&quot; the report stated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Traver also said it was not appropriate for the boy to continue to sleep<br/>\n&gt;with his mother. &quot;At this age, it would be psychologically harmful for him<br/>\n&gt;to be in his mother&#39;s presence when she is nude. ... (The boy) must learn<br/>\n&gt;to sleep in his own bed and soothe himself to sleep.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But a report by Kate McDougall, a Catholic Social Service social worker who<br/>\n&gt;is counseling the mother and child, concluded that while the mother&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&quot;parenting style may be considered somewhat permissive, this therapist does<br/>\n&gt;not have concerns about [the boy&#39;s] safety while in her care.&quot; McDougall<br/>\n&gt;added that she saw no evidence of any abuse in the relationship.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The boy &quot;has come to feel ashamed and guilty about breastfeeding as a<br/>\n&gt;result of his being removed from his mother&#39;s care due to their nursing.<br/>\n&gt;This therapist has concerns that these feelings of shame and guilt will be<br/>\n&gt;exacerbated by further separation,&quot; McDougall wrote in a clinical<br/>\n&gt;assessment report.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;McDougall also stated in her report that she had no concerns about the two<br/>\n&gt;sleeping in the same bed and recommended the boy be returned home.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The woman&#39;s public defender, David DeThorne, said Traver&#39;s testimony stated<br/>\n&gt;that the child was embarrassed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;That shouldn&#39;t be a reason the state should get involved,&quot; DeThorne said.<br/>\n&gt;&quot;She was doing something to him outside the norm, and [perhaps] he didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;want to혰that is open to dispute as well.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He added: &quot;Parents should be allowed to make decisions that might be out of<br/>\n&gt;the norm. Most parents don&#39;t breastfeed at age of 6, but it doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s wrong for the child.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Countered DCFS spokeswoman Martha Allen: &quot;There is a problem when the<br/>\n&gt;mother is sleeping naked with a 6-year-old; we live in America and we have<br/>\n&gt;our norms too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;This is a case that not just DCFS but the state&#39;s attorney and judge<br/>\n&gt;determined was inappropriate and was a form of abuse.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;It&#39;s inappropriate for a mother to be breastfeeding a child at 6 years old<br/>\n&gt;and to be sleeping naked with him. The reason DCFS found it an issue was<br/>\n&gt;we&#39;re looking at the area of sexual abuse when we say molestation. There is<br/>\n&gt;risk of actual and emotional abuse. We are in the realm of sexual abuse;<br/>\n&gt;that is the reason that we took the child out of the mother&#39;s care.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On Monday, Judge Einhorn will hear final arguments from both sides in the<br/>\n&gt;Champaign County case. Einhorn may decide on Monday, or she could wait<br/>\n&gt;until a later date, to determine whether the boy was neglected or abused.<br/>\n&gt;If her determination is that the child was abused, another hearing will be<br/>\n&gt;held to decide whether the child can go home or not, and to determine a<br/>\n&gt;plan for the mother to get her son back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Though she wants her son back, the mother also refuses to compromise her<br/>\n&gt;methods.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;They took my son because I&#39;m not following the DCFS cookbook on raising a<br/>\n&gt;kid,&quot; she says. &quot;It&#39;s so outrageous, they need to admit they made a mistake<br/>\n&gt;and drop it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Love <br/>\n  Pauline<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of photos of us having fun at home in sunny Sydney<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=898945&a=6546029&pw=23631\">http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=898945&a=6546029&pw=23631</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"2zWrvh3dATBx1P-dt5c5WuCs_EGHKn1EikEf8bnejNPIKvz-VbRm-HKGwzryymsZpwSPoYF_smBytKfQuXidIVXlfR2tdOMmhHh-kHCZksXmPny1Nw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] in the news","postDate":"976583860","msgId":14497,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBMzU3Q0I0LjEwMzExLjhEMEFGN0Bsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMGIwMWMwNjM4NCQ3Y2MwZmZmMCQwMTAwMDA1YUBjYW1lbG90Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDEwMWMwNjM4MyQwYTU1NDU4MCQzYjhmM2VhNkB3dnVzLm9yZz4="},"prevInTopic":14493,"nextInTopic":14502,"prevInTime":14496,"nextInTime":14498,"topicId":14482,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"naturalweaners, an egroup, is for those intersted/needing support in child-led weaning, obviously!
