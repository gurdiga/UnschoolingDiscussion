I&#39;m Kyle and my wife is Paula.  We have two children, Steven<br/>\n13<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Kayla 9&gt;     Being the primary domestic engineer for the past six<br/>\n&gt; &gt; years I would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; love to here from any other homedads if there are any of you out<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kyle<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi Kyle,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My name is Joshua and my wife is Selina.  We have 2 boys, Jordan (8) and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Daylon (just about 6).  I too am the &quot;primary domestic engineer&quot; in our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; household.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wow,  I&#39;m impressed two Dads who not only stay home as the<br/>\n&gt; primary domestic engineers [I love that] but also homeschool!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now my partner wonders what you share with your children.  He<br/>\n&gt; seems to have a problem with Dads staying at home with the kids<br/>\n&gt; as he wonders what example they are setting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In defense of you guys,  I asked him what example his Mother<br/>\n&gt; showed him and pointed out that all his strong traits [he&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; scrounge] and interests were fostered by his Mother and what she<br/>\n&gt; did.  Way back when he was a child his Mother was very frugal,<br/>\n&gt; she was divorced but never took a job, instead she rented rooms<br/>\n&gt; and lived simply.  This rubbed off on Dick and he worked many<br/>\n&gt; hours as a teen, was in the marines for three years during the<br/>\n&gt; Korean thing, and saved most of his money and had a sizeable<br/>\n&gt; sum to put down as a deposit on the farm.   She was a keen<br/>\n&gt; gardener and knew the benefits of adding organic matter to the<br/>\n&gt; sandy soil to improve it.  This has turned Dick into an organic<br/>\n&gt; fanatic, you should see the size of our compost pile...  we even<br/>\n&gt; composted the neighbours dead cow!!   She was very interested in<br/>\n&gt; birds and at an early age Dick learned all he could about birds in<br/>\n&gt; an unschooled way.   Also his Mother was a very tidy person, and<br/>\n&gt; while this didn&#39;t rub off onto him the desire for order did, making for<br/>\n&gt; some frustrations, as sometimes we have a bit too much to do<br/>\n&gt; here for the place to be kept orderly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So hopefully he may now look at the role of stay-at-home parents<br/>\n&gt; of any gender as the most important job there is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -  Sue   -<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Winona Farm in Minnesota Welcomes Unschoolers All Year Round<br/>\n&gt; My website:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e\">http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e</a><br/>\n&gt; Farm website:    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homepage.rconnect.com/winfarm\">http://homepage.rconnect.com/winfarm</a><br/>\n&gt; Farm newsletter: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;To believe in something, and not to live it, is to be dishonest.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; -Mahatma Gandhi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!<br/>\n&gt; 1.

It seems to me that &quot;society&quot;<br/>\npresents us with two acceptable schemes for supporting a family.<br/>\n    1.  Dad works and mom stays home.<br/>\n    2.  (more recently) Both parents work, and use PSing as daycare.<br/>\nIt seems to me the time is ripe for a new a new scheme where both parents<br/>\ncontribute financially, but niether has to work so much that them can not<br/>\nalso contribute to the &quot;domestic engineering&quot; aspects of life.  Eventually I<br/>\nhope to create that kind of life... but for now my wife is full-time(+).<br/>\nThe opposite extreme...<br/>\n  As to the example i set... I also think it is important for my sons to<br/>\nhave an image of their father as a &quot;contributor&quot; so I emphasize the value in<br/>\nthe work I do do- cooking, cleaning, etc... also they have seen me do lots<br/>\nof different jobs including last summer and this summer upcoming when my<br/>\nwife will take 2 months of and I will work planting trees for 3 months.<br/>\nLast summer the highlight of thier summer was when they camped out in the<br/>\ntreeplanting camp where I was working for 2 weeks...

I<br/>\ncan&#39;t imaging it any more.  Not after I have experienced the difference in<br/>\nthe depth of my connection to them.
