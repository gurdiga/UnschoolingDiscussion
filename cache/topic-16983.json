Can&#39;t remember if I made an intro yet <br/>\nso, I am Nicki SAHM to Zoe who will be 5 in May. Basically she plays all day <br/>\nw/ her horse,dinosaurs,cats,and dogs, and people. We also take care of the <br/>\nanimals around here;dogs,horses,and a cat. We clean,cook,and do errands. We <br/>\nhit the library once a week hopefully on story day b/c they bring in <br/>\nsomething like a snake or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Our &quot;educational&quot; stuff comes in when she asks questions or while reading <br/>\nto her. Zoe has begun writing like a mad woman all on her own accord. She <br/>\ncopies words and asks how to spell things constantly. Even moping the other <br/>\nday she was writing our letters. Also vet visits and farrier visits are <br/>\nalways an education. We play some games and do puzzles too. Zoe occasionally <br/>\ndoes a workbook type activity when it strikes her. We receive Brighter Vision <br/>\npackages once a month and they send a workbook. I don&#39;t buy them, not my <br/>\nstyle.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Basically I think that sums it up for us. She does watch a video or 2 a <br/>\nday but doesn&#39;t actually pay attention to it, she seems to use it as <br/>\nbackground noise. I wish I could get her to use the stereo instead.

The copyright on it is 1996,<br/>\n&gt; but I don&#39;t think that makes it any less worthwhile.  Retail on it is $100....<br/>\n&gt; it is marked $29.95.  With my discount card, it was only $21.18 including tax.<br/>\n&gt; I am guessing this is chain-wide, since a neighbor bought one at a different<br/>\n&gt; B&N than the one I went to today.
