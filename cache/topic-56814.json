I could ALWAYS be wrong<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, having a Jr in high school myself, I know where your coming from.  ( <br/>\nalthough I dont homeschool him)  My understanding is that grade transcripts ( <br/>\nfrom high school or home school) along with SAT scores are a BIG <br/>\nconsideration in college acceptance.  Extracurriulcar activiites  (or <br/>\ncommunity involvement ) and essays are also a big  determinant to being <br/>\naccepted into college.   So, if he wants to score decently on his SATS, he <br/>\nwill need to learn the math.   800 being a perfect score in math, I think a <br/>\n500 would be decent, but certainly not outstanding.   A lot probably depends <br/>\non where he wants to go to college and what he wants to study.  Maybe check <br/>\nout some college requirements from some colleges hes interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Week four/ Needing support","postDate":"1043774508","msgId":56839,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMTI4MTcyMTQ4LjcwOTE0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDZjLjI5NDdhZjhkLjJiNjgwMDA4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":56831,"nextInTopic":56846,"prevInTime":56838,"nextInTime":56840,"topicId":56814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I also know that even without a college degree, let alone the high school classes,  he could do computer work and movie work.
