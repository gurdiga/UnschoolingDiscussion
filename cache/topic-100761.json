Last night was very cold so we didn&#39;t say out long and<br/>\nthe sky was patchy with clouds so we weren&#39;t getting great views.  But<br/>\nthis morning we were up at four and it was foggy and spooky but just over<br/>\nhead the a little circle of sky was clear and bright and we saw three<br/>\nshooting stars per minute.   It was lovely! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also heard a small? group of cranes flying over and the swans have<br/>\nbeen straggling past for the last week.  If you&#39;re in the flyway and your<br/>\neyes are skyward, make sure your mouths are closed. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99801,"nextTopicId":100739}}
