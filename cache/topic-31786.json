I think reading is a basic skill for survival in this society. My kid<br/>\nis almost six and he is just starting to read. We do phonics stuff and sound<br/>\ngames every day *at his request*. But even if he weren&#39;t into it, I&#39;d<br/>\nstart &quot;making him&quot; at a later age. Not at the age he is now, but certainly<br/>\nby 10 or so. Yup, you betcha I would! It is the one thing I feel strongly<br/>\nthat he has to learn. Years ago, it was illegal for my ancestors to learn<br/>\nhow to read (we are African American) in this country. I feel it would be<br/>\na slap in the face for all their struggles for me to neglect this one<br/>\naspect of his upbringing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLynn***<br/>\n<br/>\nNow this is the kind of thinking that just begs for a response along the<br/>\nlines of unschooling!  I&#39;ll just ask,  Lynn,  you&#39;re willing to give up<br/>\nunschooling if your child can&#39;t read by age 10?  I&#39;m wondering whether you<br/>\nfully understand it then.  And I won&#39;t speak for Tia,  but she has commented<br/>\nmany times that her experience of intervening with her son seemed to make<br/>\nthings worse in their relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nI truly understand your dilemma,  for I have experienced what you are simply<br/>\ntalking about as a possible situation.  Let me share a bit of my experience.<br/>\nSince we moved away from the school track for our family (my oldest had<br/>\nattended kindergarten and two yrs of preschool),  I explored aspects of<br/>\neducating our children at home and found that unschooling resonated as the<br/>\nmost genuine way to allow my children to grow.<br/>\n    When my very intelligent dd wasn&#39;t reading by the end of &#39;first grade&#39;,<br/>\nI worried.  She had even forgotten the sight words she had memorized in<br/>\nkindergarten.  All the veteran homeschoolers advised me to take a deep breat<br/>\nh and be patient.  I had to trusyt a bunch of people I&#39;d never met in<br/>\nperson?  Well,  I did.  For several months.  And as dd did NOT &#39;take off&#39; in<br/>\nher reading,  my patience left me.  I once again struggled to &#39;let go.  A<br/>\ndiscussion came up here ...about whether or not it&#39;s ok for a parent to<br/>\n&#39;just let them grow up illiterate&#39;.  But again,  the those who had older<br/>\nchildren,  children who learned to read &#39;later&#39;,  others coping with the<br/>\nsame circumstance all recommended being patient.   I went up and down this<br/>\nroller coaster....though the hills and valleys became less and less<br/>\npronounced.<br/>\n    Finally,  about a year ago,  I *truly got it*!!!  I had *really* missed<br/>\nthe point of unschooling in regard to reading!  All along,  I was pushing dd<br/>\ninto word games, shaming her at times (I didn&#39;t consciously intend to...I<br/>\nwas ashamed it camed out that way).  In my roller coaster ride,  I was still<br/>\npushing her...only it became more subtle usually.  Or I&#39;d think...ok,  I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen patient for 6-7 months,  and that hasn&#39;t &#39;worked&#39; (meaning it didn&#39;t<br/>\nget me what *I* wanted - her to read AND enjoy it!)<br/>\n    Intead of allowing her the freedom to learn when,  how,  as much as SHE<br/>\nchose,  I was trying to get her to meet MY expectations.  When she was 8,<br/>\ndh and I even devised a *plan* to have her tested if she couldn&#39;t read by<br/>\nage 9.  Then it was,  we&#39;ll start a stringent structured program by age 9;<br/>\nthen it was....maybe I&#39;m not handling this right,  maybe we should pay a<br/>\ntutor.  Well, all this didn&#39;t settle well with me.  And whenever it came up,<br/>\ndd felt like she had disappointed me,  like a failure.  She was stressed and<br/>\ntense about reading and &#39;tried&#39; to do it for me....yet became increasingly<br/>\nresistant.<br/>\n    When I examined this situation more closely,  I realized I had some<br/>\nmajor de-schooling to do of my own thinking.  I had to examine how<br/>\nmainstream ideas had infiltrated my thinking about how it&#39;s my *job* to make<br/>\nsure she knows certain things.<br/>\n    And your post almost exactly states my thinking on it.<br/>\nMaybe you&#39;ll not be able to understand unless you go through it.  But I was<br/>\nwrong in my attitude and it only harmed my dd.  She was not truly allowed<br/>\nthe freedom she neede in this area (i.e., NOT unschooling) until I had this<br/>\nbreakthrough in my thinking and attitude.<br/>\n    I need to go now......I hope you can look at this with an open mind!<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5047879,"authorName":"Joseph Fuerst","from":"&quot;Joseph Fuerst&quot; &lt;fuerst@...&gt;","profile":"jsf491","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1784","postDate":"1012401834","msgId":31801,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGYwMWMxYTk5YyQ4YTdlMjY0MCRlYjg5ODUwYUBwYXZpbGlvbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwMTIzMjUxNzQuNzA0LjQ5NDIyLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":31791,"nextInTopic":31802,"prevInTime":31800,"nextInTime":31802,"topicId":31786,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**When I say I am done talking about him because I think most of you have heard enough, I m told that I should explain again.
