I suppose its been hashed out before and I hadn&#39;t seen it.<br/>\n <br/>\nI really think that Marsh misses a huge point, a child&#39;s/baby&#39;s/toddler&#39;s brain does grow and will flourish with stimulation, but,  who are we know where and how their individual brains will flourish?        The whole lumping all children into one &#39;type&#39; is so limited.   It seems to me that his program would fit right in with alot of schoolish ideas.  Kind-of, crank the kids out on a conveyor belt thing. <br/>\n <br/>\nI always read to my babys/toddlers but it was more of a together time and nurturing time.  Looking at colorful pictures,  and enjoying each other.   Who knows if they really benefited from the reading or if it was just being held.  And I can&#39;t even imagine actually teaching a 16 month old how to read!?!     My kids would have been soooo  out of there.   They had cupboards to explore, plants to look at, toys to play with....and so on.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI guess the problem with society,  and many people on this list have said it, is that people do see what works for some people and then it is the quick fix.   They think that this particular act, class, process will make their child successful.  So often, patience and nurturing is totally forgotten or not even brought up as a viable option in parenting.  Unfortunately, these are not strong suits in main stream society,   it makes me sad.   <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ll stop now,<br/>\n <br/>\nKelli<br/>\n <br/>\n Peggy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:peggy@...\">peggy@...</a>&gt; wrote: <br/>\nFrom: Helen Hegener &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM-Editor@...\">HEM-Editor@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &quot;If you would look at my web page on <br/>\n&gt; this---www.educationbeginsatbirth.com---you will learn more about it <br/>\n&gt; and me at the bio section.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I did take a look at Marsh&#39;s site, and it&#39;s interesting reading.
