I am not sure how he would take it........<br/>\nHe sees this happy confident independant helpful daughter, a GREAT <br/>\nchange from the sad argumentative child that she used to be, and <br/>\ncomments how good h/s is for her.<br/>\nI think I might just leave it like that !!!!!<br/>\nMarianne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13775,"nextTopicId":13779}}
