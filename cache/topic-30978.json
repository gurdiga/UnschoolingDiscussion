I have 5 kids and they all<br/>\norganize their lives differently.  I don&#39;t think one has better<br/>\norganizational skills than another, only that they organize the world<br/>\ndifferently.  My oldest has very obvious and easily recognizable structure<br/>\nto her life, her room, her &quot;stuff&quot; in general.  My next oldest organizes<br/>\nbased on completely different criteria.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I start feeling that the kids aren&#39;t &quot;organized&quot;, i.e. can&#39;t find their<br/>\nshoes, late for gymnastics, etc., it usually reflects more of a difference<br/>\nin priorities rather than in skills.  My 8yo has no trouble whatsoever<br/>\nremembering where his BB gun is or his hotwheels, but can never find his<br/>\nboots to go feed the rabbits.  Go figure.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut based on what you wrote, I would definitely drop it with the oldest<br/>\ncompletely, unless she is specifically asking you for help.  If something<br/>\nshe is doing is interfering with you, like making you late, talk with her<br/>\nabout what could happen differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30752,"nextTopicId":30981}}
