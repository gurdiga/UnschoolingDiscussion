Is this possible? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia, my daughter who just turned 3 had a very mild case of cradle cap until <br/>\nafter she was 2 years old.  She had scales right on her scalp and her hair <br/>\nnever grew long until she was almost 2 1/2.  I always shampooed normally <br/>\nexcept I used a soft scalp sponge (the one the hospital gave me) when <br/>\nshampooing.  When she was about 2 I started combing her hair when it was wet <br/>\nand soapy and the cradle cap would start coming off in little clumps.  I was <br/>\nalways very gentle and only combed a little bit as my dd&#39;s head would get <br/>\nvery red if it was messed with too much.  It&#39;s funny to look back now -- her <br/>\nhair started growing better after the cradle cap was gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle in DE</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14428,"nextTopicId":14434}}
