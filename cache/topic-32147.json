My children have continued to learn,<br/>\nday after day, without any structured lessons.  My 8yo is picking up<br/>\nmultiplication on his own.  My 14yo has studied algebra, chemistry and<br/>\nAmerican and Texas history on his own initiative.  No workbooks - just<br/>\nplenty of access to the library, to the Internet, to Mom and Dad, and to<br/>\nother adults who will answer his questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead some of John Holt&#39;s books.  Read this article that was in the Houston<br/>\nChronicle yesterday.   The author, Crispin Sartwell, is chairman of<br/>\nhumanities and sciences at the Maryland Institute<br/>\nCollege of Art in Baltimore:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1262000\">http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1262000</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDeschool yourself.   Know that the educational system doesn&#39;t work, so that<br/>\ncopying it won&#39;t work at home either.  People learn naturally because that&#39;s<br/>\nwhat Nature intends for them to do.  Perhaps they won&#39;t learn the same<br/>\nthings kids at school are learning -  but they&#39;ll be able to learn them, at<br/>\nany time they become important.  An education is not just a<br/>\ngovernment-mandated set of classes on specific subjects.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe longer we unschool, the happier we are with it.  DH thought it would<br/>\nwork for our first child, who is intellectually gifted, but didn&#39;t expect it<br/>\nto work for our second, who is intellectually average.  It works well for<br/>\nboth of them.  It&#39;s the &quot;average&quot; kid who&#39;s figuring out multiplication and<br/>\ndivision on his own, with Legos and cookies and video games.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt works!

No formal learning.<br/>\nPretend it&#39;s summer vacation. Unschooling can&#39;t be done part time.
