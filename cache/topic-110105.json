VERY high-pressure <br/>\nenlightenment.    And there&#39;s a fullpage ad of someone&#39;s very vague claims, but two <br/>\nphrases seemed to match recent discussions here:<br/>\n&quot;If you believe physical death to be your destiny, why waste another thought <br/>\nabout your health and welfare? However, if you have even the slightest hint in <br/>\nyour heart that you were made to liave forever, then your health matters.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor $69.97 plus $10 postage, he&#39;ll tell you all about it, whatever &quot;it&quot; is.   <br/>\nAnd will send extra audio CDs worth BIG bucks (in his eternal universe) and <br/>\nsayd &quot;Giving you three albums for free is like laying sixteen $20 bills on the <br/>\ntable and saying &#39;Take it as a gift!&#39;&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo cool.... He just gave me sixteen $20 bills, so sending him $70 bucks is <br/>\nCHEAP!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m feeling more enlightened already.   But that was an advertisement, not an <br/>\narticle.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it matter, in a magazine, what&#39;s ad and what&#39;s article?   <br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, I looked the guy up and one website that was outing him said he had <br/>\nads in a Kung Fu magazine and is basically selling magnets.   Magnets to help <br/>\nyou live longer?   Forever?   This one seemed to lean toward herbs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre magnets and herbs &quot;enlightenment&quot;?    Is living vaguely longer than you <br/>\nwould if you were to die &quot;enlightenment&quot;?   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think enlightenment is when your thoughts are clearer and you&#39;re not so <br/>\nmuch in the dark.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF (big if) this guy DOES have information that would help people not to age, <br/>\nand to feel better, and if were very enlightened, wouldn&#39;t he maybe be giving <br/>\nthat away free for nothing?<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think people should do good things in their lives, and consider moods <br/>\nand posture and exercise and remember to drink water and to look at the sky and <br/>\nthe breathe.   Yoga can be cool.   Meditation can be wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of those things will give you eternal life, nor even maybe a longer <br/>\nlife.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best any of them can do is give you a better self.   If your real self is <br/>\nbetter, then now is better and later isn&#39;t going to matter so much (though <br/>\nlater is quite likely to be better if you figure out how to make now better, <br/>\nbecause if you can make today good, you can make EVERY day better).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110103,"nextTopicId":2025}}
