You&#39;re right - even if my friend<br/>\nhad pushed her son to learn the math facts isn&#39;t a guarantee that he would<br/>\nhave... and he can learn them now if he really wanted to.  I think I&#39;ll<br/>\nkeep treating math as &quot;fun&quot; - board games, math in real life applications,<br/>\netc.... and on the rare occasion that she does ask for math worksheets,<br/>\nI&#39;ll give them to her...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Come to think of it I think your right, but it looks so good on paper.LOL<br/>\n&gt;I really love to have those nice little papers to show daddy that we are <br/>\n&gt;learning here in hs land. Unschooling is so hard to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know the feeling - papers would be easy!  At least 3 times a week, my dh<br/>\nstill asks my 9yo dd &quot;did you do math today?&quot; and my 6yo ds &quot;did you do your<br/>\nletters and numbers today?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Art - when my dd was young, we would set her up with all her artwork<br/>\naround her - on the walls, floor, etc. and take one picture of all of it <br/>\ntogether... now that we need it for our homeschooling portfolio, I take a <br/>\nphoto of each individual piece of art, and put the photo in our portfolio.<br/>\nIt takes up a lot less space! We also let my dd and ds keep their favorite<br/>\nworks of art, and hang them up in their bedrooms. Usually by the time my 6yo<br/>\nds has a new piece, he&#39;s ready to take down the old one.  My dd is a little<br/>\nmore sentimental, so I usually put them in a pile and get rid of the less-<br/>\nthan-favorite ones when she&#39;s unaware (sneaky, I know, but before you know<br/>\nit, I&#39;d need a storage unit for all the artwork!).  I keep the favorites<br/>\nin a pile for her scrapbook - it&#39;s actually all in a drawer right now, as<br/>\nI haven&#39;t actually put anything in a scrapbook... but the drawer is filling,<br/>\nso I&#39;ll have to do it soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again all!<br/>\nRobin<br/>\nFL<br/>\n:-)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4668,"nextTopicId":4724}}
