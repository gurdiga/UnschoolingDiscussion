In our situation, its not that Darin <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to understand, its that it is a hard concept for him to wrap his <br/>\nmind around. And maybe, that is the same for your dh, but he doesn&#39;t know how <br/>\nto express his feelings of confusion.? I would suggest a few things. One, get <br/>\nsome of the tapes from the recent hs conference in California. This will <br/>\nenable him to hear other people besides you talking or reading to him about <br/>\nunschooling, life, kids, loving family relationships... Two, offer to him <br/>\nwhat I have just offered to Darin. <br/>\n<br/>\nI took Darin to and from work today because the kids and I needed the car. <br/>\nWhile we were in the car together, we listened to one of the tapes I just <br/>\ngot. This evening he and I were doing the same thing on the way over to the <br/>\ngrocery store and he was making a few observations about some of the things <br/>\nSandra was saying in the talk we were listening to. And then he asked if she <br/>\nwas famous. &lt;g&gt; I said well, yes I suppose so, in homeschooling circles. I <br/>\ntook this as an opening to talk some and asked if he had something he wanted <br/>\nto know. Nothing doing. &lt;g&gt; (*Sandra, Darin thinks you are some kinda famous <br/>\nhomeschooling expert! Go figgure!*) So I said if he had a question and wanted <br/>\nto hear someone else&#39;s response or ideas besides mine he should post the <br/>\nquestion here. He seemed really receptive to that. He said that yes, he might <br/>\nhave a few things he would like to hear others take on. So, I am hoping that <br/>\nhe will post here soon. I think it will really help. Maybe you could offer <br/>\nthat same thing for your dh. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":123062302,"authorName":"Mica","from":"&quot;Mica&quot; &lt;ghal9720@...&gt;","profile":"micaherself","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] The reluctant husband","postDate":"1031371383","msgId":43186,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDcwMWMyNTYyMyQ3OWJkMDRmMCRkMjg0MzNjYkBoYWxsYW0+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxMjEwMWMyNTRlMCQ1NjFjNTRlMCQ5NzJhMDM0MEBFbGlzc2FKQz4="},"prevInTopic":42918,"nextInTopic":43198,"prevInTime":43185,"nextInTime":43187,"topicId":42825,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Of course...
