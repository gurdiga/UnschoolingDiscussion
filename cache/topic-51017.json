The students are serious about the work and why they are there. Maybe it was because I waited 10 years to go to school but I found the college English classes much more difficult than high school English. But my favorite class was English 1102. There were 6 female students and 1 male teacher that was about 5 years older than me. We all sat in a circle in class and discussed the stories and poems we read. Then we had to write a paper on certain stories or mix similar themes together.
