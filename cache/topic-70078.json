We talk about why other couples do what they do, <br/>\nwhy someone <br/>\n&gt; got divorced, whether someone seems to be being a good boyfriend or <br/>\nnot (of <br/>\n&gt; the adults around them, or older teens).  They talk to us about <br/>\nthings <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;ve seen and heard when they were at other people&#39;s houses.   <br/>\nWe discuss <br/>\n&gt; pregnancies and miscarriages with them.

We had a male friend of hers who is somewhere in <br/>\nthe nine <br/>\n&gt; to eleven year range, I&#39;m not sure here overnight, because his mom <br/>\nwasn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; feeling well.  Holly said &quot;I&#39;ll sleep with him in the library,&quot; and <br/>\nI said <br/>\n&gt; okay.  I also suggested they could put a futon on the floor in her <br/>\nroom if <br/>\n&gt; they wanted to, becuase it was a very windy night, and that library <br/>\nhas a <br/>\n&gt; whistly window and a sometimes-rattly (sometimes blows right open) <br/>\ndoor on <br/>\n&gt; the deck.  It&#39;s up high.  But they decided to sleep on futons in <br/>\nthere, so I <br/>\n&gt; helped them set it up and I locked the door with a deadbolt so it <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; blow open.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The preparations had all to do with comfort and a peaceful night, <br/>\nnot about <br/>\n&gt; keeping a girl away from a boy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When we kept a family of kids, a girl and her two brothers, all <br/>\nfour made <br/>\n&gt; beds up there, and I didn&#39;t worry a bit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It often happened with the boys (still does) that they have mixed <br/>\ngroups of <br/>\n&gt; kids from out of town come for a concert or whatever and stay <br/>\nover.  They <br/>\n&gt; sleep just wherever, however.  So our kids do NOT have the <br/>\nexpectation that <br/>\n&gt; if there are mixed groups that there will or should be even <br/>\nKISSING, let <br/>\n&gt; alone sex.  There is no long-awaited charge for them.  Sleeping is <br/>\nsleeping.  <br/>\n&gt; Kirby has a queen-sized bed and a futon on the floor in his room.  <br/>\nWe have a <br/>\n&gt; neighbor, Joey, who pretty much lives in Kirby&#39;s room.  Last time <br/>\nSadie was <br/>\n&gt; over (18, Amazon-queen type, unschooled, in college) she just slept <br/>\non <br/>\n&gt; Kirby&#39;s bed with him.  Separate covers, but not because anybody <br/>\nsaid so.  She <br/>\n&gt; just fell asleep where she was, and it was no big deal.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At our house, because we have NEVER made a big deal about anyone <br/>\nbeing a girl <br/>\n&gt; or a boy, and have not acted nervous or said who couldn&#39;t sleep or <br/>\nbe or sit <br/>\n&gt; or ride where, the kids are calm and mature.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The only problem kid has been a schooled kid, only child, who had a <br/>\ncrush on <br/>\n&gt; a friend of my niece, and when the Espanola homeschooler crowd <br/>\nwould come <br/>\n&gt; over, he always had to come over too, and sit with the girls, and <br/>\ntouch them <br/>\n&gt; too much, and make too much sexual-tension commentary, and <br/>\ngenerally be an <br/>\n&gt; irritating traditional schoolboy.    I would just make loud general <br/>\ncomments <br/>\n&gt; like &quot;If Eric&#39;s bothering you, just tell him to go sleep in the <br/>\nden,&quot; or &quot;If <br/>\n&gt; Eric&#39;s a problem, we can send him home.&quot;  (He has a car and lives <br/>\none mile <br/>\n&gt; away.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This came up once (on this list or somewhere else, the forum maybe) <br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; someone new to unschooling and homeschooling and new to kids being <br/>\nopen and <br/>\n&gt; honest got VERY shrill about it.  Someone had asked about a mixed-<br/>\ngender <br/>\n&gt; sleepover of eight or nine year olds, I think.  Several of us said <br/>\nwe saw no <br/>\n&gt; problem, and this new mom kinda went OFF on us that if we thought <br/>\nthat kids <br/>\n&gt; had ever slept in the same room at our house and NOT had sex that <br/>\nwe were <br/>\n&gt; fooling ourselves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It was fascinating to see how strongly SHE obviously thought it was <br/>\n&gt; inevitable, or required, that if you can reach each other in the <br/>\ndark you&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; going to screw like bunnies.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you could all have seen the looks on my kids&#39; faces when I read <br/>\nthem her <br/>\n&gt; post, you would all KNOW volumes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kirby seems probably to have &quot;done it&quot; (I didn&#39;t ask straight out <br/>\nbut several <br/>\n&gt; comments were made which indicated, and the behavior of the now-<br/>\nformer <br/>\n&gt; girlfriend seemed to confirm), but not at the house.  At a campout <br/>\nin <br/>\n&gt; Arizona.  We had talked about birth control since he turned <br/>\nfourteen, and <br/>\n&gt; everytime he leaves for a teen-filled place and I won&#39;t be there, I <br/>\nremind <br/>\n&gt; him and remind him where his friends can get condoms if they need <br/>\nthem, and <br/>\n&gt; we&#39;ve given them condoms too &quot;in case their friends need them.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My kids don&#39;t much &quot;date.&quot;  They go to movies in groups, they do <br/>\nthings at <br/>\n&gt; people&#39;s houses in groups, they&#39;re not trolling for partners in any <br/>\nway.   <br/>\n&gt; Twice when Kirby had intended and planned to be alone with a girl, <br/>\nothers <br/>\n&gt; showed up and went with them.

I would just make loud general comments <br/>\nlike &quot;If Eric&#39;s bothering you, just tell him to go sleep in the den,&quot; or &quot;If <br/>\nEric&#39;s a problem, we can send him home.&quot;  (He has a car and lives one mile <br/>\naway.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis came up once (on this list or somewhere else, the forum maybe) and <br/>\nsomeone new to unschooling and homeschooling and new to kids being open and <br/>\nhonest got VERY shrill about it.  Someone had asked about a mixed-gender <br/>\nsleepover of eight or nine year olds, I think.  Several of us said we saw no <br/>\nproblem, and this new mom kinda went OFF on us that if we thought that kids <br/>\nhad ever slept in the same room at our house and NOT had sex that we were <br/>\nfooling ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was fascinating to see how strongly SHE obviously thought it was <br/>\ninevitable, or required, that if you can reach each other in the dark you&#39;re <br/>\ngoing to screw like bunnies.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you could all have seen the looks on my kids&#39; faces when I read them her <br/>\npost, you would all KNOW volumes.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby seems probably to have &quot;done it&quot; (I didn&#39;t ask straight out but several <br/>\ncomments were made which indicated, and the behavior of the now-former <br/>\ngirlfriend seemed to confirm), but not at the house.  At a campout in <br/>\nArizona.  We had talked about birth control since he turned fourteen, and <br/>\neverytime he leaves for a teen-filled place and I won&#39;t be there, I remind <br/>\nhim and remind him where his friends can get condoms if they need them, and <br/>\nwe&#39;ve given them condoms too &quot;in case their friends need them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids don&#39;t much &quot;date.&quot;  They go to movies in groups, they do things at <br/>\npeople&#39;s houses in groups, they&#39;re not trolling for partners in any way.   <br/>\nTwice when Kirby had intended and planned to be alone with a girl, others <br/>\nshowed up and went with them.  That&#39;s been an interesting phenomenon.  <br/>\nBecause the greater group of people they hang out with is used to &quot;Sure, come <br/>\non with us,&quot; there was no tactful way for them to say &quot;This time you&#39;re NOT <br/>\nwelcome.&quot;  In both cases, though, he only expressed mild disappointment or <br/>\nsurprise, not any anger.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4335759,"authorName":"HaHaMommy@aol.com","from":"HaHaMommy@...","profile":"thehahamommy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Am I just bein g naïve?","postDate":"1053448713","msgId":70090,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlYy45MzgxMmI4LjJiZmJiNDA5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70086,"nextInTopic":70098,"prevInTime":70089,"nextInTime":70091,"topicId":70078,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5-20-2003 8:16:58 AM Mountain Daylight Time, ...

Because I trust them. <br/>\nBecause they trust me. Their friends aren&#39;t so lucky. Their schoofled and <br/>\nschooledat-home friends are always getting into trouble. I think that the <br/>\nbonds we create while they&#39;re very young can be &quot;lifelines&quot; when they&#39;re <br/>\nolder. <br/>\n<br/>\nToo many parents seem to want to push their babies into growing up. Then when <br/>\nthey&#39;re teens, they want to &quot;baby&quot; them. It just can&#39;t work that way. Parents <br/>\n*must* realize that teens are quickly adults. If they&#39;ve adjusted <br/>\nappropriately to the child&#39;s changes, it should go smoothly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool stops a lot of that &quot;natural progression&quot;---and so do some <br/>\nparents---but I think school plays a huge roll. School says, &quot;Send your <br/>\nbabies to us; don&#39;t worry that they cry!&quot;. Then when they&#39;re teens, school <br/>\nsays, &quot;Lock &#39;em up! Make them DO! Keep them in line! No matter what the <br/>\ncost!&quot;. They can&#39;t have it both ways! <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling allows you to &quot;go with the flow&quot;. Especially as preteens, the <br/>\nchildren are independent one minute and needy, the next. They aren&#39;t allowed <br/>\nthat freedom in school. So as unschoolers, what you get are kids that &quot;know&quot; <br/>\nwhat they &quot;are&quot;. Schooled kids are so mixed up. Unschoolers can be who they <br/>\nare; schooled kids often rely on others&#39; opinions---and NOT those of their <br/>\nparents, who seem totally out of the loop.<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron (15) is VERY open with me about what&#39;s hapening to him and to his <br/>\nfriends. Most of his friends can&#39;t talk to their parents. They&#39;ll talk to me. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI *do* want my boys to go ahead and do what they want. But I can trust that <br/>\nthey are doing things because *they* want to --and that they won&#39;t lie to me <br/>\nabout things or try to keep things from me. The peer pressure is there, but <br/>\nthe hold it has over them is not nearly as strong as that of their friends. <br/>\nIt&#39;s obvious. And they&#39;ll talk with me---about anything. Cameron seems to <br/>\n*want* my opinion. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be that he&#39;s just &quot;that kind of kid&quot;. That&#39;s possible. He&#39;s always <br/>\nbeen an easy child. But I think that a lot of it has to do with the respect <br/>\nand trust we show him ---that his friends don&#39;t get in school or from their <br/>\nschooled parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly, long-winded and maybe not clear enough<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70094,"nextTopicId":70190}}
