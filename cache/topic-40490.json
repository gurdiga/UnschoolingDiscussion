I hope that Sandra Dodd, Ned Vare and Bob (sorry <br/>\ncan&#39;t remember your last name) all continue to post, whatever you <br/>\ndesire on this list. I don&#39;t always agree with any one of you, but I <br/>\nsee the value in all of your collective wisdom.  I think you all <br/>\noffer great point/counterpoint and plenty to discuss and think <br/>\nabout.  And that is the point of this list right?  Pardon me if this <br/>\nis too much of a stretch but your styles remind me of the Malcolm X <br/>\nvs. Martin Luther King discussions back in the day.  Forward movement <br/>\nthrough peaceful march and example or through the sword and the <br/>\nhardline.  I think both are necessary in this unbalanced world, so I <br/>\nappreciate both of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Beth :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing back to lurking now<br/>\nCherry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40756,"nextTopicId":40645}}
