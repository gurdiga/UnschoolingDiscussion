I nearly croaked when my oldest got her first kiss. It took every ounce of restraint for me to not interfere but you can bet, I was *dying* to!  DD could sense my discontent and I could tell that the more I acted that way, the worse it got. So, I had to fake liking the guy and welcome him with open arms. It was extremely hard but I did it &lt;g&gt;. Well, ... the guy practically lived over here... ate his meals here (whad&#39;dIlooklike? A restaurant?!) Anyway, all he wanted to do was snuggle and watch MTV &lt;sigh&gt;. DD *finally* got sick of it and sent him packing after 3 weeks. (yeah!!) When I asked her why they broke up, she said he was totally boring and too possessive. <br/>\nHad I continued on my first course of showing my disapproval, I shudder to think what would have happened. Luckily, I butted out and things went the natural course.<br/>\nIMO you should remain neutral as much as possible. If there&#39;s something you dislike about the girl, if you can possibly point out these qualities without alienating him, that might help him come around to your way of thinking.<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschoolingmommy@...\">Unschoolingmommy@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, December 28, 2001 9:40 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] DATING QUESTION<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I want to ask the list about how they approach the subject of dating and &#39;the <br/>\n  first kiss&#39;.
