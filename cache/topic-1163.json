If only the parents had kept their children away from the<br/>\nguns, we wouldn&#39;t have had such a tragedy. Yeah, it must have been the guns.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt couldn&#39;t have been because of half our children being raised in broken<br/>\nhomes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt couldn&#39;t have been because our children get to spend an average of 30<br/>\nseconds in meaningful conversation with their parents each day. After all,<br/>\nwe<br/>\ngive our children quality time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt couldn&#39;t have been because we treat our children as pets and our pets as<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt couldn&#39;t have been because we place our children in day care centers<br/>\nwhere<br/>\nthey learn their socialization skills among their peers under the law of the<br/>\njungle while employees who have no vested interest in the children look on<br/>\nand<br/>\nmake sure that no blood is spilled.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt couldn&#39;t have been because we allow our children to watch, on average,<br/>\nseven hours of television a day filled with the glorification of sex and<br/>\nviolence that isn&#39;t fit for adult consumption.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt couldn&#39;t have been because we allow (or even encourage) our children to<br/>\nenter into virtual worlds in which, to win the game, one must kill as many<br/>\nopponents as possible in the most sadistic way possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt couldn&#39;t have been because we have sterilized and contracepted our<br/>\nfamilies<br/>\ndown to sizes so small that the children we do have are so spoiled with<br/>\nmaterial things that they come to equate the receiving of the material with<br/>\nlove.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt couldn&#39;t have been because our children, who historically have been seen<br/>\nas<br/>\na blessing from God, are now being viewed as either a mistake created when<br/>\ncontraception fails or inconveniences that parents try to raise in their<br/>\nspare<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt couldn&#39;t have been because we give two-year prison sentences to<br/>\nteen-agers<br/>\nwho kill their newborns.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt couldn&#39;t have been because our school systems teach the children that<br/>\nthey<br/>\nare nothing but glorified apes who have evolutionized out of some primordial<br/>\nsoup of mud . . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nIt couldn&#39;t have been because we teach our children that there are no laws<br/>\nof<br/>\nmorality that transcend us, that everything is relative and that actions<br/>\ndon&#39;t<br/>\nhave consequences.
