Most children just don&#39;t have the capacity<br/>\nmuch before that time. I&#39;ve taken a few graduate<br/>\nschool courses on early reading development, and even<br/>\nthough they were meant for pubic school teachers, they<br/>\ntaught that there was great danger in introducing<br/>\nphonics as early as most pubic schools do.  They say<br/>\nchildren will loose their natural desire to read if<br/>\nphonics is introduced before the child is ready. <br/>\nThink of it this way: when you read do you sound out<br/>\nthe words or are you mostly a sight reader? <br/>\nMichele<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!
