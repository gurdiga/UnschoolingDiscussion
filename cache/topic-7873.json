Although some days<br/>\naround here I think all the boys know are computer and video game strategies<br/>\nand pokemon..... but then I sit and listen to the pokemon talk and I realize<br/>\nthere is a whole host of important things going on, things found ont those<br/>\nboring school worksheets.<br/>\n<br/>\n One of the things that has helped me in this journey is getting up and<br/>\ngetting out of our house.  We went to the dam about two weeks ago.  We<br/>\ntalked about currents, fish, the health of the lake, why we needed a dam,<br/>\nlocks, barges -- it was a great day. Unschooling requires the parent to be a<br/>\ndetective sometimes.  The neat this that once you hone your skills of<br/>\nobservation, you discover the children really are learning more than the PBS<br/>\nschedule.  PLUS you learn how to put neat stuff in their path, so they do<br/>\ncome across the things you think are important.  I&#39;ve purchased books and<br/>\nother materials just to have on hand.....just in case someone had an attack<br/>\nof the academics. &lt;G&gt;  Some of it has actually been used.  Matter of fact, I<br/>\nbought an used Oak Meadow First grade package.  We&#39;ve used some of the ideas<br/>\non creating special books for each child.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy don&#39;t you tell us what things you would like the kids to be doing, and<br/>\nlet us brainstorm ways of doing them.  We&#39;ll see if our creative powers are<br/>\nstill here, or whether they&#39;ve gone to sleep with the spring allergies<br/>\neveryone is having.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisaKK<br/>\nOriginal Message -----<br/>\nFrom: K WORTHEN &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kworthen@...\">kworthen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, April 06, 2000 6:56 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Hello<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi  lisa,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure whah I mean.
