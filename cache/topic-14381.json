I<br/>\nmight be reading too much into it, but I think most people prefer to live in<br/>\nthe culture of their upbringing because that is where they are most<br/>\ncomfortable, not because there is something inherently superior about that<br/>\nparticular place. (After all, familiar injustices are harder to see, and<br/>\neasier to tolerate, than unfamiliar ones). There are probably few or no<br/>\nSlovenes on this list, so naturally hardly anyone will say they&#39;d rather<br/>\nlive in Slovenia. But I think this says more about the make-up of this list<br/>\nthan about the quality of life in Slovenia or the relative value of<br/>\nSlovenian culture. If you were referring to the atrocities in Yugoslavia in<br/>\nrecent times, exceptional circumstances can bring people to decide that<br/>\nemigrating seems like a better option than staying where they are. However,<br/>\nthe amount of gut-wrenching pain involved in uprooting yourself and your<br/>\nchildren in this way cannot be underestimated. I know a number of Serbs,<br/>\nCroats and Bosnian Muslims who have fled abroad. Their hearts ache for their<br/>\nhomelands, and I know where they would rather be living.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a semi-tangent, after regular public school turned out to be disastrous<br/>\nfor my sister, she spent some time unschooling, and then went to live in<br/>\nSkopje, FYRO Macedonia as a Rotary International exchange student during the<br/>\nequivalent of 11th grade. The number one question she got when she told<br/>\npeople (she was in the US at the time) where she was going was &quot;WHY?!&quot; No,<br/>\nactually that was the number two question, after &quot;WHERE?!&quot; She fell in love<br/>\nwith Macedonia in particular and the Balkans in general to the point where<br/>\nshe&#39;s now doing an undergrad degree in Serbo-Croatian (the University of<br/>\nLondon doesn&#39;t have a Macedonian program, but the languages are similar). So<br/>\nnow she again faces the question &quot;WHY?!&quot; along with &quot;What are you going to<br/>\ndo with that?&quot;, which both she and I object to on many levels. I&#39;m not<br/>\nsurprised at all that she has chosen this path.
