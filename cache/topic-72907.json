One of the new members wrote that she was reading every post and wondered if others could possibly be doing the same.  I have to say that for a month now I have read almost every single post, though often skipping a few days if I have to!  I don&#39;t think i could be implementing the changes I am making towards truly respectful, natural, unschooling mentality if I didn&#39;t have this community&#39;s example, debate, support.  The discussions about Wishcraft r.e. thinking about your own wishes as a child reminded me of how much I loved listening to good adult converstaion or being part of it myself.  I remember sitting among the adults in our living room one day when they were debating something in the paper (can&#39;t remember what - could have been about Patty Hearst or Nixon or even just the price of stamps!)  and thinking to myself that good conversation could feel so filling -I was about 10 I think.   I get that feeling here. I have a lot of friends  -in my area and all over the world - but none of them are on this same Unschooling journey (yet) so I can&#39;t really share it with them or get as much from their parenting conversation.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAre there any people from Atlanta (I am an hour east) on this list?  We go to a hschooling playgroup already but i am looking for unschoolers who may want to visit our orgainc farm or meet in Atlanta once in a while.  My boys are almost 6 and just 3. <br/>\n <br/>\n I am really grateful for this list.  <br/>\n <br/>\n-Madeline  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
