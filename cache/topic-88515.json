They&#39;re making <br/>\nconversation, or they&#39;re being belligerent, or they&#39;re trying to prove their superiority <br/>\nin some small social way.  It&#39;s friendlier, in some cases (like you&#39;re both <br/>\nat someone else&#39;s party) to do an aikido thing and lift them up with the force <br/>\nof their own question, set them back down and both laugh about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they&#39;re intrigued enough to ask you again later, you have the advantage.  <br/>\nIf they figure out you really DO have some basis for your belief, they might <br/>\njust leave it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard enough to explain it clearly to people who have kids who aren&#39;t in <br/>\nschool who are looking for something to do today.  It can sometimes be a waste <br/>\nto even begin to explain it to people who have no children, or whose children <br/>\nare on the scholarship track and can&#39;t decide between a Rhodes scholarship or <br/>\nthe air force academy.  That was my friend Kim and me last Friday at lunch at <br/>\nChow&#39;s Chinese Restaurant on Juan Tabo.  Kim knows my kids and thinks they <br/>\nare lovely exceptions to the rule.  So we just have a nice lunch and I coo about <br/>\nher kids&#39; school successes.   Doesn&#39;t bother me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when someone DOES care, you get to the core of their own thinking by <br/>\ntalking about their own experiences.   Ask them what they would change about their <br/>\nschooling, maybe, if they could go back.  Or what their worst experiences <br/>\nwere.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I do when I think someone cares is I ask if they know about the open <br/>\nclassroom theories of the early 1970&#39;s.  If they say yes, I say &quot;it&#39;s like that, <br/>\nbut with the whole world as a classroom.&quot;   If they say no, I say &quot;School <br/>\nreformers knew clearly THEN that kids will only learn what they discover and find <br/>\ninteresting.&quot;   Then I gauge their reaction.  If it&#39;s forward/positive, I go <br/>\non.  If it&#39;s &quot;Der? Huh?&quot; (not verbally, but in posture and eyes), I give <br/>\nexamples, or discuss what they do/know and how they might have learned the best <br/>\nparts of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone was &quot;a good student&quot; and I know it, I ask them how many times they <br/>\nremember being told again what the subject and predicate of the sentence <br/>\nwere, and by then they&#39;re already laughing with recognition of the fact that <br/>\nschool is a whole lot of repetition.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I tell them that when I was teaching I realized that for just about <br/>\nanything I was about to tell the kids, ten already knew and ten didn&#39;t care, <br/>\nso I&#39;d aim my comments at those ten in the middle.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut these answers are about how I respond, and I don&#39;t think canned answers <br/>\nwill really cut it, because people need to have enough inside them to carry on <br/>\na short or long conversation without needing more script.   So for someone who <br/>\nisn&#39;t confident enough to do that, I think passing on websites or names of <br/>\nbooks is a good way to acknowledge the other person&#39;s curiosity (or over-honor <br/>\nit elaborately, if they don&#39;t really care) and to get gracefully out of the <br/>\nconversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother argument I&#39;ve used sometimes is to say that if my kids decide later <br/>\nthey want to go to school, schools will still be there, but if they decide <br/>\nlater they wish their kids had NOT gone to school it will be too late.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] What do you say to people that just dont GET IT?","postDate":"1073929268","msgId":88546,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhNy4xZTg2MTMwZi4yZDM0MzYzNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":88544,"nextInTopic":88548,"prevInTime":88545,"nextInTime":88547,"topicId":88515,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/12/04 2:05:03 AM, WendyWCarr@msn.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-755024104\">In a message dated 1/12/04 2:05:03 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WendyWCarr@...\">WendyWCarr@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  I mean, what if it doesn&#39;t <br/>\npan out and at some point, say when he&#39;s 14 or 15, he wants (or needs to) <br/>\nreturn to school?

And they draw reasonable sounding but erroneous conclusions<br/>\nfrom those misconceptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like Dawn&#39;s answer. Your friend is feeling uncomfortable with your<br/>\ndecisions. But it isn&#39;t your obligation to justify your decisions to her. It<br/>\nisn&#39;t your obligation to educate her. Her hostile questioning -- eg, saying<br/>\nin various ways that you can&#39;t possibly be right -- is saying you do owe her<br/>\nan explanation because you&#39;re obviously not operating on all cylinders to<br/>\ncare so little about your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course saying that sounds hostile ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could say you&#39;d be happy to answer some of her questions if she can turn<br/>\noff the assumptions that unschooling can&#39;t possibly work. By assuming<br/>\nunschooling can&#39;t work she&#39;s saying you&#39;re an idiot for blindly believing in<br/>\nsomething impossible. You could answer her questions more affectively if she<br/>\nassumes there is an answer to her question but she just can&#39;t conceive of<br/>\nthe answer because she doesn&#39;t know enough about how unschooling works.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s some answers to her specific questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I mean, what if it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; pan out and at some point, say when he&#39;s 14 or 15, he wants (or needs to)<br/>\n&gt; return to school?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Natural learning works so kids won&#39;t be behind in understanding the broader<br/>\nconcepts as people assume they will be. There may be details they&#39;ll need to<br/>\nfill in but teachers spend several weeks reviewing at the beginning of the<br/>\nyear. And if someone wants to attend school, they&#39;re going to be willing to<br/>\nput in the effort to do what they need to to understand. The catch up work<br/>\n-- as other unschooling kids who&#39;ve tried school have found -- is, if any is<br/>\neven needed, on the order of weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat idea bothers many people because it says all the work they&#39;re doing to<br/>\nkeep up isn&#39;t necessary. But just because something is disturbing doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmean it isn&#39;t true.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If it were me, I&#39;d want to be sure that he could at least<br/>\n&gt; go back at a grade somewhat in line with his age.  It would be pretty tough<br/>\n&gt; to have to start at 6th grade at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Spending hours cramming in what schooled kids do to prepare for an event<br/>\nthat probably won&#39;t happen -- especially if the preparation only takes a<br/>\nshort amount of time -- is going to be time that&#39;s better spent on things he<br/>\nwants to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; To me, it means that if<br/>\n&gt; Chase demonstrates an interest in say, dinosaurs, I would check out some<br/>\n&gt; books from the library on that ...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling can look like that but the exploration happens at the child&#39;s<br/>\nspeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe essential difference is that with other forms of learning the impulse<br/>\ncomes from outside, pushing what someone else wants inward.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith unschooling, the impulse comes from the child, drawing *in* what they<br/>\nwant. The unschooling parent&#39;s job is to help kids know what&#39;s available<br/>\nthat they could be interested in. It&#39;s not hands off by any means! A child<br/>\ncan&#39;t know they&#39;re interested in dinosaurs or evolution unless they stumble<br/>\nacross them in an interesting context! So the unschooling parents job is to<br/>\nexpose kids to the richness of the world. But not to force them to explore<br/>\nit in any particular way or any particular order.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just worry about a child being limited in academics at<br/>\n&gt; an early age and what impact that has on long term educational prospects -<br/>\n&gt; ie college.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which implies that I&#39;m not. It&#39;s best to assume there&#39;s an answer that you<br/>\ndon&#39;t yet understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m all for encouraging interests,<br/>\n&gt; but I think that there are some areas that may not be &quot;fun&quot; but are<br/>\n&gt; intrinsic to a well-rounded academic education.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which, again, assumes that I don&#39;t care about that. Unschooling works in<br/>\nways that most people don&#39;t understand. But it does work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s pretty tough to write a solid entrance essay if you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; never had critical writing work, KWIM?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which is an assumption most people make. But it is an assumption and a false<br/>\none at that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere *is* an answer. It&#39;s impossible to grasp unschooling if someone<br/>\nassumes that it&#39;s impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting for real personally meaningful reasons is orders of magnitude easier<br/>\nthan writing something someone doesn&#39;t want to write for an audience who<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want the information. (The teacher &quot;wants&quot; the paper but is only<br/>\ninterested in the how well skills are employed, not in the information.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a more general answer about unschooling:<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of what we believe we know about how learning must happen comes from<br/>\nthe decisions schools make about education.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut schools don&#39;t make the decisions they do based on what&#39;s best for<br/>\nchildren. They make the decisions they do based on what&#39;s best for schools.<br/>\nAnd that makes sense. What&#39;s best for the schools is what&#39;s (seemingly) best<br/>\nfor the children since if the schools can&#39;t operate, the children can&#39;t<br/>\n(supposedly) learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut schools are also assembly lines. Assembly lines are cheap and efficient.<br/>\nMost teachers would agree that one-on-one learning or at least very small<br/>\ngroups is best for learning and yet children are taught 30 at a time because<br/>\nit would cost too much to have one teacher for each child or even each half<br/>\ndozen children.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving large class sizes is a huge compromise in what children need to learn<br/>\nbut it&#39;s done for practical reasons. What&#39;s gained by having schools that<br/>\ncan operate (by not costing too much) seems better than not having schools<br/>\nat all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo kids are taught assembly line fashion because it&#39;s cost efficient. And<br/>\nbecause assembly lines are necessary for schools, schools make the decisions<br/>\nthey do that keep the assembly line functioning smoothly.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Children* don&#39;t need to read independently by 9. *Schools* need children to<br/>\nread independently by 9. (And what&#39;s best for schools is (supposedly) best<br/>\nfor children.) Schools as they are can&#39;t effectively help children who can&#39;t<br/>\nread independently by 9 so all children *must* read by 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat goes for everything that schools teach. Children don&#39;t need biology at<br/>\n15. Kids will acquire and draw on biological knowledge when they need it.<br/>\nBut to run efficiently schools need to have all children learning biology at<br/>\n15.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how can they learn biology and algebra and everything else unless it&#39;s<br/>\ntaught to them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same way they learned English: as a tool to get what they want. By using<br/>\nEnglish to get what they want they get better at it as a side effect. And<br/>\nthe beauty is that it&#39;s self correcting because the goal is to get something<br/>\nthat works rather than to acquire something that&#39;s right.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we think of how they learned English versus how kids (supposedly) learn a<br/>\nforeign language in school, which worked better? English is learned<br/>\npractically effortlessly. But we don&#39;t take that learning seriously as real<br/>\nlearning. It seems some magical process that applies only to very young<br/>\nchildren learning their native language.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we assume the only legitimate knowledge is what&#39;s in textbooks, and the<br/>\nonly legitimate form it can take is what&#39;s in textbooks, then it&#39;s going to<br/>\nbe hard to understand unschooling. Few people will be encountering and<br/>\nsolving 2x = 3y = 27 in their daily lives. Few people will absorb the<br/>\nimportant factors of the Teapot Dome scandal by living life. (Those who do<br/>\nneed it because of their interests, though, *will* be getting that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut textbooks are like the details. And real learning is about building up<br/>\nan understanding of how the big picture works. Schools hope that kids will<br/>\nunderstand the big picture by cramming in the details but if it happens it&#39;s<br/>\na side effect. But unfortunately schools are handicapped by having to prove<br/>\nto administrators and parents and the state that learning is happening. So,<br/>\ndespite wanting something better for kids, schools need to concentrate on<br/>\nthe type of learning that can be demonstrated, that is the kind that is<br/>\ntestable. It&#39;s hard to test understanding so schools settle for testing what<br/>\ncan be memorized and hope that understanding happens as a side effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo kids in school learn the details and might gain an understanding of the<br/>\nbig picture at the same time. But it&#39;s hard and often not successful. It&#39;s<br/>\nhard to grasp the concept of what percentage means in a larger context, when<br/>\nimmersed in figuring out 37.2% of 128. But by absorbing the big picture,<br/>\nbuilding it up slowly of when and why percentages are used in real life<br/>\ncontexts, then the details fit easily into the big picture.
