He traveled along the Mason-Dixon Line, talking to people along the way. Here is a quote from Booklist: &quot;Ecenbarger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, walked the accessible parts of the 365-mile line and sought out people with stories to tell that would shed light on the line&#39;s historical and racial significance. Ecenbarger also cites Charles Mason&#39;s journal, courthouse records, and interviews with residents of Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania who live along the line. The Mason-Dixon Line represents racial tensions and mirrors animosities that have persisted through slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, the civil rights era, and even today, with some towns practicing unofficial racial division. Highlighting this checkered history, Ecenbarger visited Harriet Tubman&#39;s Underground Railroad and the site of reverse operation, where free blacks were sold into slavery in the South.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\ndebbie <br/>\n<br/>\ncrazeemom77043 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LauraBourdo@...\">LauraBourdo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nYou guys are da bomb!
