Rather than create more junk mail by mailing things<br/>\nback, though, call the 800 number inside the catalog or on the junk mailing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk to be taken off their mailing list.  Ask the people you do want to<br/>\nreceive catalogues from to put you on their &quot;do not sell list&quot; or whatever<br/>\nsuch thing they have.  Check the &quot;privacy&quot; box on every web site you visit.<br/>\nCall that number that&#39;s regularly circulated to opt-out on credit card<br/>\noffers.  And finally, check with your phone service provider -- in Montana,<br/>\nthey told us that if we listed our phone number without address, we wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe on the junk-mail lists.  We received very little junk mail during our<br/>\nyears there.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it takes time, especially initially.  But it cuts your junk mail down<br/>\nextraordinarily, and I think that&#39;s worth something as far as the<br/>\nenvironment is concerned.   Moving overseas helps a lot, too, but that&#39;s not<br/>\nfor everyone!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68843,"nextTopicId":68813}}
