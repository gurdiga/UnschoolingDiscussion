It&#39;s common, when children hold opinions we consider very dumb or bad, to attribute this to their age rather than their mind. It&#39;s common to think it&#39;s not a real opinion seriously held, and to assume it will be changed to match our own opinion if only it&#39;s given more thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that is a temptation we must resist.

This is, again, a way of delegitimizing the disagreement. It&#39;s not a clash of ideas to be treated rationally and with an open mind; it&#39;s just a child being childish and thus his thoughts needn&#39;t actually be addressed. Behind this kind of guessing is the same ageism as in the first phenomenon.

It is true that unschoolers serendipitously and creatively learn a lot about things that are momentarily or permanently interesting to them. But when unschoolers have specific goals in life, such as careers that can only or most easily be obtained via a degree in mathematics, they find out what they need, explore various ways of getting it, and jump through whatever hoops are necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a case in point, my 15yo daughter is interested in a career in set design. She did her research and discovered that a theater degree can be very helpful in obtaining the types of jobs she would like to one day have. As a result, my &quot;I&#39;m not going to college&quot; free spirit is now looking at college entrance requirements, considering ways of improving SAT scores, and designing her own curriculum of sorts. There *are* hoops to jump through, and she&#39;s quite willing to do so in order to pursue this thing that she wants. <br/>\n<br/>\nWill any of this cause her pain? Maybe.

It seems to me this view does not sufficiently respect human beings. School hurts people and being hurt is bad. It&#39;s not a matter of hoops. It&#39;s not a negotiable part of life. Being hurt is not something to be weighed against other factors. It&#39;s certainly not a &quot;small part of the price of admission&quot; (if anything, it&#39;s 99% of the cost, certainly far more important than the price of tuition). And it&#39;s not a &quot;new fun park&quot; if one is being hurt. Being hurt is not fun, and it spoils any fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not think people should go through life accepting suffering. If a life path involves suffering, it&#39;s not good enough. To me that indicates a problem to be solved. And problems can be solved. There is never any time to give up on having a fully pleasant life and accept bad things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think people are powerful, and they don&#39;t need school. They can learn things, and accomplish their goals, without it. There is no external force stopping people from living life on their own terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not think an aversion to suffering should be deemed emotional in the sense of a bias or prejudice to be discounted. It&#39;s rational.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople are sacrosanct and should not by acceptant of their lives containing unpleasantness or or dirty bathwater. People should not put up with things.

It seems like it is less easy for many people to apply the same principle<br/>\nwhen it comes to math. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not mean to suggest that anyone was currently being ridiculous.

I wasn&#39;t telling anyone that they should learn math ***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that. The post I responded to, however, spoke specifically about the value of learning math. The crux of the discussion has been the way math is overvalued because it is seen as a core subject that everyone must know, sometimes even by those of us who would never think of forcing someone to learn it. Sometimes unschoolers might be tempted to jump on an interest in math because we are conditioned to think it could lead to a lucrative career or produce impressive credentials. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***and I have nothing against opera.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have nothing against math, nor against people who do have something against opera.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know of people who believe that opera singing is the only kind of singing or music anyone should be interested in. It is what they like and what they do so they believe all singers should do the same.

If  <br/>\nit&#39;s simple geometry that can be visualized or done with a ruler, that  <br/>\n(to me) is like harmonizing, or transposing from one key to another.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s not a big deal.  I don&#39;t need the numbers, I need the proportions  <br/>\nand the relationships, some chalk and a yardstick.  I can figure 45  <br/>\ndegree corner-sections plus seam allowance without a formula.  I can  <br/>\nfigure out how much cloth will be needed for a Viking a-frame, and how  <br/>\nto fasten in ties for the door and loops for stakes that will NOT come  <br/>\nundone.

There was no other purpose to be  <br/>\nthere other than to suck what one could from it. There were no  <br/>\ncarrots at the other end. The journey was it. And people used the  <br/>\nresources and time of that week to travel where they wanted to go.  <br/>\nObviously there were no grades and people put in a huge amount of  <br/>\nhours outside of the workshop trying to get what they wanted from it<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople go to Hampshire College (which uses detailed evaluations  <br/>\nrather than grades) because they want that four years of experience  <br/>\nat Hampshire, not because it&#39;s a stepping stone to some vague  <br/>\nAmerican Dream.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt most colleges, most students are there to get a piece of paper at  <br/>\nthe end.

That&#39;s why I <br/>\nthought this list might be a good place to discuss it. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a little confused about what you want to discuss Keith.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to convince us that school testing is generally bad for kids. <br/>\nHowever you do talk about parents teaching within their own expertise which <br/>\nbetrays some misunderstanding of how unschooling works.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a good place to discuss the practices, thought process and <br/>\nprinciples that help parents to unschool their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you wanting to learn some higher math yourself without going to <br/>\nuniversity to do it and want some ideas or resource recommendations to <br/>\naccomplish that?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you asking on behalf of your kids? If so how old are they and how long <br/>\nhave you been unschooling? Are you making predictions about the future?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might think these are odd questions, but sometimes people new to <br/>\nunschooling come here all worried about stuff and asking &quot;How do they learn <br/>\ncalculus?&quot; type questions, with a lot of fear behind them, and their kids <br/>\nturn out to be 3 years old. The best answer in that type of case is &quot;live in <br/>\nthe moment with your child, play with them, and work on your own <br/>\ndeschooling&quot; - which means purging the school think and shadow schooly <br/>\nassumptions from your mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a lot easier to offer advice about real and immediate problems, rather <br/>\nthan hypotheticals, because the answers differ depending on why you want to <br/>\nknow. *Why* is a huge question in unschooling. Why is a question we ask <br/>\nourselves a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith, it seems like you are already aware of many of the negatives of <br/>\nschool. For me, I avoid and limit my involvement in other people&#39;s school <br/>\nconversations. I found that school conversations sucked me into a negative <br/>\nmental space - we all know that schools have a lot of problems and <br/>\nfacilitate some pretty awful situations for kids. The only advice I have for <br/>\nany of my friends who are distressed by their kids&#39; school experiences and <br/>\ndetermined to rehash the problems endlessly, is to say that they do have <br/>\nother choices, of which I am living proof. Unfortunately that answer is not <br/>\nwhat most others want to hear. They are more interested in either <br/>\ncommisseration, or strategies to tweak the system as much as is possible, or <br/>\nstrategies to manipulate their kids into compliance and the appearance of <br/>\ngreater happiness. I have little to add to any of those agendas.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first went to college directly from school, I was in the wrong place. <br/>\nAlthough there were parts of my classes that I truly enjoyed, much of it was <br/>\njust flat too difficult (including Higher Math) and not relevant to how I <br/>\nwished to earn my living. When I returned to college some years later to <br/>\nfollow my passion for Theater, it was a much better experience. The <br/>\nassessment system had few examinations involved, and those were all in the <br/>\nFreshman year. Later years included mostly project based grading with <br/>\nsimilar criteria as one would find in the professional world of Theater, and <br/>\nsome essays for the theory portions. It is possible to find University <br/>\nstudies that do not include exams.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever I think the experience of most unschoolers as they grow up and <br/>\nparticipate in various kinds of classes and formal learning opportunities, <br/>\nis that they are able to assess fairly quickly whether the hoops are worth <br/>\nit to them. They tend to be willing to put up with the rules, assignments, <br/>\ntests and grades as just a small part of the price of admission of exploring <br/>\nthis new fun park.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn overweaning desire or intention to avoid grading or tests at all costs, <br/>\nespecially at college level, doesn&#39;t sound like the usual thinking or <br/>\npractice of the grown unschoolers who are attending tertiary education with <br/>\ngreat success and enjoyment. It seems a bit like throwing out the baby with <br/>\nthe bathwater.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps unschoolers are acceptant of tests and grading at college level <br/>\n*because* they have lived a childhood free of this kind of external <br/>\njudgment. They haven&#39;t been defined and confined by grades all their lives, <br/>\nso as young adults they don&#39;t have any emotional aversion to them .<br/>\n<br/>\nIf being graded or taking tests as an adult is so repugnant to you, Keith, <br/>\nperhaps that is an area of school damage in your psyche worth winkling out <br/>\nand exploring for the sake of healing. Personally I would love to develop a <br/>\ngreater sense of self worth released from my concern about how others are <br/>\nseeing and judging me. I believe I tend to worry about other&#39;s opinions <br/>\nbecause I had good grades and was a good test taker in school. Letting go of <br/>\ngrades as a measure of my value has been a journey.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I wasn&#39;t telling anyone that they should learn math and I have nothing against opera.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra and Joyce,<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that choice and freedom are very important. Making school compulsory isn&#39;t just cruel to the people it makes unhappy, it also makes the school worse at teaching for a variety of reasons. It means there are unhappy or uninterested people around who are distracting. It means the teachers do not find ways to attract students with interesting and fun lessons. And it results in a self-selected group of teachers: the teachers are going to be people who, for whatever reason, don&#39;t mind that school is compulsory. These are significant disadvantages compared to a university.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI also take your point that learning things the parents have enough knowledge to teach, and learning things beyond the parents&#39; expertise, are different situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that kids, or anyone, can pick up math, or any other knowledge, without a formal curriculum. Learning can be done in a natural or apparently automatic way, and such learning is not inferior. Learning can also be done in a more guided way (the lead guide, with the final say in all decisions, should always be the learner himself).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that no one mentioned is some of the reasons schools are bad places which universities share. For example, schools have grades and tests, and so do universities. Grades and tests are well known to be unpleasant and stressful, and well known to be unwanted by most students. They are, for most people most of the time, bad thing. And they aren&#39;t too surprising to find at a compulsory place that doesn&#39;t care what the students want. But why are they are universities too? And they aren&#39;t optional at universities, they are forced on everyone. Why doesn&#39;t the university take care to provide only what its students want, and only things that don&#39;t hurt anyone? Why didn&#39;t they at least make the grades and test optional, or find some alternative choices to offer people who don&#39;t like them? There is something wrong with universities too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one makes the choice not to attend a university, for various reasons such as not wanting to be graded and other issues, they may still want to learn some of the things which universities teach. There are a wide variety of options open to them. They are not in a bad situation. There are many ways to learn it which would work out great! But there are also ways to try to learn it that would not work out. Some options are good, some not so good, and one has to figure it out. That takes some thought, and perhaps some advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s difficult to ask most people for advice about a situation like that because their view of education revolves around formal schooling.

That&#39;s why I thought this list might be a good place to discuss it. There may be people here who are familiar with options besides school, and can pass on some of their hard-won wisdom. Or there may be people currently interested in similar issues. Or there may, at least, be people sympathetic to the idea of not attending school, and open minded to discussion of what that may entail.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":158915970,"authorName":"Alan Marshall","from":"Alan Marshall &lt;alanlmarshall@...&gt;","profile":"alanlmarshall","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] How To Learn Math","postDate":"1261887700","msgId":113258,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENPTDEyMS1XMjQxNDk2NUU1NzRDMkY1NjU1REVDQTU3QzBAcGh4LmdibD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEI4OEUxQzI3LTRCMEUtNDdGNC04MDJDLThCRTdFQUFDNjU2QUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PEQxODY3QTgzLTJCRTEtNEY2My04RDdFLTU5RUExNTA4NzIxRkBnbWFpbC5jb20+IDw2NjlDODA2NC00OTc4LTQ4N0MtOTI0OC1GNkY5NTA2QjU2MzFAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+LDxCODhFMUMyNy00QjBFLTQ3RjQtODAyQy04QkU3RUFBQzY1NkFAZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":113257,"nextInTopic":113259,"prevInTime":113257,"nextInTime":113259,"topicId":113250,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Math is fun and useful.

It&#39;s much harder for someone to learn English when no one  <br/>\naround them is speaking it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath is the same. Addition, multiplication, percentages, and so on  <br/>\nget used in everyday life so they get absorbed the same as a native  <br/>\nlanguage.<br/>\n<br/>\nHigher math is harder to pick up unless you&#39;re doing something that  <br/>\nuses it. If you&#39;re are, then an understanding gets absorbed because  <br/>\nit&#39;s describing something physical you&#39;re working with.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you want to use math for?

Unschoolers come across as anti-anything that&#39;s found in  <br/>\nschool, but that impression comes from helping people turn away from  <br/>\nschool and face the real world. Until someone lets go of their  <br/>\ndependence on textbooks, textbooks are a crutch.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce someone trusts that learning is what we do naturally by living  <br/>\nlife, then textbooks are just another resource that some people might  <br/>\nfind useful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There are math lectures online, but they generally are created at  <br/>\n&gt; schools, and have a school style to them.

The problem is that  <br/>\nquiet often, especially with math, the knowledge is divorced from  <br/>\nuse. Math is taken out of context. The purpose of math is to describe  <br/>\nthe world. One of math&#39;s purposes is to allow people to manipulate a  <br/>\nmodel of the world so they don&#39;t have to, for instance, go shifting a  <br/>\nplanet around the solar system to see what effect that has on the  <br/>\nrest of them ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout the world, math is esoteric and much harder to learn. Unless  <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s love is math! :-) Some people love grammar. Some people  <br/>\nlove timelines. Playing with those in isolation may give someone a  <br/>\nstructure to hang information on but imploding buildings, English  <br/>\nlanguage and political leaders sending out their troops to suppress  <br/>\nand insurgency are all dynamic entities. Beginning with the rigid  <br/>\nstructure will hamper someone&#39;s understanding of the real world.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn college I learned how to manipulate nice tidy equations to get an  <br/>\nanswer. I had no deep understanding of what the equations could  <br/>\ndescribe, or why I might want the answer, but I could make the  <br/>\nequations perform for me. The problem is that the real world isn&#39;t  <br/>\nneat and tidy. Real world equations can be messy. Unless you have a  <br/>\ngood understanding of the real world object the equation is  <br/>\ndescribing, the equation is just confusing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what do you want to use the math for? If you&#39;re fascinated by  <br/>\nmath, then any resource: books, DVDs, manipulatives, museum displays,  <br/>\nmath geeks that helps you understand is good. In fact using a variety  <br/>\nof resources is better since understanding rarely happens from a  <br/>\nsingle explanation. (That&#39;s why it&#39;s so notable when those flashes of  <br/>\ninsight happen!) Real learning comes from encountering the same idea  <br/>\nseveral times in different contexts. Our understanding builds slowly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, on the other hand, your goal is astronomy or rocket science,  <br/>\nbetter to delve into those and learn just enough math as you need it  <br/>\nto get by.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn either case, go to Amazon and your library and Barnes and Noble  <br/>\nand start browsing for things that capture your interest. Two pieces  <br/>\nof damage that schools do is in making people believe 1) that it must  <br/>\nbe dry and difficult or it&#39;s not good and 2) that if someone doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstand then it&#39;s their fault.
