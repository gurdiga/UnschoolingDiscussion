It&#39;s impossible for a child to eat what&#39;s not there, so<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not the same kind of &quot;no.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it&#39;s different, and my kids do to.  Even when Stella (4) groans about<br/>\nit, I can tell she is just expressing her dissapointment about not having<br/>\nany, and isn&#39;t really mad at me for saying no.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still feel badly about having to say no in this situation, though, and if<br/>\nI&#39;m not careful, that bad feeling turns outward towards the kids.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nrecently become more aware of how my feelings of guilt and inadequacy can<br/>\nhurt them.  When I have to say no to ice cream because our car is still<br/>\nbroken and the ice cream will melt on the bus ride home, or  because I just<br/>\ncan&#39;t afford something as basic as more butter to make cookies until next<br/>\nweek, it is so frustrating!   I feel so lame and I defensively lash out at<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say that now that I am taking the time to more closely examine my own<br/>\nangry feelings, instead of letting them consume me so much,  I can see a<br/>\npossible end to this vicious cycle.    Yesterday was hell for me as far as<br/>\nfeeling like such a total needy, lame, unable-to-provide parent.  I know it<br/>\nmade made my husband feel pretty shitty too--probably worse than me, because<br/>\nhe is the income-provider and definitely takes his percieved, and actual<br/>\nrole as our protector pretty seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my 3 yo baby girl, Annie, falls down on a rusty nail and punctures<br/>\nher knee fairly deeply.  I call Ron in Portland to tell him, and we both<br/>\nagree that she needs a tetanus shot (we opted out of vaccinations early on<br/>\nwith plans to do tetanus later when they were old enough to do play in dirt<br/>\nand stuff and possibly get hurt in just the way Annie did--only we just<br/>\nhadn&#39;t gotten around to it yet--bad, bad, bad).  Well, my car is broken, so<br/>\nit&#39;s the bus.  The next one would go by my house at 5:30, only a 1/2 hour<br/>\naway.  Problem is there is only 10 minutes from when I get to the hospital<br/>\n15-20 miles down the peninsula to when the next and final bus going towards<br/>\nmy home goes by the hospital.  I have no cash...just checks, and my new<br/>\ndebit card is being sent in the mail, so a taxi, would not only be<br/>\nexpensive, but I don&#39;t really have a way to pay for one.  Oh well,  the ER<br/>\ndoctor says it would be much better if we come in right away rather than<br/>\nwait for morning.  Says they&#39;ll be quick so we can catch that return bus.<br/>\nHe&#39;s really nice, but I still get a 10 minute lecture about how important it<br/>\nis to vaccinate.  Turns out they&#39;re out of the vaccine and have to get send<br/>\nsomeone to Astoria (another 1/2 hour or so away) to get some more.  So it<br/>\nlooks like a cab now.   Maybe they&#39;ll take a check.  The kids are now<br/>\nhungry, as it&#39;s past dinner time, and we are going to be waiting awhile, so<br/>\nI start to ask if there is a store or restaurant nearby, when I remember<br/>\nthat I wrote out my last check at the grocery store the day before and<br/>\nforgot to put a new book of checks in my wallet!  OMG...I can&#39;t feed them<br/>\nAND I can&#39;t pay even a portion of the cost to go to the ER and get a vaccine<br/>\nAND I can&#39;t get a cab home!    Luckily the staff at this hospital are the<br/>\nnicest bunch of people you ever want to meet. They tell me no problem, we<br/>\ncan work out arrangements after you get the bill, and we have someone here<br/>\nwho can bring you all home.  So poor Annie gets her first shot ever,<br/>\nshocking me with her bravery, and we finally head for home.  On the way<br/>\nhome, I ask our driver, a nurse, if I can break an adult tylenol in half for<br/>\nAnnie, because I can&#39;t get to a store for any children&#39;s tylenol, and Annie<br/>\nis really starting to feel bad with the very sore knee and now a shot in the<br/>\narm.  Nurse says I shouldn&#39;t and stops at her sister&#39;s house to get some<br/>\ntylenol for me.  It&#39;s 9:30 at night and I&#39;m so embarrased, but relieved.<br/>\nOnce we get home, I make some macaroni and cheese at Annie&#39;s request and we<br/>\nall sit on the floor and watch The Comfy Couch--another Annie request.  And<br/>\nSarah (10) and Stella are being so sweet to Annie, and so helpful with Evan<br/>\n(just turned 1), while I take care of Annie&#39;s knee and get her ready for<br/>\nbed.  How&#39;d I get so lucky.  They&#39;re all so precious.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told this story not because it was cathartic (although it was!), but<br/>\nbecause I felt so many feelings of inadequacy yesterday during all of this.<br/>\nStill, I didn&#39;t lose it.  Not once.  I breathed.  I was thankful for the<br/>\nkindess of strangers.  I played games with the kids.  I was mindful and<br/>\nloving toward my children and we all benefitted.  Now I&#39;ve done this before<br/>\nwhen something big required me to have it together (I tend to sweat small<br/>\nstuff more than big stuff), but this time I was fully aware that I was<br/>\nmaking a difference in how we would all feel at the end of the day.  I<br/>\nwanted my children to feel as secure as I could make them feel under the<br/>\ncircumstances.  I acted like an adult, despite the childish feelings of<br/>\ninadequacy and guilt that normally make me behave like a 2 year old.   And<br/>\nat the end of the day, my children and I felt so happy and safe and loved.<br/>\nIt was delicious.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is more clear to me than ever that if I just apply that kind of<br/>\nmindfulness and love to the small stuff  that makes up more of our daily<br/>\nlife, then we will be doing beautifully!  Who cares about a messy house or<br/>\nno butter for cookies, when you have such precious gifts who love you<br/>\ndespite your shortcomings and just want you to be with them while they<br/>\ndiscover the world?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Andrea </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95011,"nextTopicId":95325}}
