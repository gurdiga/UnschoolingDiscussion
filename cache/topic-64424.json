C. Bentley <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, April 12, 2003 1:30 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] &quot;chores&quot; and pay<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Zoe is my oldest and she is 6.5 years old.  When she turned 6, we<br/>\n  realized that we hadn&#39;t explicitly ever given her an allowance or any<br/>\n  type of cash money to use as she wanted.  We figured out what we could<br/>\n  always afford to give her and started at that.  Currently it is $3 per<br/>\n  time DH gets paid, or $6 a month.  No, this isn&#39;t a lot, but it is when<br/>\n  you consider that we have budgeted money to be able to buy her anything<br/>\n  that she wants food, book, clothing, arts & crafts, and experiment<br/>\n  wise.  She just needs to tell me what she wants and I&#39;ll happily buy it<br/>\n  (she&#39;s not asking for expensive things, just things like yeast and pipe<br/>\n  cleaners and tapioca).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, she has come up with some creative purchases.  She is a Girl<br/>\n  Scout and she spent quite a bit of her money purchasing cookies (some<br/>\n  for a charity, too).  She has also bought her 2.5 year old sister a<br/>\n  stuffed animal on a whim.  This money is not associated with chores.  We<br/>\n  have no &quot;child has to do chores&quot;.  She does, however, often help me do<br/>\n  the dishes/laundry/vacuuming (she&#39;s excited that she&#39;s finally big<br/>\n  enough to physically run the vacuum).  We rarely require cleaning done<br/>\n  by the kids and even then it is usually just, &quot;Please don&#39;t bring<br/>\n  anything new out until I&#39;ve finished cleaning the floor or table in<br/>\n  order to give you a fresh clean place to have things.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I am a part-time professional photographer from my home and Zoe really<br/>\n  loves to help.  She is quite knowledgeable about cameras and lighting<br/>\n  setup, etc.  So, whenever she helps me with a photo shoot, I pay her. <br/>\n  Depending on how much she works and how much I make for the job, I give<br/>\n  her between $5-$20 per job.  This is never required of her, but rather<br/>\n  an opportunity that is available if she wants to do it.  I also do<br/>\n  contract web design projects that I get paid for.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Here&#39;s a funny/cute story that happened last night:<br/>\n  Note that I&#39;ve *never* required her to clean her room, and once a month<br/>\n  or so DH and I will go in and clean it all (with her permission and<br/>\n  strong desire to find things!!).  Anyway, last night she was asking me<br/>\n  the difference between contract work and having a regular job (like<br/>\n  DH).  She liked the idea of paying someone one time to do a specific<br/>\n  job.  She thought for a bit, then asked if she could pay me to clean her<br/>\n  room!  I asked her when she needed it done by, how much she was willing<br/>\n  to pay, the details of what she wanted cleaned, etc.  She wants it done<br/>\n  by Sunday, is willing to pay half of all the money she has (I don&#39;t know<br/>\n  what that amount is), and she just wants the stuff that belongs in other<br/>\n  rooms put away and the bed made (all stuff that I actually already<br/>\n  regularly do).  I&#39;m excited that she finally noticed that these things<br/>\n  need to be done.  :)  I told her that I&#39;d do all that and more,<br/>\n  willingly and for free, if she&#39;d just keep me company.  She is insisting<br/>\n  on paying me though, so I guess that I&#39;ve got a new job.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  -Lisa in AZ<br/>\n<br/>\n  P.S.  My 2.5 year old cleans for no pay, too.  I have a good routine for<br/>\n  washing clothes.  I always wash a load a day (put in a combo<br/>\n  washer/dryer at night and take out in the morning).  We presort our<br/>\n  dirties into baskets on the closet floor and whichever is the most full<br/>\n  gets washed that night (we also wash diapers).  I will do the laundry in<br/>\n  the morning and my 2.5 year insists on helping me carry the basket of<br/>\n  clean clothes.  She often disappears when I get the clothes to the<br/>\n  bedroom and I discover that she takes the dirty clothes to the wash all<br/>\n  on her own.  She starting doing this- for fun- when she was just a year<br/>\n  and a half old!  We live in a ranch style house with no basement, so it<br/>\n  is safe.  She also loves to unload the dishwasher.  She is a born<br/>\n  organizer.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo! Groups Sponsor <br/>\n              ADVERTISEMENT<br/>\n             <br/>\n       <br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

That candy *does* look<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt; &gt; delicious,<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t it?

There are<br/>\n  &gt;   other things we all pitch in to do that are not paid for because we are <br/>\n  &gt; doing<br/>\n  &gt;   it &#39;for the family&quot; (we are adding onto the house right now) and we never<br/>\n  &gt;   force anyone to work.  We also have special things needed done that we <br/>\n  &gt; will<br/>\n  &gt;   pay extra for (bringing wood in which EVERYONE hates, for example.)

But we<br/>\n  &gt;   do monitor who is doing it and who is not and they are rewarded for <br/>\n  &gt; it.  They<br/>\n  &gt;   know that by doing these things, I am paying them because they are <br/>\n  &gt; taking a<br/>\n  &gt;   big load off of my back (we have 6 kids at home total, I do about 3 or <br/>\n  &gt; more<br/>\n  &gt;   loads of laundry per day alone) and because I really appreciate their <br/>\n  &gt; help.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;   Anyhow, if they always have money, it does eliminate them even asking for<br/>\n  &gt;   stuff, although I am often buying candy or goodies anyway.

When she turned 6, we<br/>\nrealized that we hadn&#39;t explicitly ever given her an allowance or any<br/>\ntype of cash money to use as she wanted.  We figured out what we could<br/>\nalways afford to give her and started at that.  Currently it is $3 per<br/>\ntime DH gets paid, or $6 a month.  No, this isn&#39;t a lot, but it is when<br/>\nyou consider that we have budgeted money to be able to buy her anything<br/>\nthat she wants food, book, clothing, arts & crafts, and experiment<br/>\nwise.  She just needs to tell me what she wants and I&#39;ll happily buy it<br/>\n(she&#39;s not asking for expensive things, just things like yeast and pipe<br/>\ncleaners and tapioca).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, she has come up with some creative purchases.  She is a Girl<br/>\nScout and she spent quite a bit of her money purchasing cookies (some<br/>\nfor a charity, too).  She has also bought her 2.5 year old sister a<br/>\nstuffed animal on a whim.  This money is not associated with chores.  We<br/>\nhave no &quot;child has to do chores&quot;.  She does, however, often help me do<br/>\nthe dishes/laundry/vacuuming (she&#39;s excited that she&#39;s finally big<br/>\nenough to physically run the vacuum).  We rarely require cleaning done<br/>\nby the kids and even then it is usually just, &quot;Please don&#39;t bring<br/>\nanything new out until I&#39;ve finished cleaning the floor or table in<br/>\norder to give you a fresh clean place to have things.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am a part-time professional photographer from my home and Zoe really<br/>\nloves to help.  She is quite knowledgeable about cameras and lighting<br/>\nsetup, etc.  So, whenever she helps me with a photo shoot, I pay her. <br/>\nDepending on how much she works and how much I make for the job, I give<br/>\nher between $5-$20 per job.  This is never required of her, but rather<br/>\nan opportunity that is available if she wants to do it.  I also do<br/>\ncontract web design projects that I get paid for.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a funny/cute story that happened last night:<br/>\nNote that I&#39;ve *never* required her to clean her room, and once a month<br/>\nor so DH and I will go in and clean it all (with her permission and<br/>\nstrong desire to find things!!).  Anyway, last night she was asking me<br/>\nthe difference between contract work and having a regular job (like<br/>\nDH).  She liked the idea of paying someone one time to do a specific<br/>\njob.  She thought for a bit, then asked if she could pay me to clean her<br/>\nroom!  I asked her when she needed it done by, how much she was willing<br/>\nto pay, the details of what she wanted cleaned, etc.  She wants it done<br/>\nby Sunday, is willing to pay half of all the money she has (I don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat that amount is), and she just wants the stuff that belongs in other<br/>\nrooms put away and the bed made (all stuff that I actually already<br/>\nregularly do).  I&#39;m excited that she finally noticed that these things<br/>\nneed to be done.  :)  I told her that I&#39;d do all that and more,<br/>\nwillingly and for free, if she&#39;d just keep me company.  She is insisting<br/>\non paying me though, so I guess that I&#39;ve got a new job.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lisa in AZ<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  My 2.5 year old cleans for no pay, too.  I have a good routine for<br/>\nwashing clothes.  I always wash a load a day (put in a combo<br/>\nwasher/dryer at night and take out in the morning).  We presort our<br/>\ndirties into baskets on the closet floor and whichever is the most full<br/>\ngets washed that night (we also wash diapers).  I will do the laundry in<br/>\nthe morning and my 2.5 year insists on helping me carry the basket of<br/>\nclean clothes.  She often disappears when I get the clothes to the<br/>\nbedroom and I discover that she takes the dirty clothes to the wash all<br/>\non her own.  She starting doing this- for fun- when she was just a year<br/>\nand a half old!  We live in a ranch style house with no basement, so it<br/>\nis safe.  She also loves to unload the dishwasher.  She is a born<br/>\norganizer.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96545052,"authorName":"marji","from":"marji &lt;marji@...&gt;","profile":"gaia10921","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] &quot;chores&quot; and pay","postDate":"1050167475","msgId":64484,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMi4wLjkuMC4yMDAzMDQxMjEwMDg1OC4wMWY2ZGQ5MEBtYWlsLmdhaWF3b2xmLm9yZz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE5NjkwMWMzMDExNCRlYzQwODE5MCQ2ODAxYThjMEBBb3Blbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzNC4xZTIxZTRhNi4yYmM5NmIwNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64480,"nextInTopic":64488,"prevInTime":64483,"nextInTime":64485,"topicId":64424,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey Janis, I was wondering if you come to any pow wows/festivals in the downstate/Hudson Valley area of New York state.

That candy *does* look <br/>\n&gt; &gt; delicious,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t it?  It makes me want to hurry up and check out so we can go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; home and bake cookies.&quot;  Also it helps that I have never, ever bought<br/>\n&gt; &gt; candy in the check-out aisle.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I pretty much always say yes if they ask. Candy is cheap and if that is <br/>\n&gt; what they want, it is fine with me.  They only ask once in a while. <br/>\n&gt; Rosie went through a stage of wanting tic-tacs every time we shopped. <br/>\n&gt; So - 75 cents once or twice a week? I can manage that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, that&#39;s reasonable...Plus, our kids always have money.  Which brings up <br/>\nanother thing I am almost afraid to mention...LoL...chores and being paid for <br/>\nwork.  At our home the kids, just by doing one chore a day plus keeping their <br/>\nrooms reasonably straightened, can earn about 30.00 per month.  There are <br/>\nother things we all pitch in to do that are not paid for because we are doing <br/>\nit &#39;for the family&quot; (we are adding onto the house right now) and we never <br/>\nforce anyone to work.  We also have special things needed done that we will <br/>\npay extra for (bringing wood in which EVERYONE hates, for example.)  We never <br/>\nbug anyone to do their chore or their room...it&#39;s all their choice.  But we <br/>\ndo monitor who is doing it and who is not and they are rewarded for it.  They <br/>\nknow that by doing these things, I am paying them because they are taking a <br/>\nbig load off of my back (we have 6 kids at home total, I do about 3 or more <br/>\nloads of laundry per day alone) and because I really appreciate their help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, if they always have money, it does eliminate them even asking for <br/>\nstuff, although I am often buying candy or goodies anyway.  We have a lot of <br/>\nopportunities for one-on-one time  (dr&#39;s appointments, foster care agency <br/>\nmeetings, etc) so it&#39;s so nice to go out to lunch or shopping and treat that <br/>\none kid by themselves :o)  Lots of sharing and discussion when there&#39;s only <br/>\nthe 2 of you in the car.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64510,"nextTopicId":64104}}
