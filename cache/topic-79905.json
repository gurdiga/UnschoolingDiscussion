Thanks for sharing.  I am going to do<br/>\nthe BHAG with my dd tomorrow.  I love these out-of-the-box ideas because it<br/>\nis great to use non-schoolish solutions to &quot;schoolish desires.&quot; Besides, I<br/>\nwonder what kind of BHAGs I can come up with for myself. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nLisa (in IL)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Maybe his desire to fit in (a normal thing) is just stronger right now? Too<br/>\n </span></blockquote>bad you don&#39;t have &gt;some COOL unschoolers to hang with!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But what about buying the Peter Kowalke documentary on grown unschoolers?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe finding &gt;some stories of cool grown unschoolers would help him see the<br/>\npossibilities and help him feel &gt;not so unusual.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another thing I did with the kids last year (and I want to do it with them<br/>\n </span></blockquote>again) is BHAG&#39;S. Big Hairy Audacious Goals. Someone wrote about it in HEM I<br/>\nbelieve (sorry for not remembering the name) and I thought it was really<br/>\ncool. We&#39;d always written down ideas and goals, but I loved the NAME! So we<br/>\nsat down and said what we&#39;d really, really like to do if there were not<br/>\nlimits in our lives. Some were reasonable, some were outrageous, but it gave<br/>\nus a way to focus on that person&#39;s dreams and needs.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We had things like a trip to Disneyworld, building a robot, learning<br/>\n </span></blockquote>guitar (he DID!) and such. Some of them we accomplished, others are still<br/>\npending and yet others have become non-important in that time.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So maybe instead of giving into his schoolish desires (which it sounds<br/>\n </span></blockquote>like he&#39;s not really all that into) ask him for his BHAG&#39;S and share yours<br/>\nwith him.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79902,"nextTopicId":79909}}
