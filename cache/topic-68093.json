Gag!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Laura,<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s not such a selfish thing you wanted for your children after all.  <br/>\nMaybe you really just want them to experience EVERYTHING, the accolades, the <br/>\nawards, the recognition&#39;s, the praise, you know how great your children are <br/>\nand you want the world to recognize that too.  That isn&#39;t so horrible for a <br/>\nmother to want to happen for her children.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust might not be what they want.  I had children who received these &quot;big&quot; <br/>\nsports awards, just last year I went to the &quot;big&quot; sports banquet and was <br/>\nsupposed to meet my baseball player son there.  Coach kept asking me where he <br/>\nwas, they couldn&#39;t start until he got there, they kept dragging things out.  <br/>\nJohn never showed.  He was to receive the &quot;big&quot; award for the athlete of the <br/>\nyear or something to that effect, a really big honor anyway.  John knew, he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to be recognized.  He said he&#39;s a team player, without a team <br/>\nbehind him, he would have never won all the games he did.  So he skipped it.  <br/>\nOn one hand I find that extremely admirable but on the other it looked like <br/>\nhe was really an ungrateful brat that ruined the night for the coaches and <br/>\nother players who wanted to recognize him.  So what did the coach do?  He <br/>\ndidn&#39;t give out the award that night AND he gave it to someone who really <br/>\nwanted it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really a double edged sword of sorts.  Cait volunteers in the Community. <br/>\n She does any number of different things, from reading to preschoolers at a <br/>\ndaycare to helping with the duck race (a local fundraiser), doing clean up on <br/>\nearth day, all kinds of stuff.  Just yesterday she got an invite to a <br/>\nreception honoring the volunteers, she wants no part of it.  She said it&#39;s <br/>\nkinda fake if you do it to get recognition.  I told her that they might think <br/>\nshe&#39;s just being rude if she doesn&#39;t show up.  She still doesn&#39;t want to go, <br/>\nso she won&#39;t be attending.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my other children were to receive a similar award several years ago <br/>\nfor athletics, she let the coach know that she really didn&#39;t want the award <br/>\nand she wished it would go to someone who really really liked that sort of <br/>\nthing.  That night, when they were announcing the award winners, they called <br/>\nmyself and DH to the front.  They gave US and award for being supportive of <br/>\nthe teams and the school and our child.  Kinda embarrassing since they don&#39;t <br/>\nusually give parent awards at these things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, even if your child had gotten the awards it might not have been a <br/>\npositive experience for them.  My children really dislike recognition for <br/>\nthings like that.  They love sports and being part of a team but don&#39;t like <br/>\nto be singled out for anything that recognizes one over another.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids it really matters too and you can see they are crushed if they <br/>\ndon&#39;t get the award, others are simply embarrassed or don&#39;t feel individuals <br/>\nshould be recognized in a team sport.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou really shouldn&#39;t be so hard on yourself for wanting your child/children <br/>\nto have the FULL experience of growing up.  We all want the world to know <br/>\nwhat great children we have and for them to receive all the accolades the <br/>\nworld can toss at them.  Sometimes they don&#39;t want them though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd let me clarify that you can have a completely FULL experience of growing <br/>\nup without having accolades and awards but in the sense that they are offered <br/>\nup for certain things our children participate in, we as parents can be joy <br/>\nfilled that our child has been so successful at a certain thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany times these awards are meaningless and really come down to a coaches <br/>\npreference instead of actual achievement anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s probably just a very bittersweet time for you since your child is about <br/>\nto enter a different part of their lives journey.  Especially for schooled <br/>\nchildren and the rite of passage that comes with graduation.  I was in tears <br/>\nfor weeks before graduation, cried non stop through sports awards ceremonies, <br/>\nscholarship ceremonies and all the other events that seem to come non stop <br/>\nwith a high school senior.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be a hard time for a mother, be kind to yourself!<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132859234,"authorName":"Paula Sjogerman","from":"Paula Sjogerman &lt;sjogy@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 3445","postDate":"1052400768","msgId":68093,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBREZDNkIwLjFCNDUlc2pvZ3lAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNTIzODAzMTcuNTYyLjQzMzg1Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":68102,"prevInTime":68092,"nextInTime":68096,"topicId":68093,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"on 5/8/03 2:51 AM, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com at ... {{Laura}} Take it easy on yourself, we re just humans, raised in this often bizarro culture.
