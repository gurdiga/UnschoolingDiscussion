They are NOT <br/>\npart-time. They are considered part of the family and live in your home for one <br/>\n<br/>\nyear.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA neighbor of mine worked from home. She had an Aupair that came to their house three full days a week and did not live with them. I&#39;m sure there are differences in agencies and areas. I knew the Aupair personally, because we invited her to the neighbor &quot;moms groups&quot; we started. She had been looking specifically for part time, so maybe that made the difference. She was also relocating over here, don&#39;t know how that affected it all. Maybe the term &quot;nanny&quot; would have fit her better, but she referred to herself as an Aupair, as did her employer.??<br/>\n<br/>\nRen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;There is no way to <br/>\npeace.
