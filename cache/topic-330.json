I&#39;m really enjoying all the posts<br/>\nI&#39;ve had to read in the last two days.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to say to Denise that I live in St. Charles, IL just &quot;up the<br/>\nriver&quot; from Geneva.  It is a small world!  There is quite a large homeschool<br/>\ncommunity here in Illinois and in this area in particular.  I&#39;ve even met a<br/>\nnumber of unschoolers.  My daughters are 5 1/2 and almost 2.  We haven&#39;t<br/>\nstarted to participate in any of the homeschooling activities through any of<br/>\nthe groups but do meet hsers everywhere!LOL    My oldest, Sarah, gets asked<br/>\nher age alot and when she says she&#39;s 5 she is then asked if she&#39;s in<br/>\nKindergarten.  She then says &quot;no&quot; and then her questioner says, &quot;oh you&#39;ll<br/>\ngo next fall?&quot;  Then she says &quot;no I don&#39;t go to school.&quot;  That usually<br/>\nproduces a confused look on their face!  She has started answering with the<br/>\nfact that she homeschools.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I have questions to ask and comments to make but I&#39;m still<br/>\nsemi-lurking until I get all my ducks in a row!  I&#39;m really enjoying the<br/>\ndiscussions so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth in Illinois</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112,"nextTopicId":332}}
