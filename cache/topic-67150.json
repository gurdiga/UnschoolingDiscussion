His book, currently titled, &quot;A<br/>\n&gt;Warrior Reborn&quot;  is about three people from a lost civilization: a chef,<br/>\n&gt;a teenage Royal Guard, and a retired gladiator.  There are also several<br/>\n&gt;subcharacters in this adventure story.

And what  great idea to illustrate it that way. I&#39;ll have<br/>\nto tell my son about that. His internal world of characters and conflicts<br/>\nrevolves around the Lego guys and he&#39;s always telling stories about them.<br/>\nHe&#39;d love to make a visual story about them that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny thing about writing. My son (6) will say that he can&#39;t read, but he<br/>\njust wrote a 8-page book called &quot;Battl in Spase&quot;. It&#39;s totally spelled<br/>\nphonetically, but he wrote out a whole story on his own and illustrated it.<br/>\nI love the different paths they can find.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Since beginning our unschooling journey 2 years ago, I have fought a<br/>\n&gt;fleeting concern that my kids were not writing, and I have listened to<br/>\n&gt;veteran unschoolers who counseled me to let go of my schoolish anxiety<br/>\n&gt;and allow them to find their own way to the knowledge that they will<br/>\n&gt;need for their life paths.  And now, a writer is born.  (Yippee!!!)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s great that you have conquered that particular fear (and it&#39;s such a<br/>\nstrong one in our culture) and allowed him to find this passion in his own<br/>\nway!
