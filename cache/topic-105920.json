Get the book<br/>\nand study on your own over the summer - show them you can reach your goals,<br/>\nif you want to do that as a goal.<br/>\n <br/>\nOr write a book anyway.  What are you doing this summer? :)<br/>\n <br/>\nMy folks told me over and over again that writing was nice, but that I&#39;d<br/>\nnever make a living. Maybe, maybe not, but write if you must. I got into<br/>\ncomputer, paid better and still I came back to writing. Now I write computer<br/>\ncourses, teach online and just wrote a computer book.<br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe eventually I&#39;ll shake off all their layers of worry to be able to<br/>\nwrite a real book.<br/>\n <br/>\nRemember, no one can imprison your mind unless they let you.  So, I was<br/>\nweak. :)  Still working on it. :)<br/>\n <br/>\nBTW, math is cool in some places, when it makes sense. :)  A good teacher<br/>\ncan make all the diff.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf your folks truly won&#39;t let you try something like unschooling, go the<br/>\nother way.  Can you take a course at the local community college?<br/>\n <br/>\nBeing among others who are there because they want to be not have to be and<br/>\nwho think a different way can help you clear your mind and determine your<br/>\ndirection.<br/>\n <br/>\nTake a writing or a math course, or both.  Your best and worst! :)  If you<br/>\ndon&#39;t like the math course, DROP it!  It&#39;s not you!  It&#39;s them.  Math does<br/>\nmake sense. Many math teachers do not (no offense to any math teachers, some<br/>\nare good). :)<br/>\n <br/>\nSummer is coming up.  WRITE THAT BOOK!  Take a class.<br/>\n <br/>\nI wrote my computer book in 3 months - could have been faster if I wasn&#39;t<br/>\nlazy, but that&#39;s just me - as you see, I am verbose. :)<br/>\n <br/>\nTake care, feel free to write! :)<br/>\n <br/>\nc.<br/>\n <br/>\nCindy Fox<br/>\nAuthor of QuickBooks QuickSteps<br/>\nwww.cindyfox.com &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cindyfox.com/\">http://www.cindyfox.com/</a>&gt; <br/>\nButterfly Consulting LLC<br/>\n602-692-8923<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of flameforsaken<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 10, 2005 8:50 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] How do I get out?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHiya.<br/>\nI&#39;m fourteen years old, I live in Minnesota an hour or so west of <br/>\nMinneapolis and I attend the Minnetonka Middle School West. <br/>\n<br/>\nTell you the truth, I&#39;d rather not.
