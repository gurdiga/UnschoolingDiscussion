I have <br/>\nmissed the input form this group, as I found I did not have the time <br/>\nto peruse the archives.  So I am back, at least temporarily, to see <br/>\nif I have time to sort through the email of this very active list.  I <br/>\nremember when there was nobody here and I asked why things were so <br/>\nquiet, only to discover that I was almost the only member on a brand <br/>\nnew list.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, we are currently working on projects that I just KNOW <br/>\nwill find a resonant chord with some of the folks in this online <br/>\ncommunity.  Foremost among these is planning a move to Western <br/>\nWashington in preperation for the formation of a cohousing ecovillage <br/>\nintentional community.  We are currently looking for more members, <br/>\nand I will post our call for members in another message, for those of <br/>\nyou who might be interested or know someone who might be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, I am interested in hearing from those of you in WA <br/>\nregarding the legal realities of homeschooling in that state.  Feel <br/>\nfree to email me privately if you feel the information may be too <br/>\nspecific to be on topic for the whole list.  I know that the minimum <br/>\nrequired age for addressing schooling in WA is 8yrs and I know that <br/>\nanual testing can be left out of your home education program, in <br/>\nfavor of non-testing based assesment.  I notice that the Wash. <br/>\nHomeschooling Association lists many people/organizations which do <br/>\nassesments, can anyone tell me about these assesments?  Has anyone <br/>\nhere done them?  I am also interested in knowing what the qualifying <br/>\ncourse for parents that is recommended is like.  Any other <br/>\ninformation or experience that anyone with knowledge of homeschooling <br/>\nin WA wants to share would be great (are you listening David?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all!<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18428,"nextTopicId":18443}}
