I enjoy listening to the lively debate about the essence of<br/>\nunschooling and hows and whys of doing it.  My own experience in learning<br/>\nto unschool has been a mix of highs and lows.  The lows include being<br/>\nbadmouthed around the extended family for my steely conviction to<br/>\nunschool and the highs include the personal discoveries of how wonderful<br/>\na person I am and what I have to offer my children as they grow up.  One<br/>\nof the defining moments of discovery was to read a book (reviewed in Home<br/>\nEducation Magazine, I believe) about the vicious effects of our<br/>\nbehaviorism-driven society.  It&#39;s called &quot;Punished By Rewards&quot; by Alfie<br/>\nKohn. The subtitle reads &quot;the trouble with gold stars, incentive plans,<br/>\nA&#39;s, praise, and other bribes.&quot;  After reading that book, curriculum<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t possibly be an option for me!  <br/>\n     That said, I can appreciate that some homeschoolers do stand in a<br/>\nnether world between structured learning and child-led learning.  It is<br/>\ndifficult to find that support which you desire when neither &quot;group&quot; is<br/>\nmatching your interests fully.  Unschooling has traditionally been<br/>\nunderstood to mean &quot;without curriculum&quot; so that is why the passionate<br/>\nwords to keep this list &quot;curriculum free&quot;.  I take what I need from the<br/>\ndialog and respect that which I don&#39;t need.  If this list becomes a<br/>\ndefinitive outpost for all those seeking support and information on<br/>\nunschooling, all the better!  <br/>\n    <br/>\n     Carol <br/>\n___________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet the Internet just the way you want it.<br/>\nFree software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!<br/>\nTry Juno Web: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.\">http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":925,"nextTopicId":931}}
