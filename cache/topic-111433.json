During the four-day count of  <br/>\nFebruary 18-21, birders across North America reported more than 6.5  <br/>\nmillion birds, shattering the previous record of 4.8 million set in  <br/>\n2002. Participants submitted nearly 52,000 checklists, up 22 percent  <br/>\nfrom last year, and tallied 613 bird species, surpassing the previous  <br/>\nrecord of 567. More than 1,000 photos were considered for the new  <br/>\nonline photo gallery, which features birds seen from around the  <br/>\ncontinent during the count. At the GBBC web site, you can visit the  <br/>\nphoto gallery, explore the results, and view the top-10 lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nParticipants recorded birds in all 50 states and all but one Canadian  <br/>\nprovince and territory, capturing the tremendous geographic variation  <br/>\nin birds across the continent, from the 10 species reported in the  <br/>\nNorthwest Territories to the 377 species reported from Texas.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\nAnswers to common unschooling questions:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a><br/>\nBlog of writing prompts for speculative fiction writers:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dragonwritingprompts.blogsome.com/\">http://dragonwritingprompts.blogsome.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111422,"nextTopicId":111448}}
