This would be ideal, of course, but for those families already dealing with this problem, is there a specific course of action the parent could take when being repeatedly and painfully struck by the child?  I wish I had better answers but, thankfully, we haven&#39;t had this problem crop up so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have to say that the hitting would be sufficient cause for intervention of a sort in my home.  This behavior would absolutely not be tolerated at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, home should be a **safe** place.  Secondly, I consider intentional hurting of another to be vicious and unacceptable.  I would not allow my significant other to beat me or my children, therefore I will not allow my children to beat others, myself included.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have physically intervened when a stranger drew back her arm to strike my son (then 3) in a grocery store because he tripped and fell against her legs.  Had she actually succeeded in striking my son, I am quite sure that I would have been facing legal consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that some people will take exception to the words &quot;allow&quot; and &quot;tolerate.&quot;  I understand that placing rules and restrictions on others removes some of their freedoms.
