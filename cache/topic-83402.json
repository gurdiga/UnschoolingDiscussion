I am still <br/>\nbeside <br/>\nmy self on that one. How is this possible one and two how could anyone be <br/>\ncomfortable writing it as an anti-video game defense? <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are maybe 2 or 3 of us on this list of 200 that Unschool what does one <br/>\nsay to this as a minority on a list? <br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br/>\n<br/>\nIf in fact what this mom wrote is true, and she wrote this as a response or a <br/>\nstatement of fact that unschooling does not work then the logic is flawed. <br/>\nShe starts right of saying that she *Let the child play for one day* that isn&#39;t <br/>\nunschooling, that is her &quot;allowing&quot; a child to play something that is usually <br/>\nheavily restricted. The child was so enthralled at the so called freedom he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t drag himself away for even a moment. I find it hard to believe a <br/>\nchild of nine or ten would defecate on himself just to keep that freedom for <br/>\none moment longer, but if it is true then it speaks volumes about the mom <br/>\nherself. The fact that she then dragged her child away screaming shows that the <br/>\nchild was very aware that the one day of freedom was a ploy on the mothers part <br/>\nand not truly a day of freedom. If she was really trying unschooling then she <br/>\nwould have had to give it more than just a day. And she probably spent most of <br/>\nthe day making comments about when he was going to get off, and how nice a <br/>\nday it was to spend outside, and wouldn&#39;t he like to read some in his book... <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I really think is mean is having a game system and then locking it up. <br/>\nThat is like having something always and being allowed to look and see and know <br/>\nit is there but never ever touch it. My toys were like that when I was a <br/>\nchild. I had many but I wasn&#39;t allowed to play with them because I would mess them <br/>\nup or I would make a mess, so when I was allowed to play with my toys I did <br/>\nmake a mess. I was so excited to be able to play with them I didn&#39;t know which <br/>\none to play with first and would drag them all out. That, of course, proved my <br/>\nmothers theory that I would make a mess if allowed the freedom to just play <br/>\nunrestricted. So unless my mother had the time to sit and control the <br/>\nsituation, I was resigned to looking and wanting. When my sister came onto the scene <br/>\nwhen I was seven and then when I was nine and my brother came along, they <br/>\nstarted getting all these cool toys and they were allowed to play with them and that <br/>\nwasn&#39;t fair. To add insult to injury I didn&#39;t get toys anymore, I got books <br/>\nand clothes. And not that books and clothes are bad, but when you spend all of <br/>\nyour first years being smothered with no and don&#39;t and can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t and <br/>\nbetter not and wait till your father gets home and then two small creatures <br/>\ncome along and get everything you ever wanted, well it just hurts and it drives <br/>\nhome the word crap. So if this boy has this hundred dollar game system with <br/>\nforty dollar a pop games and isn&#39;t ever allowed to play unless the situation is <br/>\ncontrolled then I can see why he did what he did. And every time he sees a <br/>\ngame he wants and has to &quot;earn&quot; it and then has to &quot;earn&quot; time to play it then I <br/>\nunderstand that drive to never leave one spot for that justified fear of <br/>\nreprisal on the mom&#39;s part. He knew he would be punished for spending the whole <br/>\nday on the games, but it was almost worth it or else why would he have done what <br/>\nhe did? The child did what he did because it was expected that he would do <br/>\nthat. Probably every day he asks to play and every day he is told &quot;If I let you <br/>\nplay you will never get off, you will rot your brain playing that junk.&quot; The <br/>\ngame is like candy. Only allowed on certain special occasions and if he &quot;earns&quot; <br/>\nthe time. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot unschooling. Not even close. No wonder it didn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nGenius may have its limitations, but stupidity is not thus handicapped. <br/>\nElbert Hubbard <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83420,"nextTopicId":83422}}
