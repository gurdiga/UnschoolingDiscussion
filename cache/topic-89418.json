That would be a rather simplistic explanation.<br/>\n It means we are separated from God.  Christ<br/>\nreconciled us back to Himself on Easter morning out of<br/>\nhis great love for us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a much longer, theological explanation, CS<br/>\nLewis and Francis Schaeffer do it much better than I,<br/>\nand that isn&#39;t my point here.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, living in fear of hell fire and damnation would<br/>\nbe terribly stressful.

Faith that my God who<br/>\nplanted this faith inside me also planted it inside my<br/>\nchildren.  Faith that by trying my best to model<br/>\ngenuine faith before their eyes and by answering their<br/>\nquestions, and asking their forgiveness when I make<br/>\nmistakes, the faith inside them will be nurtured and<br/>\ngrow, and when they are old they won&#39;t depart from it.<br/>\n But faithful to model it before them, regardless of<br/>\nhow the outcome looks.  Ultimately, Totally, from the<br/>\nbeginning, it is between them and God.<br/>\n<br/>\nI live by faith, not by fear.  So I can unschool, and<br/>\ntrust God, and believe that the same God who can<br/>\nrescue me from hell can rescue them, and He will.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBy faith.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really hope my children do start to question, and<br/>\nwonder, and test the boundaries.  Because then I know<br/>\nthat that seed that God placed in there is starting to<br/>\ngrow and become their own faith.  I think I will<br/>\nrejoice when it starts to happen (well, ok, the 14yo<br/>\nis already there...LOL!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I am not going to post much any more on this<br/>\nsubject, because I feel I am starting to get preachy<br/>\nand no one likes a preachy unschooler ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGoodnight, List!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n--Susan in VA<br/>\nWifetoVegman<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.
