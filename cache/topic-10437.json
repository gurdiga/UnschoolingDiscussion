I vowed then to<br/>\nlive a life of &#39;no regrets&#39;. My every moment was harrowed by guilt and<br/>\nshame. I felt guilty for being alive. Everything that happened in a day was<br/>\n&#39;my fault&#39; in my mind whether I had anything to do with it or not. Saying<br/>\n&#39;no regrets&#39; for every moment of my life - that is everything that ever<br/>\nhappens to me is a good and positive thing, no matter what direction or<br/>\nwhat consequence, it is for my greater good and I WILL see the learning in<br/>\nevery moment by becoming as aware as possible and looking for the positive,<br/>\nwas the first step in the road to recovery of self esteem for me. Twenty<br/>\nyears later I had a breakdown that finally allowed me to let go of the<br/>\nremnant guilt attached to such a damaged childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of things in life that don&#39;t happen the way I want them to<br/>\nright now. But I learn to see that what is happening right now has very<br/>\nvaluable lessons for me... lessons that my conscious mind might not bring<br/>\nmy way. I value what does come my way... I live for each and every moment,<br/>\nnot future or past moments. <br/>\n<br/>\nLiving without &#39;regrets&#39; is incredibly empowering and makes my life so much<br/>\nmore satisfying. It is, above all else, just an attitude. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt also frees me up from the baggage my parents would place on me, with<br/>\ncomments like &quot;you could have been successful&quot; - I AM successful, I am a<br/>\nwonderful parent, a dedicated homeschooling pioneer and networker, a<br/>\npermaculturalist, tread lightly on the earth, good financial manager, home<br/>\nbuilder.... I just don&#39;t live like they do, and I don&#39;t have any regrets in<br/>\nlife!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was ten I dreamed of writing novels. When I was twenty I knew that I<br/>\nwould be &#39;mature&#39; enough to do this at forty.... When I was seventeen I<br/>\ntold my lover that we would know what love is, really is, when we were<br/>\nsixty... I am a patient person and know that time enriches my life, not<br/>\ndetracts from it. Every moment is a learning lesson for me, and I count my<br/>\nblessings! <br/>\n<br/>\nI am writing novels now, I am self publishing homeschooling books, I play<br/>\nwith a &#39;business&#39;... I prioritise my time carefully so that I can do what I<br/>\nneed and want to do in all areas of my life. If I feel strongly about an<br/>\nissue I attend to it. I don&#39;t sacrifice anything in my life for my family<br/>\nor homeschooling... <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that has astounded me about all of this is how it has affected<br/>\nthe children&#39;s personal development - and often how they have shown me the<br/>\nway to stay true to my &#39;no regrets&#39; policy in life. I think it is all about<br/>\nhonouring oneself and having realistic expectations of one&#39;s abilities,<br/>\nlimitations, and knowing one&#39;s own boundaries and self.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers,<br/>\nBeverley <br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out Joel&#39;s HOMESCHOOLING EXPO web page<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dove.net/dosborne/expo\">http://www.dove.net/dosborne/expo</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAuthor &quot;Getting Started with Homeschooling - Practical Considerations&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;Learning in the Absence of Education - Essays on Homeschooling&quot;, both $19<br/>\nfrom B Paine, PO Box 371 Yankalilla 5203<br/>\n<br/>\nSA HOMESCHOOLING EXPO Saturday 22nd July - Celebrating and showcasing the<br/>\ndiversity of homeschooling practice in South Australia!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"NumoAstro@aol.com","from":"NumoAstro@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"0O1E2Izi75cQ5qN7IKvAyI2ccJwDz2t-3Swu0z-3GeZxmCpQb7_Uq2m_QB_K54ik0xB_gTucZk4","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] supporting needy mothers","postDate":"962721277","msgId":10547,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlhLjZiZDUxNjQuMjY5MzRmZmRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":10541,"nextInTopic":10584,"prevInTime":10546,"nextInTime":10548,"topicId":10437,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/4/2000 6:56:50 AM US Mountain Standard Time, cathie_98@hotmail.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-675915532\">In a message dated 7/4/2000 6:56:50 AM US Mountain Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cathie_98@...\">cathie_98@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve encouraged myself-its not too late-wonder what I could get into now? <br/>\nI <br/>\n hate to think how many regrets I will have when I am almost 80 if I wait <br/>\n another 15 years til everyone is grown up &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Cathie for your honesty...

Prior to the Regency (50 years before Victoria)<br/>\nand the rise of industrialism, it is true that teenagers were expected to<br/>\nhave babies, and expected to have more responsibility. BUT, it was also<br/>\nassumed that people would live in extended family groupings, with family<br/>\nmembers all around them, and that grandparents (specifically, the maternal<br/>\ngrandmother) would take a major role in teaching a mother how to care for<br/>\nand raise a child, and, in fact, would take much of the responsibility on<br/>\nherself.  The idea of doting, distant grandparents is a creation of the same<br/>\nmodern industrial system that produced public education -- nuclear families<br/>\nwere created by an industrial system which needed a mother at whom to raise<br/>\nthe new labor force, while men were slaving away in factories, far away from<br/>\ntheir &quot;natural&quot; base of support in agrarian communities.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it might be said that earlier societies also had an extended &quot;childhood&quot;<br/>\n-- it just included raising children!
