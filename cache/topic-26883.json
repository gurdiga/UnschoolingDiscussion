Green <br/>\nDolphin Street by Elizabeth Goudge. Both of my daughters loved it <br/>\nwhen they were teenagers and they still count it as one of their <br/>\nfavorite books. You probably couldn&#39;t find a new copy but your <br/>\nlibrary might have it and used copies are pretty easy to come by on <br/>\neBay and half.com. There&#39;s a pretty good bit of history in it and <br/>\nperhaps it&#39;s well researched! I&#39;m not sure about that but it&#39;s a <br/>\ngreat read anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nPriss<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., Campbell &lt;wegirls@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi there, We are reading about NZ and Australia and I am looking <br/>\nfor any<br/>\n&gt; good resources out there.
