I decided that Kenna needed to read the Little House books. I got tons of them from the library and the yard sales and left them lying around. She didn&#39;t take the bait and getting more and more &#39;weirded out&#39; I pushed her to read one. I know, bad mommy. She hated it! She would much rather be reading Anne McCaffrey or Piers Anthony or Tamora Pierce. So I read them. They were pretty bad, but I felt better. I&#39;ve found my most panicky times are when I want to learn more. So now I&#39;ll let myself learn and then I&#39;m much more relaxed with the kids. Takes care of the demon for awhile.<br/>\nThis also happens at my house. I like table puzzles and when I ask my sons  <br/>\nthey never want to do them .  So I started buying them for myself with themes  <br/>\nthey would like and start doing them. Sure enough I have all the help I need!  <br/>\nIt takes us about a week to do them and my boys all enjoy it. But if I ask  <br/>\nthem to do the puzzle they&#39;d say &#39;No way!&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n~kathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"serrtana@aol.com","from":"serrtana@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"yDargsySN5KQrYVDQY2NdwapoKjtA2PKB_JDoe0QZ1-h5wW0A3bZYaQNvg7Vso0xSOf1V_-oAQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] puzzle fun","postDate":"997628185","msgId":23171,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDliLjE5NTIyZjkyLjI4YTdmMzE5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23178,"prevInTime":23170,"nextInTime":23172,"topicId":23171,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1742819044\">&lt;&lt; I like crossword puzzle books.
