Lupus, among other things, can be <br/>\nindicated with a high ANA.  How high was yours?  Did your doctor tell you <br/>\nwith what pattern the ANA came back?  Different patterns can suggest <br/>\ndifferent diseases.  Any of the autoimmune diseases are a possibility - <br/>\nrheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren&#39;s syndrome, Raynaud&#39;s, scleroderma, and others. <br/>\n Keep careful track of what kind of symptoms you have.  I assume since you <br/>\nwere thinking of fibromyalgia that pain and fatigue are key symptoms for you. <br/>\n Once you begin observing your body closely you may notice others.  Of course <br/>\nit&#39;s not helpful to dwell on our symptoms forever, but at this point it is <br/>\nimportant to notice as many as possible, with as much detail as possible.  <br/>\nThis will be helpful information for your doctor.   <br/>\nHere is a great site that will give you tons of information:<br/>\nwww.lupus.org  <br/>\nTry clicking on the button for &quot;Causes, Symptoms, Testing, and Treatment&quot;.  <br/>\nLots of good information there.  <br/>\nIf you want to discuss this further off-list I would be happy to.  I&#39;ve been <br/>\nin your position and it was actually a huge relief to me when I was diagnosed <br/>\nwith lupus because I could finally put a name on it.  My ANA ranges anywhere <br/>\nfrom 0:10 to 0:6800.  Autoimmune disorders are tricky - especially lupus, <br/>\nbecause it can mimic virtually any other disease.  Good luck and I hope you <br/>\nfeel better.  <br/>\nKIM</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7305,"nextTopicId":7334}}
