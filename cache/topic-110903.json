Have hubby pitch in<br/>\nand help get the house stuff done when the kids are<br/>\ndown for the night. Also try to stay relaxed. Babies<br/>\nare so sensitive to our signals and emotions and<br/>\nespecially evenning tends to get to be a busy time for<br/>\nlots of us.<br/>\nDo not panic about your guy who wants his bottle. I<br/>\nliked getting special cups from the dollar store, you<br/>\nknow ones with Santas at Christmas, whatever. Then at<br/>\nmeal times have the cups out. He will ask when he<br/>\nwants one. It is fun to use theme cups for the older<br/>\nkids too. My kids still want them. And my little ones<br/>\ngenerally do not want to be far behind the older ones.<br/>\nNo pressure from you just the availability of another<br/>\noption. <br/>\nKim are you interested in moving towards unschooling? <br/>\nJust Curious,<br/>\nKathleen<br/>\n&quot;Your focus is your reality&quot; Qui Gon Jin or however<br/>\nyou spell his name.. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
