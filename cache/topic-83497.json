He <br/>\nwasn&#39;t 8 yet. (And he still doesn&#39;t have his driver&#39;s license at 25.) Come <br/>\nto think of it, *I* read those books when I was about 14, so you know two <br/>\nmore. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I&#39;ve told Noah&#39;s story here. He had really poor fine motor <br/>\ncontrol. He had a choice that year (grade 2). He could take his time and <br/>\nreally make his work neat . . . and get in trouble for not finishing on <br/>\ntime, or he could get it finished on time . . . and watch the teacher throw <br/>\nit into the wastebasket for being messy. I took him out of school at <br/>\nChristmas. At the time he never read for pleasure, only if it was required. <br/>\nThey had watched the video of Charlotte&#39;s Web that last day at school. <br/>\nAfter school I handed him the book, thinking he might enjoy the original <br/>\nillustrations. He read almost the whole book that afternoon and evening. <br/>\nThe evening part was at a noisy party we went to. This is the kid who <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t concentrate in class. He read another couple of books at that <br/>\nlevel, then read The Hobbit and started Fellowship. His teacher had *no <br/>\nidea* that he could read that well because he couldn&#39;t handle the written, <br/>\nprove-you-read-it, work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI came as close as I could to unschooling him with my unsupportive ex <br/>\nbreathing down my back until the beginning of grade 4. At that point I was <br/>\n8 months pregnant, and the ex threatened me with court if I didn&#39;t put him <br/>\nback in school. I couldn&#39;t see how I was going to manage a court case with <br/>\na nursing infant, and Noah didn&#39;t want me to fight it anymore, so I put him <br/>\nin school. After a year he went to live with the ex. I often wonder how he <br/>\nwould have turned out if he hadn&#39;t gone back to school. In my opinion he <br/>\nwas beginning to thrive at home. As it is, he lives in a tent in the bush <br/>\nand dumpster-dives for a &quot;living&quot;.
