There are certain<br/>\nenvironmental requirements that must be met to satisfy the law as well as<br/>\nCoast Guard requirements concerning boating.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor full body burial at sea:<br/>\nCan an uncremated body legally be buried at sea in the United States?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe simple answer to this is yes.  There are many restrictions and<br/>\nrequirements, however, the least of which concern maritime issues.  Many<br/>\ncounty health departments will not release a body to a captain for sea<br/>\nburial.  While this issue could probably be overcome, the cost and time<br/>\nspent attempting to win a decision against a government agency could be<br/>\noppressive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\nWould a direct burial at sea be expensive?<br/>\n<br/>\nA full body buried at sea must be placed in waters of a specified depth,<br/>\nmainly to insure that the body remains at the ocean&#39;s floor.  To reach the<br/>\nrequired depth can require a long journey in an ocean-going vessel.<br/>\nDepending on the time of year, weather and sea conditions, special vessels<br/>\nor crew members may be required.  The costs of a 16-hour trip from New York<br/>\nHarbor, as an example, could be quite costly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny burial costs would be compounded by traditional funeral costs, if<br/>\ndesired, such as preparing the deceased for viewing and transporting the<br/>\nremains to the vessel.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdded to this are the costs associated with any legal actions necessary to<br/>\ninsure release of the body by county or state officials.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy can&#39;t I perform a full sea burial myself?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf an individual was apprised of all applicable laws and regulations,<br/>\nsecured any necessary permits and had the proper craft to transport the<br/>\nremains into the ocean, he could probably find a place where he could<br/>\nlegally perform a sea burial himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the sake of the environment, for your safety and out of respect for the<br/>\nlaw, do not perform a sea burial without being certain you comply with local<br/>\nand national regulations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\nHere are the URLs<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.seaservices.com/\">http://www.seaservices.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cburial.com/directburial.htm##1\">http://www.cburial.com/directburial.htm##1</a><br/>\nTook about 2 minutes.<br/>\n~Elissa Cleaveland<br/>\n&quot;It is nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction<br/>\nhave<br/>\nnot yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry.&quot; A.
