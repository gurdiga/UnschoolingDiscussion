It&#39;s a tough one for some adults to learn :-).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen this thread before, and I never quite believe it.  I mean -<br/>\nNEVER saying no??  If someone told me they never say no to their spouse, I<br/>\nwould consider that unhealthy.  I think every relationship has to have room<br/>\nfor a good solid no.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest, I think that the real problem is when the kids are not allowed<br/>\nto say no to the parents, but hear no all the time.  THAT was my frustration<br/>\nas a kid, and something I try to keep balanced with my kids (often<br/>\nunsuccessfully &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nH.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a><br/>\nReply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Fri, 6 Sep 2002 13:22:39 EDT<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] more no&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 9/6/2002 11:14:07 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:the_colbecks@...\">the_colbecks@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   I do<br/>\n&gt; always seek the &#39;yes&#39;, but sometimes, for me, the answer is just no.
