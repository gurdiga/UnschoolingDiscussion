G Patton]).  It ruins people&#39;s lives.  Cops who think they have killed innocent people because the high speed drivers they were chasing ran into someone, or shoot kids with [toy] guns, or ambulance drivers who remove dead children from wrecks.  Fact: IT DESTROYS LIVES!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here&#39;s a kicker:  you can get it from living in fear - it&#39;s called PROGRESSIVE Critical Incident Stress and I know it well.  Comes from the craziness of a rage-o-holic father who hit a lot!  Who beat my little brother&#39;s ass black and blue with his belt. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr from being bullied at school/work.  And IMHO opinion, it&#39;s MORALLY wrong!  Even a little spanking can lead to this condition. Even a little spanking is morally wrong!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thots<br/>\nTim T   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And I very much doubt that<br/>\n&gt; children who are struck in rare emergencies waste much time on <br/>\n&gt; resentment<br/>\n&gt; either, especially in a culture where this is considered perfectly <br/>\n&gt; normal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76980,"nextTopicId":77002}}
