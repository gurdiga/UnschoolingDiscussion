I have raised <br/>\nleader puppies for several years and the school we are affiliated with does <br/>\nnot discourage interaction with the family pets and in fact encourages off <br/>\nleash play with the family dogs.

They are half border collie.  I am attempting to teach them<br/>\n&gt; manners, etc., hoping a service dog organization will take them in a few<br/>\n&gt; months.  Here is the dilemma.  The farthest I have ever gotten in dog<br/>\n&gt; training is &quot;sit&quot;.  I have read lots of books but they all deal with a<br/>\n&gt; single dog.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have crate trained the pups in their own crates.  They have time to spend<br/>\n&gt; playing just with each other and times they are in our half-acre pen with<br/>\n&gt; our adult dogs.  I have been trying to use a &quot;lead&quot; system, where the dog is<br/>\n&gt; attached to me on a 4-foot lead in the house or attached to a short lead in<br/>\n&gt; their &quot;settle down&quot; area.  We have lots of toys, bones, etc..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been working with them one at a time.  Does this sound on track at<br/>\n&gt; all or could someone recommend a good book?  Just wanting to do what I can<br/>\n&gt; to try to help these pups find a more suitable home than our very pet-heavy<br/>\n&gt; one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Julie--with 4 dogs, 6 goats, 30 chickens, 10 rabbits, 1 cat and 1 newborn<br/>\n&gt; rat </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47338,"nextTopicId":47379}}
