It is very rare for a child younger than<br/>\n18 months to wean cold turkey.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could call 1-800-LA-LECHE to get a phone number for a leader near you<br/>\nand she can give you all sorts of tips for getting him back on (faster<br/>\nthan we can type!)<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, you should express milk to relieve your engorgement and keep milk<br/>\nsupply up.  Try nursing him when he is sleepy, or in the tub.  Could also<br/>\ngive him expressed milk by cup.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope he feels better soon.  I&#39;m sure it helped to get that great fluid<br/>\nwhile he was sick!  BTW, doctors in the know will recommend breastfeeding<br/>\nover stuff like pediolyte for sick kids.  It is considered a clear fluid<br/>\nand is very quickly and easily digested.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nGain weight... Stay Active...
