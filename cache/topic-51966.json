My velour tree skirt was covered in hair and I <br/>\njust couldn&#39;t keep it clean for more than an hour. So I cleaned it one last <br/>\ntime, wrapped all the gifts and put them under the tree. Cats can&#39;t get to <br/>\nit now. I thought after my 2 year old started to ask to open them that it <br/>\nwas a mistake. But she surprised me as usual and has been very good. No <br/>\nshaking or anything. She understands now that on Christmas she can open <br/>\nsome. Of course she has no idea when that is so every day she asks. She also <br/>\ngoes and shows everyone how we have Merry Christmas under the tree! Aren&#39;t <br/>\nkids just the best??!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.
