If the next one is because the kids are fighting, STILL <br/>\nkeep in mind that you want this interaction to do something positive <br/>\nfor your relationship with the kids and stretch your thinking as to how <br/>\nyou can make that happen. In other words, you kind of think from their <br/>\npoint of view about yourself. Consider what thoughts you want going <br/>\nthrough their head. Do you want them thinking: &quot;She never takes time to <br/>\neven find out what the problem is?&quot; Or, &quot;She always blames me?&quot; Or, <br/>\n&quot;She&#39;s such a hypocrite, doesn&#39;t want to hear us yelling, but then she <br/>\nyells at us.&quot; &quot;She hates me.&quot; And so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you want them to be thinking - what words (articulated or not) <br/>\ndo want tumbling around inside their head? Maybe, &quot;She understands how <br/>\nI feel.&quot; Or, &quot;She really cares about helping us solve our problems.&quot; <br/>\nOr, &quot;She is trying hard to be fair.&quot; Or, &quot;She&#39;s calm even when I&#39;m <br/>\nnot.&quot; Or, &quot;Mom is the best listener in the world.&quot; &quot;Mom loves me even <br/>\nwhen I&#39;m causing problems.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, eventually, you want them to think like this?<br/>\n&quot;Mom will help us find a solution.&quot; &quot;I can stay calm like mommy does <br/>\neven when I&#39;m mad.&quot; &quot;I can listen carefully like mommy does when there <br/>\nis a conflict.&quot; &quot;I can recognize feelings, like mommy.&quot;  &quot;I can come up <br/>\nwith new ideas, like mommy does when we have trouble.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no substitute for being authentically &quot;there&quot; for them - for <br/>\ngenuinely trying to help them resolve problems.

It&#39;s hard for me not<br/>\nto just react sometimes, but I will keep trying.  I remember being<br/>\nso much more relaxed and playful with my older son when he was<br/>\nlittle.  I was so much younger and less stressed out, I guess.  He<br/>\nwas easy and there was only one of him.  Now I am having trouble not<br/>\nfeeling resentful, guilty and tired-out.  I do have moments when I<br/>\nam being very mindful in my interactions with my children, where I<br/>\nfeel true compassion for them and remember that they are young and<br/>\nlearning, and my love for them flows easily and abundantly.  At<br/>\nthose times, I can more easily figure out what they need and I am<br/>\nmore creative in my efforts to help them. I just wish I could be<br/>\nthat mindful and peaceful more often.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Perhaps you could try getting some occasional help in tidying from<br/>\n </span></blockquote>an<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; outside source - a mother&#39;s helper, a local teen intermittently,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>or perhaps<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you could actually employ your daughter for a specific task for a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>specific<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; time frame.

I&#39;m quite money poor at the moment, so I<br/>\ncan&#39;t pay her that way, but I do reward her in other ways (she<br/>\ncollects shells and when I find a particularly nice one, I give it<br/>\nto her as a thank you.  I also spend time with just her after the<br/>\nkids go to bed, even when I&#39;d just rather be alone.  She enjoys<br/>\nthis, I think (as do I most of the time!)  I will say that she is<br/>\nevery bit as messy as they are if not more so.  She is her mother&#39;s<br/>\nonly child, and is only with me temporarily.  Her mother has never<br/>\nexpected her to clean up after herself and is very relaxed about<br/>\nclutter.  (how I wish I could be that way at times!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, part of the reason I&#39;m feeling so overwhelmed is because<br/>\nsince Sarah has been here, my four year old, Stella, wants to do<br/>\nnothing but play with her big sister.  When I ask her to help me<br/>\ntidy her room for instance, she answers, &quot;No.  I&#39;m playing with<br/>\nSarah&quot; in a really snotty voice.  This really ticks me off<br/>\nsometimes.  Her attitude towards me is so ugly when her sister is<br/>\nhere.  So, I guess there is a tradeoff in having Sarah&#39;s help.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One thing that some folks use is to spread out a large groundsheet<br/>\n </span></blockquote>on which<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to do art work or puzzles.

I could do<br/>\nthis in the patio area of the house we are in, and actually we<br/>\nalready do use the patio for particularly messy art.  The huge patio<br/>\nis enclosed, the floors are concrete and since it still has much of<br/>\nthe owners construction mess in it and isn&#39;t a place where I want to<br/>\nhang out, I don&#39;t really care what the kids do in it.  They have<br/>\nbeen painting in there and playing with chalk.  I even let them just<br/>\nleave the paints out and I periodically check and see if the brushes<br/>\nneed caring for, etc...  This is huge for me!  My natural tendency<br/>\nis to nag them about taking care of their things, and to put<br/>\neverything in it&#39;s place again.  :)  A drawback to the patio is that<br/>\nit isn&#39;t heated, and we live on the Washington coast where it often<br/>\ngets chilly even in summer.  I suppose we could put a space heater<br/>\nin there for those days, although it&#39;s huge and un-insulated, so<br/>\nthat could be expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do feel badly about banishing them from the house to play.  I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t asked them how they feel about it, though.  If we spruce up<br/>\na particular area with shelves for their puzzles and supplies, it<br/>\ncould be their very own baby-free play-space!  They may go for that<br/>\nand if they have some say in how it&#39;s set up, they&#39;ll really be<br/>\nhappy.  It could be a new project!  Especially with dad coming--he<br/>\ncould help by building the shelves or whatever. I know they want to<br/>\nfind a mutually agreeable solution to the problems we&#39;ve been<br/>\nhaving.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Rather than trying to baby proof the whole house or restrict the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>older ones<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in their activities to one place, perhaps you can make a &quot;safe<br/>\n </span></blockquote>room&quot; or<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; fenced off area for the baby to be mobile and free in.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Believe me, this would be a wonderful option, except the floor plan<br/>\nin this house prevents it, unless I wanted to gate him inside one of<br/>\nthe bedrooms, which I wouldn&#39;t do.  He likes to be a part of the<br/>\naction too much and I wouldn&#39;t be able to supervise him.  As it is,<br/>\nhe really screeches when all the girls are outside and he can see<br/>\nthem through the sliding glass door or the low window, but can&#39;t go<br/>\nout himself because I&#39;m busy inside.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In terms of things on their beds - I would try the idea of picking<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; battles initially - obviously the long term idea is to not have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>any battles.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Their rooms should be their rooms, and not held to the same<br/>\n </span></blockquote>standard as the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; public or shared areas of the house.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I tend to agree with and strive for this, even though I have trouble<br/>\nwith it (I hate going into their room to help them dress or tell<br/>\nthem bedtime stories, only to step on and break a toy that was<br/>\nhidden under some clothes on the floor--it hurts and they&#39;re out<br/>\nanother toy!)This is something I have been specifically working on.<br/>\nIn fact, I privately decided to ignore the mess in their room--just<br/>\nlet it be however they wanted it.  I succeeded for about 36 hours!<br/>\nI just couldn&#39;t stand that clean and dirty clothes were left all<br/>\nover the room, along with puzzle pieces(all mixed together willy<br/>\nnilly) and library books (I have to point out damage to a book<br/>\nnearly every time I return them to the library!) and markers and<br/>\npastels, etc...  Besides the fact they can&#39;t possibly enjoy their<br/>\nthings if they are lost, hidden or broken, the house doesn&#39;t belong<br/>\nto me and I don&#39;t want them ruining the (unfortunately)white carpets<br/>\nwith art supplies.
