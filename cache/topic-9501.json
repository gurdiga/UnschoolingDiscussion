There are also several Christian based groups <br/>\nif I had wanted to have religion as a prominent part of our lives.  I&#39;ve <br/>\ntalked to a couple of mothers already and feeling a lot better about my <br/>\ndecision.  I know logically that it makes sense.  Something one of them told <br/>\nme was that I would probably end up changing all my friends as the ones I <br/>\nhave now, who don&#39;t homeschool or unschool, will probably feel threatened by <br/>\nwhat I&#39;m doing and to expect a backlash.  However she also said there is tons <br/>\nof support for what we want to do as well... We&#39;ve had the same experience <br/>\nwith Zak and the preschool.

It lasted from Aug- the end of Nov.  My son <br/>\nbegan wanting me to be there all of the time, because I often helped out.  On <br/>\ndays that I was not going, he did not want to go either.  Also, he did not <br/>\nlike the idea of having to conform to the group, and do things like sing and <br/>\nmarch around the room with al of the other kids.  He just never liked the <br/>\nidea of doing something just because the group was doing it.  They had a <br/>\nThanksgiving program in Nov, where the kids were to wear Pilgrim hats and <br/>\nsing songs.  When the time came, John would NOT have anything to do with it <br/>\nat all.  He absolutely had no interest in taking part.  All the while, I was <br/>\nconsidering homeschooling for my kids, and this helped confirm the decision <br/>\nto do so.  There was not anything specifically &quot;wrong&quot; with the preschool <br/>\nprogram;  it just did not match the needs that my child had.  He requires <br/>\nmore freedom, and less conformity than traditional schooling offers.  Forcing <br/>\nhim to go to school would not be in his best interest.  Who knows down the <br/>\nroad how things  will go; but for now, this is the best decision for him.  We <br/>\nhave 2 more children that are younger than John, and at this time, we plan to <br/>\nhomeschool them, too.  Your question about  would you be neglecting your <br/>\nchild if he was not initiating an area of learning...  Your child is always <br/>\nlearning, even if it does not look like it.  Unschooling is something that <br/>\ntakes a &quot;leap of faith&quot;.  It takes trusting your child.  It takes knowing <br/>\nthat your child wants to learn innately, and as you go along, you will find <br/>\nthere are highs and lows.  Times of busy, explosive learning, and times where <br/>\nyou wonder if your kid is a slug!  Take time to read as muchas you can on <br/>\nhome/unschooling.  There are a lot of great books and web sites available.  <br/>\nHope this is not too long!  Take care~Karen in Ind</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9470,"nextTopicId":9512}}
