But I also think the list is heavily ladened at the<br/>\nmoment with two people who aren&#39;t unschooling children deciding what are and<br/>\nwhat aren&#39;t worthwhile topics for this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nPamS brought up some especially well articulated points. Bob, while we do<br/>\ndiscuss a wide range of topics here and the discussions can be very thought<br/>\nprovoking -- I&#39;ve certainly found unschooling parents to be among the most<br/>\ninteresting people to discuss things with -- that isn&#39;t the purpose of this<br/>\nlist. Since you aren&#39;t here to discuss unschooling your child, apparently<br/>\nyou&#39;re here to debate the people here.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;d like to debate unschoolers on various topics you can try the<br/>\nUnschooling.com debate folder. (Deb&#39;s going to hurl rotten tomatoes at me<br/>\nfor that suggestion ;-) At least there it&#39;s easier to ignore for those who<br/>\ncame to discuss unschooling their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s going to seem arbitrary and make no sense to some when I suggest that<br/>\nthis isn&#39;t the place for this discussion. It will especially seem arbitrary<br/>\nwhen the list discusses censorship 2 months from now. It will seem to be<br/>\nopinionated for me to say the reason this debate felt so disruptive when a<br/>\nsimilar one won&#39;t raise a stink was not the topic but that there was more<br/>\nemotion and opinion than truth being hurled about. (See Pam&#39;s post about<br/>\nthat.) So be it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s nearly September. Fall and spring are when the most people are looking<br/>\nfor advice on homeschooling. And I&#39;d appreciate your sensitivity in<br/>\nrecognizing that this list exists to meet the needs of the people trying to<br/>\nfind help for their children. If their mailboxes fill up with way too many<br/>\nirrelevant posts -- and, yes, this is going to seem arbitrary because other<br/>\nnoisy box filling discussions will seem equally or more irrelevant to<br/>\nothers! -- they won&#39;t be able to find the answers they&#39;re looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\nUnschooling-dotcom moderator</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":51989482,"authorName":"rsale515@cs.com","from":"rsale515@...","profile":"rsale515","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Discussion on Cultural Anger","postDate":"1030379079","msgId":42057,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExNi4xNjE5MTExMi4yYTliYjA0N0Bjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":42095,"prevInTime":42056,"nextInTime":42058,"topicId":42057,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/26/2002 8:59:34 AM Pacific Daylight Time, ...
