TV really<br/>\nis made for the situation, but there are a couple of other things<br/>\nthat might help.  If you can drag your self outside a bout of<br/>\nrunning around outside makes less vigorous stuff look better to a<br/>\n3. 30 minutes of misery (assuming it makes your eyes hurt and<br/>\nyour bones shiver, which outside does to me when I am sick) for<br/>\nyou may yield a couple of hours of happy quietness.<br/>\n<br/>\n2 activities that tend to go on a loooong time, with little<br/>\nsupervision, are water and rice (separately).  For water -   Put<br/>\na large plastic storage box on some towels on a non carpeted<br/>\nfloor or in a pinch in the bath tub or floor of the shower.  Put<br/>\n6 inches of water in it, then get out plastic measuring cups,<br/>\nladles, funnels, bowls, cups, spray pumps - you name it.  If you<br/>\ndon&#39;t have something like a big plastic box, it should work with<br/>\na deep roasting pan, but make a mental note to invest $5 in a<br/>\nSterlite box soon - it is a great all round toy.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor rice - put a cup or so of uncooked rice (or lentils or peas -<br/>\nsomething small enough not to block an ear or nostril, since you<br/>\naren&#39;t feeling like watching every minute) on a large tray or box<br/>\nbottom - give the kids the same kind of pouring/scooping tots,<br/>\nplus some toilet paper and paper towel rolls and a few things<br/>\nwith easily attached/removed lids. Depending on the kid and the<br/>\ntools available tongs and chopsticks are fun with this too, but<br/>\nmay not be ideal if you have a kid who tends to run with a<br/>\nchopstick in her mouth if your not watching.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the better things about these when you are sick is you<br/>\ndon&#39;t HAVE to clean them up for a long time - leaving them there<br/>\nwhile you nap or until hubby gets home is unlikely to cause<br/>\ndisaster.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sognokids@...\">sognokids@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 24, 2003 12:41 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Oh, HELP!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| I am battling complications from pneumonia.
