He does about one<br/>\na month or so, although he needs  help with a few of each out of each<br/>\nbook.  He is getting a tad tired of the repetition, though, and complains<br/>\nthat many are now too easy for him or too obvious.  I think we will get<br/>\ntwo more books and then cancel our subscription.  He had the smae problem<br/>\nwith the Highlights Top Secret series, but he still likes to do them, even<br/>\nt hough the challenge is in doing the writing, not the thinking.  He<br/>\nreally prefers the magazines about games and puzzless that are sold at<br/>\nnewsstands, although the reading in those is a little too hard.
