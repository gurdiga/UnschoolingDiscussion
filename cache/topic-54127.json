If an Olympic Gold medalist was my <br/>\npriority, not a peaceful, happy relationship, then maybe that would be a good <br/>\napproach.<br/>\nSecondly, when the pushing is actually useful and helpful, it HAS to be <br/>\nbecause the person being pushed wants it.<br/>\nTraining for triathlon means I need some pushing. But I love triathlon, I <br/>\nenjoy the competition and I ask dh to &quot;push&quot; me (in the form of working out <br/>\nwith me, or timing my runs or encouraging me to work out more). We push each <br/>\nother.<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m timing a run for him I ride along on my bike and shout &quot;good job, <br/>\nkeep it going&quot; when his time is right on. If he needs to speed up I tell him. <br/>\nHe does the same for me and our times improve because of this &quot;pushing&quot;.<br/>\nBut if I pushed him when he said &quot;enough&quot;...that would be a bad thing.<br/>\nPushing can work. But it still has to be the desire of the one that is <br/>\nreceiving the pushing, and it has to be up to them when the pushing should <br/>\nstop.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.
