It won&#39;t work at all that way. That&#39;s the <br/>\nwhole idea of where people get the child led term from. My daughter asked <br/>\nfor a math work book last night to do.

As long as she knows she can come back home the second she decides to. <br/>\nYou might be real surprised how things work out.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 helps eliminate e-mail viruses.

My kids have no <br/>\nbedtimes, but I definitely would find a way to make sure they are quiet <br/>\nenough for my dh to sleep. In fact, because our house is not very <br/>\nsoundproof - we all have to work hard to be quiet. For years I sat up <br/>\nwith my younger kids, to keep them quiet so my dh could get to sleep. I <br/>\nturned the tv down, I turned their music down, I shushed them when <br/>\ntheir voices got loud, I distracted them from noisy games, and so on. <br/>\nThey get too tired and sometimes can&#39;t settle down and go to sleep - <br/>\nthey actually got hyperactive when they were overtired. I&#39;d bribe and <br/>\ncajole them to snuggle with me and let me read to them long enough to <br/>\nsettle them down. I&#39;d give them warm milk. I&#39;d put on quiet types of <br/>\nmovies. I&#39;d try to give them separate things to do - so that they <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t rile each other up. I gave them piles of pillows and blankets <br/>\nso that they could settle down right where they were. I put up the pup <br/>\ntent in the living room so they could sleep in it. I put them in warm <br/>\nbaths. I gave them warm milk. We did slow breathing techniques to <br/>\nrelax. We listened to environmental sound tapes and relaxation tapes. <br/>\nWe listened to books and stories on tape - Jim Weiss especially. I gave <br/>\nthem a massage. I laid down in their room with one on each side of me <br/>\nand told them stories about themselves or imaginary stories but using <br/>\ntheir names as the heroines.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  And  the breaking of controllers and other things.. &quot;Pre&quot; <br/>\n&gt; unschooling, those<br/>\n&gt; would have to be &quot;earned&quot; back somehow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At my house they&#39;d probably be put up out of reach somewhere until I <br/>\nwas convinced it wouldn&#39;t happen again. Not as a punishment, per se, <br/>\nbut because we just wouldn&#39;t get something fixed that is going to just <br/>\nbe broken again. Can&#39;t waste money like that.  I&#39;d work on those anger <br/>\nissues in whatever ways I could, of course, as I&#39;m sure you are. The <br/>\ncontrollers and other things would not be the focus - it would be the <br/>\nself-control issues. I like the book by Marilyn (Madilyn?) Shure -- &quot;I <br/>\nCan Problem Solve.&quot; There is one for younger kids and one for older <br/>\nkids. I also like the &quot;How to Talk so Kids will Listen and ....&quot; book. <br/>\nBoth gave me a lot of ideas. I also like, The Explosive Child. Again, <br/>\nthough, i don&#39;t really see this as unschooling issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that lots of people here do see all child-raising issues as <br/>\nunschooling issues and I get their point - but that tends to get <br/>\nconfused with total noncoercive parenting and I just don&#39;t believe that <br/>\nTHAT is necessary for unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;unlimited gaming&quot;   All that stuff I posted earlier about thier<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; frustrations, ect.. and the fact that they can&#39;t work out a sharing <br/>\n&gt; system<br/>\n&gt; between themselves.

Well, thats not unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s my solution too, to having one computer. I know some people just <br/>\nhave the policy in their family that the next person just should wait <br/>\nuntil the first person is done...but that didn&#39;t seem fair to my <br/>\nfamily, so we had a policy, for a long time that when the next person <br/>\nwanted the computer, the previous person would have 1/2 hour more and <br/>\nthen had to turn it over. And so on. We had sign-up sheets, too, for a <br/>\nwhile. We&#39;ve tried different things - now I have my own computer, my <br/>\nhusband has his own, my 18 yo has her own and our 12 and 15 yo&#39;s seem <br/>\nto be able to share almost all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain - I don&#39;t get why that is not unschooling - are you &quot;schooling?&quot; <br/>\nNo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hmm, let me see, I have also had quite a bit of flack from family <br/>\n&gt; about my<br/>\n&gt; choice to unschool.

Sometimes people eventually come <br/>\naround and support it - but often not until the kids get older.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And, my daughter , the &quot;model student&quot;  is feeling very disconcerted <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; uneasy over the lack of structure and lesson plans.

Its been tough for <br/>\n&gt; her to<br/>\n&gt; figure out how to &quot;be herself&quot;  and feel worthy outside of school... <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; written about this before too, and talked about the things I am trying <br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; help her with.   It IS getting better, but she still misses school and <br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; think she would go back in  minute if I suggested it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So - you are forcing her to unschool? Something oxymoronic there -- <br/>\nmaybe she&#39;d like to sign up for online courses or take workshops of <br/>\nsome kind or do a public school isp or a correspondence course or <br/>\nsomething else that is more what she&#39;s comfortable with. It might be <br/>\neasier for her to move from a place of comfort to a more unschooling <br/>\nlife on her own.

But it doesn&#39;t help <br/>\nsomeone unschool if they think of their kids as &quot;special needs&quot; because <br/>\nthat is a label that is meaningless in an unschooling context. <br/>\nUnschoolers think of each of their kids as so completely individual <br/>\nthat it doesn&#39;t make any sense to label them in this context.

I <br/>\nhate to bore others with repeating my concerns, but to be breif.. <br/>\n<br/>\n We have trouble with bedtimes.  My husband needs to be in bed by 10:00 as he <br/>\nhas to get up at 5:00am ( sometimes earlier ) to drive an hour and half to <br/>\nwork.  Since the kids have been homeschooling, and we lifted &quot;bedtime&quot;  they <br/>\nstay up LOUDLY til after midnight.  They wont respect Dh need to sleep.  ( <br/>\njust Ethan and JP, the ???? can&#39;t use a label here.. &quot;busy boys&quot;)  I had some <br/>\nvery good suggestions for this.. but so far, its still a struggle.  <br/>\n<br/>\n And  the breaking of controllers and other things.. &quot;Pre&quot; unschooling, those <br/>\nwould have to be &quot;earned&quot; back somehow.    <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;unlimited gaming&quot;   All that stuff I posted earlier about thier <br/>\nfrustrations, ect.. and the fact that they can&#39;t work out a sharing system <br/>\nbetween themselves.  My previous solution was to allow each one a block of <br/>\ntime and to take turns.. Well, thats not unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHmm, let me see, I have also had quite a bit of flack from family about my <br/>\nchoice to unschool.   Especially from my 16 yo son.  I have written about <br/>\nthis in detail in the past..   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, my daughter , the &quot;model student&quot;  is feeling very disconcerted and <br/>\nuneasy over the lack of structure and lesson plans.  She thrives on <br/>\nassignments, progress, recognigtion, acheivments.   Its been tough for her to <br/>\nfigure out how to &quot;be herself&quot;  and feel worthy outside of school... I&#39;ve <br/>\nwritten about this before too, and talked about the things I am trying to <br/>\nhelp her with.   It IS getting better, but she still misses school and I <br/>\nthink she would go back in  minute if I suggested it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary, I do appreciate your interest in my family.
