Then again, I know my kid,<br/>\nand the only movie that ever bothered her was Gorillas in the Mist, and<br/>\nthat was only because I got Dian Fossey and Jane Goodall mixed up and<br/>\nkept telling her that she was still alive and nothing was going to happen<br/>\nto her... urp. <br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35120,"nextTopicId":35066}}
