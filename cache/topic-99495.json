The kids liked a  lot of it.Hated some of it.<br/>\nI felt  I had to have a few kinds of veggies with every meal. My kids are in their 40,s.<br/>\nWe are raising our great grand daughters. They disliked most vegetables until this last year or so. <br/>\nI used to  make a fuss about that. <br/>\nWe started unschooling-I listened to people talk about not controlling what your kids eat. I slowed down  and thought about it and a ton of other  pre conceived ideas I had. <br/>\nThey love fruit-I love fruit. Fruits in variety have about everything we need that vegetables have.<br/>\n I buy a lot more fruit-I spend  lots of money on fruit. It is always available. <br/>\nThey can have all they want every day-unless of course we have run out and I  we havnt gone to town to shop.<br/>\nWe talk about what is in season-I show them how to pick out the best fruit-we look at what is on sale.-they don&#39;t like salads-they said they don&#39;t eat leaves. fine-I dont like salads  much -we buy canned fruit if thats all that is available .I thought about the veggie thing lately. They love a vegetable soup I finally got really good at making. We drink a lot of canned tomato juice-buy cases of it when it is on for a decent price. Stephanie came home from a friends  last month and  asked if we could buy this kind of corn that wasnt whole pieces ( creamed) -she was tickled pink when I bought a case  of it. (she has forgotten how she hated it a few years ago when  it routinely appeared on the table <br/>\nI make creamed carrots from the garden-they can have it if they like-no one mentions it-usually they choose it.<br/>\nFood-complicated subject sometimes-its getting better...<br/>\ngrace<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99493,"nextTopicId":99484}}
