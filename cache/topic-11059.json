If yes, there are some cheeses that have <br/>\nexcellent protein levels.  Milk has a decent amt of protein, but is still <br/>\nhigher in carbs.  But, if you can drink it, I would, and do, in fact.  Reg. <br/>\nplain yogurt is another good choice.  It is not sweet, but you can sweeten it <br/>\nup by adding some vanilla extract, sweet balance or stevia, and a  dash of <br/>\ncarob-- stir it up, and it is sort of like a chocolate dessert!  My oldest <br/>\nson and I have some every day.  :)    Cottage cheese might be a good idea for <br/>\nyou to try, too.  When you get ready to go to bed at night, make sure to eat <br/>\na snack, like something mentioned above.  This will help keep the bsl <br/>\nregulated, and help to prevent muscle cramps.  Other sources of protein are <br/>\nsoy foods, and soy milks-- some are pretty good; you have to experiment a <br/>\nlittle.  Nuts and p-nut butter are also choices you can try.  There are <br/>\nseveral brands of sugar free nut butters on the market-- some are better than <br/>\nothers.  We are using Smucker&#39;s right now.  Seafood is another good choice, <br/>\nif you like it.  I love grilled shrimp. :)  Adding powdered milk to your <br/>\ncooking will add extra protein to your dishes, too.
