I live in <br/>\nMissouri. I use a daily log that can be found at: <br/>\n<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.anglefire.com/mo3/schoolhouse/dailylog.jpg\">http://www.anglefire.com/mo3/schoolhouse/dailylog.jpg</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\nits very simple to use for me. All MO seems to care about is that <br/>\none, the child/children are in attendence, two, they are being <br/>\n*taught* the 5 required subjects, those 5 must be *taught* in 600 <br/>\nhours per year, 400 of those 600 must be in the home, and additional <br/>\n400 hours must be in non-core subjects per year, total 1000 hours.  I <br/>\nhave 2 children  12 and 10 I keep one daily log per child per week. <br/>\nChildren learn from the time they wake up in the mornings til they go <br/>\nto bed at night. My daily log shows an *hour* in each core subject <br/>\nper day. 1 to 2-1/2 hours per day non-core.  If my son, 12 reads the <br/>\ndirections to a new game cube game, thats reading. If he figures out <br/>\nhow much that game is going to cost to buy/rent, thats math. If he <br/>\nhelps me make cookies and we have to reduce the amounts used, thats <br/>\nfractions. Making cookies is math. Reading the sales adds to me and <br/>\nhelping make a list is reading/writing. Watching the science channel <br/>\ncounts as science. He watched the history channel last night for 3 <br/>\nhours because he wanted to. His favorite subject, The Titanic was <br/>\nbeing shown as they tried to lift a section of it. That counted as <br/>\nscience and social studies. He watched it until 11 p.m. school isn&#39;t <br/>\nout at our home at 3 p.m. its out when they go to bed. Every 2-3 days <br/>\nI write down the hours in the log. I wrote a Plan of Education for <br/>\neach child and have that in a folder I keep the daily log in.  I also <br/>\nkeep a copy of our states law requirements in it. The only thing that <br/>\nwe must show if ever questioned is the daily log, and the only person <br/>\nthat can request that is the Prosecuting attorney.  e-mail me at, <br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Chloe@...\">Chloe@...</a> if you have any questions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;NessaPower&quot; <br/>\n&lt;nessapower@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know I know.....But, would love to hear how one would do a sample <br/>\n </span></blockquote>week for me.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have to record hours, have examples and such(1000 hours by the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>end of the year with 600 of LA, Reading, Math, Sci, and SS). <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is our first year(1st and 4th grader of such), and for the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>past few weeks I have let them basically play and put away all our <br/>\nschoolish books, and it has been soooo less stressful on all of us, <br/>\nespecially my almost 7yr.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; BUT, I&#39;m nervous wreck on having my record information on tact.
