The one thing about unschooling I have <br/>\n&gt; tried <br/>\n&gt; to stress to Darin is that the kids will learn better this way (as opposed <br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; the rigors of a ps curriculum.) but for him not to expect them to pick up a <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; math book or ask for a history book. He says he understands, but I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; think he does..............<br/>\n&gt; I have tried to get him to read books on the subject, then I tried to get <br/>\n&gt; him <br/>\n&gt; to &quot;Just read this chapter honey!&quot; then I tried reading whatever paragraph <br/>\n&gt; had just struck me as an extraordinarily, eye-opening, what ever idea I <br/>\n&gt; thought just might help him *get it*. I&#39;m going to try tapes next. He likes <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; books on tape so maybe this will work! Someone else telling him what I have <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; been saying all along, in their words. I think, over the years, he has come <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; to accept it though. He knows the kids are smart. He is just so impressed <br/>\n&gt; with the way Moly had taken to reading, and is always asking about what she <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; is reading. But I am sure if there were worksheets with big gold stars, all <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; over the fridge, he would be more comfortable. Marrying me has definitely <br/>\n&gt; put <br/>\n&gt; Darin outside his comfort zone! &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My best advice is, be gentle with it.
