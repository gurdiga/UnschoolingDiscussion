One could be charitable and<br/>\nsay they believe that you, as your child&#39;s educator, would want the<br/>\nresults, and since they are not the primary educators, they don&#39;t need<br/>\nthem.  Of course, one could be uncharitable too.  Tests/evaluations are<br/>\nrequired annually until the child reaches 15.  Family Learning<br/>\nOrganization in Spokane (they have a website) sells tests.  Doubt you&#39;d<br/>\nget capital punishment if you didn&#39;t do it, but then again, I haven&#39;t<br/>\nbeen so convicted.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nDAvid<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Congratulations to &#39;Voice-Diary,&#39; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR<br/>\n&gt; life!<br/>\n&gt; -----<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Check it out!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Kelly Thielen","from":"Kelly Thielen &lt;kellylyn@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"zu9BpBYGs20T8-60-bK-P8HWCrprx_lU0KEIK1CYLF69hqFeNW_IRekhM9MK7BGOuuv7TwOjX5ILaCldi6r5-bINR0GmG_w_ht_m","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 50","postDate":"928544531","msgId":478,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy41MS40NzguOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":483,"prevInTime":477,"nextInTime":479,"topicId":478,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
