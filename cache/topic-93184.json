My two boys love it as well,and if it sinks in great if not OK.<br/>\nSecondly <br/>\nOur family loves to play cards games my oldest son Paul just learned <br/>\nto <br/>\nplay a card game called HAND and FOOT. He has learned to count by 5&#39;s <br/>\n10&#39;s and 20&#39;s.<br/>\nLast<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember what post I read that talked about the elderly <br/>\nfeeling like a burden. but It brought back some thoughts form the <br/>\ncloset. When I was growing up my Grandparents were not around. I <br/>\nremember listening to conversation with aunts, uncles about why no <br/>\none wanted them to come and live and the excuces we endless. I also <br/>\nremember the frustration of my mom trying to find a babysitter for me <br/>\nso she could work. It made me feel like i was to much trouble.<br/>\nWhen my oldest son was two we were in a reatarant having dinner <br/>\nand,elderly lady was seated next to us. She asked very loudly to sit <br/>\nsomewhere else because she didn&#39;t want a &quot;figity little kid <br/>\ndisrupting her dinner&quot;. The hostes told her that <br/>\nthere were no other tables. She took the table and after about five <br/>\nminutes of staring at us she asked how old ect. Then told me how much <br/>\ntrouble her two boys were and how she wised there were daycare places <br/>\nback then like there are now. Trying very hard to be nice and polite <br/>\ni asked if her sons visited and the answer was a very angry &quot;No the <br/>\nlast <br/>\ntime I saw them they wanted me to go into a home.&quot; At this point I <br/>\nhad enough, I know I was disrespectful to an edler but enough is <br/>\nenough. <br/>\nMy coment was &quot;Thats the problem with this world we look for others <br/>\nto <br/>\nraise our children and care for the elderly&quot;. <br/>\nNow when my son asks me why we call and visit grandma so much I tell <br/>\nhim that&#39;s what we do for family we help out, his answer is alway OK <br/>\ncan I help. My feeling is that the cycle has to stop somewhere why <br/>\nnot here.<br/>\nI&#39;m very sorry for being so long winded but had to get this of my <br/>\nchest be for the little one wakes up thanks for listening<br/>\nElizabeth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93182,"nextTopicId":93145}}
