We put that we are and inclusive group and<br/>\nwelcome people from all different backgrounds and teaching styles.  I also<br/>\nput our group on all the web pages I could find for our state.  I have<br/>\ngotten about 10 responses from the web.  We are growing slowly but the<br/>\npeople in our group are wonderful.  Also, we decided on a monthly mom&#39;s<br/>\nnight out, that way we had a meeting time for new people to come and meet<br/>\nus.  We do a weekly play day too but there&#39;s not much time to talk there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway HTH.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1262,"nextTopicId":1263}}
