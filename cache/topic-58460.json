My son is <br/>\npretty good about saving up for things that he wants. If he wants <br/>\nsomething bigger, we have a discussion about whether or not we can <br/>\nchip in more money towards the bigger item (depending on how much we <br/>\nhave at the time). Since DH owns his own business, and the amount of <br/>\nmoney we get in each month is variable (sometimes by a little, <br/>\nsometimes by a lot - the weeks after 9/11 when general aviation shut <br/>\ndown, for instance, we had *no* income because we depend on <br/>\naviation). So the answer to any question about whether something can <br/>\nbe bought, or whether we can go on a trip, or whatever may be <br/>\ndifferent at different times. We&#39;ve tried to explain this to the kids <br/>\nand also go over our household expenses so that they know what our <br/>\nmoney goes toward.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has also been really great about thinking up ways he can earn <br/>\nhis own money. Last year he grew plants from seeds and from cuttings <br/>\nand propagation from our garden. Then a few times during the summer, <br/>\nhe went to a friend&#39;s garage sale and set up his own plant sale. He <br/>\nmade his own signs, and hawked his wares like a trooper, going out <br/>\ninto the groups of people and saying things like &quot;You look like you <br/>\ncould use a plant!&quot; or &quot;Did you know if you buy one of my perennials, <br/>\nyou&#39;ll have flowers every year!&quot; Who could resist? I think his total <br/>\nfor the summer was $48, not bad for a (then) 5 year old. This year he <br/>\nhas bigger plans. He wants to sell some of the compost worms, and he <br/>\nwants to start more plants from seeds. I told him I&#39;d front him the <br/>\nmoney for seeds and help him keep the books so he can see how much he <br/>\nmakes in profit, and how much his expenses were. Last year he kept <br/>\ntrack of which plants sold more than others, and as he did subsequent <br/>\nsales, he concentrated more on growing the better-selling plants. I <br/>\nhave to admit, I&#39;m pretty impressed with his natural business acumen!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne book that a friend let me borrow was &quot;Rich Kid, Smart Kid&quot; by <br/>\nRobert Kiyosaki. While it&#39;s not an unschooling book, there&#39;s some <br/>\ngood info in there in helping kids learn about money in real life <br/>\nways that will benefit them in the future. I like Rich Dad&#39;s approach <br/>\nto many things (though it&#39;s definitely a &quot;take what works&quot; type of <br/>\nbook. The author spends a whole lot of time telling us what&#39;s wrong <br/>\nwith the way schools teach kids, and how therefore it&#39;s up to us to <br/>\nhelp them outside of school. It always amazes me that even very smart <br/>\npeople don&#39;t see that the school component of that equation is simply <br/>\nunnecessary! But I digress... he&#39;s very big on kids learning in real <br/>\nlife ways, and that helped me think about ways in which I could help <br/>\nmy kids pursue their own ventures.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] What about money?","postDate":"1044979366","msgId":58479,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWEwMWMyZDFlNyQ1Yzc0YmM0MCQ2NTAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PEYxMzUxTEZiTFRyaTNWa2Qxa1YwMDAwYTcwN0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":58475,"nextInTopic":58480,"prevInTime":58478,"nextInTime":58480,"topicId":58460,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... restrictions on them Sigh, I wish I d known more of these ideas before the kids were born.

So <br/>\nwe changed. <br/>\n<br/>\n What works for us now is that we sit down as a family and do the bills.  <br/>\nSometimes the boys are interested in this part and sometimes not and they get <br/>\nto use the calculator.  We then talk about other bills that we need to set <br/>\nmoney aside for and vacations that we already have in the mix.  We figure out <br/>\nabout how much money we will need and how much we can put into savings for <br/>\nthat (like the live and learn conference).  Then when all is said and done we <br/>\ntalk about things we want to do and buy.  Like a trip to the zoo or another <br/>\ngaming piece that Dallen wants or a computer game Phillip wants, also house <br/>\nthings like building a deck etc. Figure out about how much money we have for <br/>\nthese things and if it will be doable to get the computer game this pay day <br/>\nor wait until next.  Or set aside a little money for the deck but not start <br/>\nit this month.  It has worked great for us and I think the boys understand <br/>\nbetter about budget and they buy things they really want and have put some <br/>\nthought into.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] What about money?","postDate":"1044965413","msgId":58470,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNkU1MjU1LjEzQzY2JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNWQwMWMyZDE4NSRkY2Y1MTUyMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":58465,"nextInTopic":58475,"prevInTime":58469,"nextInTime":58471,"topicId":58460,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I <br/>\nreally don&#39;t have a problem with them asking for things we can&#39;t afford. <br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s because of all the years of us having no restrictions on them, <br/>\nthem having their own money to buy what they want with it. We talk about <br/>\nmoney and what it takes to run a household. Not to the point where they need <br/>\nto worry, but enough where they understand what it takes and where money <br/>\ngoes. Some kids just don&#39;t get that you have to pay to live in a house and <br/>\nhave lights and all!!! Maybe because of all this, they don&#39;t ask for things <br/>\nnot possible for us. And I do believe the way they were brought up makes a <br/>\ndifference too. As much as I have thought that what they asked for in the <br/>\npast would not be as great as they thought, we would get it anyway. Then <br/>\nthey would find out for themselves about good choices. After one or two <br/>\ndisappointing choices, they would think more about it next time. And that <br/>\ngoes with my 17 year old too.
