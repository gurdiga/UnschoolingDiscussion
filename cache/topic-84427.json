And when that <br/>\navailability is long-term casual, candy loses value and loses glory.  If <br/>\ncandy is occasional and special and forbidden and valuable-reward at the same <br/>\ntime, and shamed bad-habit all at once, it become more than it&#39;s worth.   When <br/>\nit&#39;s just there, getting dusty or moldy (depending on climate) it&#39;s not much more <br/>\nvaluable than paper napkins or table knives.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually it wouldn&#39;t be worth kids spending allowance on.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI had some homemade bread last week and offered to make Holly French toast <br/>\none morning when she said she wanted something different to eat for breakfast.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t really love French toast, but we had extra eggs and this bread was <br/>\nperfect for it, but Holly said, &quot;No thanks, I&#39;m not in the mood for something <br/>\nsweet.&quot;   We did cream cheese on toast instead.

It isn&#39;t an either/or scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughters, bless them, do not care for my delicious (if I say so myself)<br/>\nhomemade hamburgers. They politely decline them when I make them. They do<br/>\nenjoy a nice McDonald&#39;s burger. It&#39;s their choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is a fact of life in our family right now, though: tight budget.<br/>\n&gt; Living in the boonies. Natural/whole foods/Granola for a mom. If the<br/>\n&gt; kids wanted to supply a bottomless candy bowl...go for it. It&#39;s their<br/>\n&gt; house, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Any and all of those &quot;facts of life&quot; can be changed, or solved, or bypassed,<br/>\nor worked around and with, to give your children real choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nA tight budget means cutting back somewhere else, or finding a way to make<br/>\nsome extra money, or finding cheap candy sources.<br/>\n<br/>\nNatural/whole foods/Granola is your thing, not necessarily theirs.<br/>\nRespecting other people is all about the differences, not about applauding<br/>\nwhere others are like us and ignoring their wants and needs where they are<br/>\nnot.<br/>\n<br/>\nA life in the boonies is a non-issue -- many candies keep a long time. Ditto<br/>\nmany healthy snacks, including dried fruit (and drying fruit at home is fun,<br/>\ntoo).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the kids have no money are you willing and able to help them figure out<br/>\nways to get money so they can meet their own wants and needs, if you are<br/>\nunable or unwilling to do so?<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84561,"nextTopicId":84562}}
