Again it depends on what you mean.  I would vote, protest etc. against something which I felt morally reprehensible.  However, I don&#39;t need anyone else in the world to see it my way.  (Psst, just between you and me, most of the world sees it differently than I do. Even most Orthodox Jewish, homeschooling feminists!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway,  I am feeling rather numb I guess.  I just came back from the funeral of a 27 man.  Who did a lot of living in his short time on earth.... It was very upsetting....<br/>\n<br/>\nbe well,<br/>\nRachel Ann<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49293,"nextTopicId":49364}}
