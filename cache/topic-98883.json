From HF to G-burg it is about an hour <br/>\nor so drive, count it as two hours door to door.<br/>\nYou also mentioned going to Anteitam Battlefield, I would spend a half day at <br/>\nHF then head to the battlefield in the afternoon. The field is located in a <br/>\ntown called Sharpsburg and they have a FANTASTIC old fashioned Ice Cream shop <br/>\nthere. Perfect for lunch. LOL<br/>\nThen I&#39;d head up to Gettysburg and get settled for the evening. Gettysburg is <br/>\nan entire day visit (at least) and starting there in the morning will help. I <br/>\nwould love to do those two days with you, do you have an idea of when you <br/>\nwill be here?<br/>\n<br/>\nElissa Jill<br/>\n<br/>\nLife&#39;s challenges are not supposed to paralyze you;<br/>\nThey&#39;re supposed to help you discover who you are. <br/>\n~Bernice Johnson Reagon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98882,"nextTopicId":98884}}
