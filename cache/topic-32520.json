He does not listen well to no pointing or stop shooting people. <br/>\nIt is a constant battle. I thought when he was little I would be able to <br/>\nsteer him from gunplay. I have since learned I can not. I am intolerant to <br/>\npeople hurting people, animals, wildlife, and I have a son who is fascinated <br/>\nwith pointing and shooting. I continually remind him people will not like to <br/>\nbe pointed at. He holds his hand up and shoots at cars on drives sometimes. <br/>\nTalk about worry. I have talked with him about hunting and using the animal <br/>\nhe has hunted. We now let him experience his shooting power with friends or <br/>\nfamily members who are willing to play his game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have started showing him the history of guns and weapons. We look at <br/>\nprevious wars and civilizations to see what guns looked like, who they hurt. <br/>\nWhen he is older, I will show him photos of gun wounds. A picture speaks way <br/>\nmore than my nagging. I can say I have learned to tune down my reaction to <br/>\nhis play. I have also found acceptable shooting actions. When he is fixated <br/>\nwith shooting, I usually join in and try to suggest ideas like shooting <br/>\nwater to put out a raging fire, or shooting beautiful pictures with a <br/>\ncamera. We have a little digital hand camera which has been used a lot on <br/>\nthese shooting frenzies of his. A real tool, which makes a great noise and <br/>\nproduces cool movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have relaxed our attitude, tried to find acceptable substitutes and <br/>\ncontinually remind him of the power of real live guns and the damage they <br/>\ninflict when used.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout any true answers to this complex issue,<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\">http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32519,"nextTopicId":32521}}
