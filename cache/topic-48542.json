Before we settled on her <br/>\ndoing it that way, I talked to driver ed schools. One had an interesting <br/>\nway of doing it - they had class every weeknight - you had to go to a <br/>\ncertain number of hours of class, but they didn&#39;t care which ones. They <br/>\noffered &quot;lesson 1&quot; on Mondays, &quot;Lesson 2&quot; on Tuesdays, etc. So - I asked <br/>\nthem, &quot;What if they only come on Mondays, won&#39;t they only get Lesson 1 over <br/>\nand over?&quot; Answer: &quot;Well, yes, that&#39;s true, but the law doesn&#39;t say that <br/>\nthey have to actually attend all the different lessons, just that this <br/>\nmaterial has to be offered and they have to attend a certain number of hours.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\nwww.NHEN.org<br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48294,"nextTopicId":48549}}
