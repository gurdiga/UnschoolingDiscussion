We are all trying to keep the number<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unwanted animals down so this has to be enforced or well, one cat has<br/>\n3-8<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kittens and 6 months later there are say 3 more cats pregnant from that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; litter and so on...also, this is state mandated as well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Shots are also a requirement for the health of an animal but truthfully,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the shelters are too busy to check into it and see.  They would spend<br/>\n&gt; 99.9%<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of their time on the phone to different vets trying to do this and some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people do them on their own...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The implant is for YOUR protection, not to track the animal in the<br/>\nmanner<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in which I think you mean.  If the dog/cat ever got away from you, there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would be a way to get it back to you.  We honestly wish more people had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them when we find their animals...I have seen many kids in tears when<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; family pet disappeared or took a dog on vacation and it happened to<br/>\nbreak<br/>\n&gt; &gt; off its leash or slipped its collar and was gone in a flash.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Most of what they do on applications/contracts is to make people realize<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the importance that their pet carries.  They are trying to make people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; responsible for their pets so that our jobs are easier in rescue.  If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people got their animals spayed and neutered, there would be no real<br/>\nneed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for rescue groups anymore.  Some countries do not have them as they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; regulate animal husbandry so much.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Our contracts have the same thing on it about taking the dogs back if<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spay/neutered on time and if that and the shots are not done, you could<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fined $150 dollars...it is a protection to the animals who have already<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been through a lot in their life.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; At 10:39 PM 12/13/01 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I tried to do that once when dd wanted a kitten.

We are all trying to keep the<br/>\nnumber<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unwanted animals down so this has to be enforced or well, one cat has<br/>\n&gt; 3-8<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kittens and 6 months later there are say 3 more cats pregnant from<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; litter and so on...also, this is state mandated as well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shots are also a requirement for the health of an animal but<br/>\ntruthfully,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the shelters are too busy to check into it and see.  They would spend<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 99.9%<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of their time on the phone to different vets trying to do this and<br/>\nsome<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people do them on their own...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The implant is for YOUR protection, not to track the animal in the<br/>\n&gt; manner<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in which I think you mean.  If the dog/cat ever got away from you,<br/>\nthere<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be a way to get it back to you.  We honestly wish more people<br/>\nhad<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them when we find their animals...I have seen many kids in tears when<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; family pet disappeared or took a dog on vacation and it happened to<br/>\n&gt; break<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; off its leash or slipped its collar and was gone in a flash.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most of what they do on applications/contracts is to make people<br/>\nrealize<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the importance that their pet carries.  They are trying to make people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; responsible for their pets so that our jobs are easier in rescue.  If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people got their animals spayed and neutered, there would be no real<br/>\n&gt; need<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for rescue groups anymore.  Some countries do not have them as they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; regulate animal husbandry so much.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Our contracts have the same thing on it about taking the dogs back if<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spay/neutered on time and if that and the shots are not done, you<br/>\ncould<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fined $150 dollars...it is a protection to the animals who have<br/>\nalready<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been through a lot in their life.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At 10:39 PM 12/13/01 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I tried to do that once when dd wanted a kitten.
