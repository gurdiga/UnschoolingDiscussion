(well, i always took care of that with a january birthday..went from xmas to birthday season for me).. <br/>\n<br/>\nand as to different celebrations in different religions.. <br/>\none thing is that most religions have holidays at similar times of year.. they ALL go back to natural phenomenon.. solstice, equinox, new growing season, harvest time.. etc etc.....this is the way i like to celebrate holidays.. for their underlying beginnings as well as overlayed religious meanings.. <br/>\n<br/>\nL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: gruvystarchild <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, August 06, 2002 9:59 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Twelfth Night/Mardi Gras<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ,&quot;.. would have to bring the next cake.. it&#39;s a whole strange new <br/>\n  orleans thing.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n  No, actually it&#39;s a whole Southern thing. Mardi Gras actually has <br/>\n  it&#39;s roots in Mobile (about 45 minutes from where I live) but New <br/>\n  Orleans gets all the focus and people think it started there because <br/>\n  it gets so insanely crazy over this holiday now.<br/>\n  Here in Pensacola, you will find King&#39;s cake in every store come <br/>\n  February, the typical purple, gold and green beads on people and <br/>\n  yards get decorated right after the Christmas decor comes down.<br/>\n  I love Mardi Gras here, we don&#39;t get the crazines of New Orleans, but <br/>\n  it is a big deal. Many parades and events to attend come February. <br/>\n  The kids love getting their moonpies (never knew what those were <br/>\n  before moving here) and beads.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you have questions, concerns or problems with this list, please email the Moderator, Joyce Fetteroll, at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
