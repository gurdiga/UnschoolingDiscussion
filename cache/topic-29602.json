My Daughter is almost 8 and very bored.  We have been doing<br/>\nworkbooks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and she reads A LOT but only likes Babysitter Club books mostly.  She is<br/>\nan<br/>\n&gt; &gt; EXCELLENT reader.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How about reading *to* her. Listen to books on tape. Watch movies that<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; been made from books.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And then don&#39;t worry about what she reads. When you think about it, how<br/>\n&gt; would you feel if you read romance novels for relaxation and your husband<br/>\n&gt; looked at it with disapproval because he felt you should be reading more<br/>\n&gt; important books?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is she drawn to books and TV shows and movies about people (as opposed to<br/>\n&gt; animals or fantasy)? She probably has a high interpersonal intelligence.<br/>\nAnd<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;ll learn best by helping her explore people. There have been lots of<br/>\n&gt; good book series recommended. Try some out to see if she&#39;s interested. She<br/>\n&gt; may not want to read them herself, but she might enjoy having them read to<br/>\n&gt; her. By learning about the people of the past then she&#39;ll absorb history<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;ll be interested in the factoids of history to flesh out the times her<br/>\n&gt; favorite characters lived in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, she doesn&#39;t know many Geography, History, etc facts.  How does she<br/>\nlearn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; these if she has no interest?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By living life. By *needing* the information for *herself*.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By making sure she has *access* to fun ways to learn them. And, very<br/>\n&gt; importantly, by *not* seeing those as necessary for her to learn geography<br/>\n&gt; and history. She should encounter these things in a multitude of ways,<br/>\n&gt; primarily in context. A chapter on the geography and history of Japan and<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s imports and exports is just facts that look impressive if quizzed on.<br/>\n&gt; But if she hasn&#39;t found a reason to know about Japan, the information is<br/>\n&gt; just taking up valuable brain space. *But* if she gets intrigued by<br/>\nPokemon,<br/>\n&gt; and sees the Pokemon names written in Japanese and gets intrigued by the<br/>\n&gt; cultural references and listens to folk tales from Japan then where Japan<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; on the map and the Shogun/Emperor rulership of Japan become more<br/>\ninteresting<br/>\n&gt; and useful bits of information.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Strew her path with reasons for knowing about these things. She doesn&#39;t<br/>\nneed<br/>\n&gt; to pick up all that you strew. It just needs to be there so she has access<br/>\n&gt; to new interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Or the multipication tables?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I still have gaps in my multiplication tables and I managed to get through<br/>\n&gt; engineering school ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Because of the way schools teach math and the schools&#39; need to have<br/>\n&gt; documentation that the kids are progressing, schools need to teach in<br/>\n*very*<br/>\n&gt; different ways than kids naturally learn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The most important thing you can help you daughter get is an understanding<br/>\n&gt; of how numbers work. And the way she can get that is by *using* math as a<br/>\n&gt; tool. Games. (If she needs help, help her. You don&#39;t want her to avoid an<br/>\n&gt; opportunity to use math because she wants to avoid being quizzed on<br/>\n&gt; arithmetic!) Allowance (and figuring out how much longer until she can<br/>\n&gt; afford something.) Avoid pencil and paper math for now. It is *very*<br/>\n&gt; abstract. Do it in your heads,that way you&#39;re forced to tear the problems<br/>\n&gt; apart to make them as simple as possible. And by tearing the numbers apart<br/>\n&gt; and putting them together in new ways she&#39;ll learn how numbers work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But *don&#39;t* see these as lessons she must do in order to learn. They&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; *opportunities* for her *if* she finds the question intriguing. Lots of<br/>\ntime<br/>\n&gt; she won&#39;t. That&#39;s okay. There&#39;s a whole world of other opportunities that<br/>\n&gt; *will* tie into what she&#39;s drawn in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Specific things to do would be wonderful, I have NO imagination at all<br/>\non what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to do besides book work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps what might help the most is *you* getting interested in things.<br/>\nTake<br/>\n&gt; some time to explore hobbies and things that interest you. (Yes, easier<br/>\nsaid<br/>\n&gt; than done with 5 kids! But if you&#39;re modeling that life is all about<br/>\n&gt; maintenance rather than joyful living, then that&#39;s the lesson they&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; learn!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stop and wonder about things. Rather than seeing a web in the corner and<br/>\n&gt; wondering where the broom is, wonder why the spider built it at that<br/>\n&gt; particular location. And what do they eat in the winter? Watch a pot begin<br/>\n&gt; to boil and notice what really happens. Call any kids who want to watch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Get some videos about something that you&#39;ve always wanted to know about<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; watch them *for yourself*. Find out something new just for the heck of it.<br/>\n&gt; Let it lead to something else new. If we aren&#39;t learning for the sake of<br/>\n&gt; learning, then is it fair to expect our kids to?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joyce<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
