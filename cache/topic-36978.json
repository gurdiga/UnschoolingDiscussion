Books are a lot of this, because they<br/>\n&gt; are something I&#39;ve always bought a lot of so whenever I find a good<br/>\n&gt; source of used kids books I pick some up.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I give a toy or two of the non-educational variety for these -- the kind of<br/>\nstuff kids like but really are not vastly educational in and of themselves,<br/>\nand I&#39;m not likely to spend money on during the year.  Also, we are building<br/>\na tool set for our son, so he always gets a tool for these occasions and<br/>\nlooks forward to that (screwdriver, hammer, wrench, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this isn&#39;t what you&#39;re asking, but have you considered making those<br/>\nkind of occasions more about the non-gift stuff and just doing the holiday<br/>\nstuff together - pagents, church, decorating, baking, etc.  Birthdays might<br/>\nbe harder with that, but surely somebody will have some good ideas!<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36889,"nextTopicId":36979}}
