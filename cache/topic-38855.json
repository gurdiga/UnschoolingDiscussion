And if we<br/>\nchoose to not do it, that&#39;s fine too.   It sounds like she<br/>\ncooks when she is inspired to do so, but maybe that isn&#39;t<br/>\nthat often :-)&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that she doesn&#39;t cook because she doesn&#39;t enjoy it. She was never <br/>\nallowed in the kitchen and is almost afraid of it. When we were young she was <br/>\nfascinated about how cooking &quot;happened&quot;, but still wasn&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; as a <br/>\nchild/teen. As an adult, I don&#39;t know why she hasn&#39;t learned (I&#39;ll ask this <br/>\nThursday! &lt;g&gt;). Maybe she likes to eat out every meal.
