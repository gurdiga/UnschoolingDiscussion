But <br/>\nthen after a while, the relationship stablizes again, settling down into <br/>\na slightly different place. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking a lot about this lately...the growing up, and distancing.  First let me say that I was not always unschooling my son.  I haven&#39;t been following this thread, but we didn&#39;t start seriously unschooling until about 2 years ago, and it wasn&#39;t until the past 18 months or so that I really let go.  My son has taken the brunt of a lot of my mistakes, some of which were quite harsh.  So, let me just put out there that &quot;there is hope&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs i let go, our relationship righted itself, and came back into balance, and its been a beautiful thing that I will FOREVER cherish, especially now that he is growing up and moving toward living his own life.  I can&#39;t tell you how glad I am that I backed off...and how sorry I feel for my friends who think they still must fight with their kids to get things done.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son (almost 16 years old) is the one who has moved away from me the most.  Not in a violent way, just in a natural way.  I hadn&#39;t expected it so soon!  I really really miss him.  I suppose empty nest is just starting to settle in.  He doesn&#39;t need me in the same tangible way he used to.  It hurts a little bit.  We mostly now just enjoy each other&#39;s company.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only real difference between him now at 16 and when he is 20 is that he doesn&#39;t have a job, and isn&#39;t driving.  Other than those two practical matters, he is all but living his own life under our roof...with us there all the time for &quot;back up&quot; and support. I would feel completely comfortable leaving him at home alone for the weekend.  We did almost that this past weekend and it was fine.  He even cleaned up a bit around the house, took care of the animals, and WASHED THE DISHES!!!! WOW!<br/>\n<br/>\nI just cannot believe it.  Its like this man sprouted out of nowhere, and kidnapped my son!! LOL.  I cannot believe how fast it all happened!  He&#39;s a great guy.  Still has a few quirks that are annoying, but then we all do I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I just wanted to share that relationships can be re-balanced, and that its so important to do it, because its really all you&#39;ll have left when they are grown.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] natural changes in older kids?","postDate":"1089334442","msgId":96127,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhNC4yNWZmOGMxMS4yZTFmNDZhYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":96126,"nextInTopic":96152,"prevInTime":96126,"nextInTime":96128,"topicId":96110,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/8/04 3:09:08 PM, mjcmbrwn@ihug.co.nz writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-758642263\">In a message dated 7/8/04 3:09:08 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mjcmbrwn@...\">mjcmbrwn@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; The LLL image is the one I like to use - though it is hard to think like <br/>\nthat sometimes when you are looking up at your 6&#39;3&quot; son who is being <br/>\nantsy!

I was talking to Marty about it yesterday and said Kirby was <br/>\n&gt;acting like most people&#39;s kids start acting when they&#39;re twelve (in way of <br/>\n&gt;backhandedly admitting I&#39;m pretty lucky that it took this long for him to feel <br/>\n&gt;crowded), and I wish I remembered exactly what Marty said, but it was something <br/>\n&gt;like &quot;Maybe we just takes us longer to grow into our big-shoes.&quot;  (emphasis on <br/>\n&gt;the Big, if big was the word he used.  Some  shoes)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My next son is nearly 21, and it was much much later, very subtle, still <br/>\non going in a very subtle way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 17yo has just started, about 6 months ago and is a bit more antsy <br/>\nwith it, but it&#39;s liveable with almost all of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that there are many variables:  how your relationship is to <br/>\nstart with, the kid&#39;s personality, your own personality, etc etc.  But <br/>\nif our kids are to become truely independent, they have to put distance <br/>\nbetween themselves and us.  If your relationship is good, respectful, <br/>\nfearless, as yours seems to be, and you have unschooled in the full <br/>\nsense of the word - the way you use it - then it will be a subtle <br/>\ndistancing. It is still sad for us mothers, but seems necessary.  But <br/>\nthen after a while, the relationship stablizes again, settling down into <br/>\na slightly different place.  If you have screwed up the way I did with <br/>\nmy eldest, then it is a much more violent and distressing thing - but <br/>\nstill not without hope.  He is married, and has two children now, only 2 <br/>\n1/2 and 8 months, but both getting married and having kids has changed <br/>\nhis perspective a lot - he&#39;s more sympathetic to the feelings he now <br/>\nunderstands that I had, and of course, I have traveled a long way in my <br/>\nhead, and behaviour, since those bad days.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think it&#39;s instinctive on both our parts. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I really believe it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If he felt safer at home than <br/>\n&gt;out, he wouldn&#39;t go.  We&#39;re not in a hurry for him to go.  He&#39;s not in a hurry <br/>\n&gt;to go, either.  But I feel the thoughts and feelings as I felt strong new <br/>\n&gt;feelings and urges and &quot;knowings&quot; when I had babies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s like the baby led weaning we talked about at La Leche League.  It <br/>\nnever ceases to amaze me how LLL ideas remain so pertinent to my life <br/>\neven now my kids are 23, 21, 17, & 14.  Just as our children gradually <br/>\nweaned from the breast, and then from needing our physical presence all <br/>\nthe time - as long as they knew they had us to return to whenever they <br/>\nwanted, so our young adults are lucky if they have a home, parents, that <br/>\nthey can feel comfortable in using as a safe base that will always be <br/>\nthere for them, enabling them to venture forth into the world futher and <br/>\nfurther.  Those who are pushed away, made to &#39;stand on their own two <br/>\nfeet&#39;, be real men, blah blah, will be less able to actually be <br/>\nindependent in their Being.  They will rebel violently or become passive <br/>\nblobs.  They will be needy adults - like me - rather than really <br/>\nindependent.  They may be loud, brash, rebellous, agressive even, but <br/>\nthat is not real independence.  I feel sad for me, sad for my eldest son <br/>\n- but we are all doing better now.  But I also really do think it is <br/>\npartly a personality thing too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe LLL image is the one I like to use - though it is hard to think like <br/>\nthat sometimes when you are looking up at your 6&#39;3&quot; son who is being <br/>\nantsy!

Is it possible it&#39;s<br/>\ninstinct, from the days when kids this age are soon to<br/>\nbe parents, and have families and homes of their own?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOn TV commercials and print ads, they often show older kids playing with a <br/>\ngame or toy than the actual target audience.  Part of the sell in such cases is <br/>\nthe identification with the older kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know how snakes swallow?  How people swallow?  How that motion starts and <br/>\nthen just perpetuates itself until the wad is through?<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t go to kindergarten, but I&#39;ve had relatives go (and my brother, when <br/>\nhe was in my care at that age) and the background song was &quot;When you get to <br/>\nreal school...&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember from first grade, the explanations of the big pencils and fat <br/>\ncrayons.    They were so when we got to second grade and couldn&#39;t us those <br/>\nanymore, we would be ready.  The dotted lines in our practice paper wouldn&#39;t be there <br/>\nanymore when we got to second grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn sixth grade they started in on us about Jr. High, and how much different <br/>\nit would be, and we needed to look at that, and want it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes that&#39;s a threat, and sometimes it&#39;s a happy goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But when you get to *high* school...&quot;<br/>\n&quot;In college, they won&#39;t baby you the way we do in high school...&quot;<br/>\n&quot;This level of writing wouldn&#39;t cut it in grad school, but it&#39;s okay for a <br/>\nJr. English paper...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo people aren&#39;t living in the moment or appreciating being where they are <br/>\n(except on South Park, where they decided to stay in 2nd grade, right? or <br/>\nthird?&lt;g&gt;).  They&#39;re looking at the older kids and wondering what all they have to <br/>\ndo to be them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen very little of that with unschooled kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is an instinct, I&#39;m sure, on the part of child and parent, but I think <br/>\nthere&#39;s a cultural swallowing that happens.  It has the movement and pressure <br/>\nand the kids are gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96149,"nextTopicId":5534}}
