PLEASE all South Carolinians, <br/>\ncontact me off-list---my email addy, my snailmail addy and my phone number <br/>\nfollow. I&#39;d be happy you talk to you at length about unschooling and the law <br/>\nin SC.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is NOT illegal to homeschool in SC.<br/>\nDSS will NOT take your children away unless they are believed to be in <br/>\nimminent danger.<br/>\nHomeschooling is NOT imminent danger. &lt;Give me a break!&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe father of my son&#39;s best friend is the spokesman for DSS (and one hell of <br/>\na nice guy). He says that as long as you&#39;re following the law, DSS will not <br/>\nbother you. DSS has much bigger fish to fry!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou do NOT need to keep your son in school another day---another <br/>\nhour---another MINUTE. Keep him home tomorrow! Tell them he&#39;s visiting a sick <br/>\ngrandmother. He&#39;s vomiting up blood. He&#39;s out of the country! He&#39;s sick (and <br/>\ntired of school)! HE WON&#39;T BE BACK TO THAT DAMNED SCHOOL EVER AGAIN!<br/>\n<br/>\nGo online and register with an accountability associaltion and you won&#39;t have <br/>\nto worry another second!<br/>\n<br/>\nDo NOT say you&#39;re UNschooling. Nobody knows what that is. Just say you&#39;re <br/>\nhomeschooling your child. Keep everything to a minimum---only tell them <br/>\nwhat&#39;s necessary---and that is that you&#39;ve registered with an association. <br/>\n(You must have a high school diploma or equivalent, &quot;teach&quot; 180 days/year, <br/>\nkeep a dailyrecord/portfolio/journal, and cover the following subjects: <br/>\nreading, writing, &#39;rithmatic, social studies, and science. In high school, <br/>\nadd literature and composition. And you must be registered with an <br/>\naccountability association. We recommend PACESC  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pacesc.com/&quot;\">http://www.pacesc.com/&quot;</a>&gt;Click here: pacesc.com&lt;/A&gt;    <br/>\n---the most non-invasive of all we&#39;ve researched). <br/>\n<br/>\nVirginia, you are barking up the wrong tree. You seem to be going with option <br/>\n#1. You NEED to be going with option #3---the ONLY option for UNschoolers. <br/>\nYou NEED to read the law, which is posted at the SOS site, at the PACESC <br/>\nsite---and at any homeschool site in the state.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease call me. And you REALLY should come to the conference. We DO have an <br/>\nSOS member in Goose Creek (only in SC, y&#39;all! &lt;G&gt;). Jump on the SOS site and <br/>\nfind her---and one or two others in Charleston. Columbia is not the upstate &lt;<br/>\nG&gt;, it&#39;s the midlands-- Now, I just cut your trip in half!!! And I&#39;m sure <br/>\nshe&#39;ll give you a ride!<br/>\n<br/>\nI will NOT be home tomorrow---I&#39;m at Spiderwoman&#39;s trying to get the handbook <br/>\nready to go to print, but I&#39;ll home tomorrow evening, and I&#39;d love to talk <br/>\nwith you!<br/>\n<br/>\nCALL ME!<br/>\nAnd I apologize to non-South Carolinians---but just in case there&#39;s another <br/>\nlurking or who later reads the archives...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy, Coordinator<br/>\nSchools Out Support<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:coordinator@...\">coordinator@...</a><br/>\n803-776-4849<br/>\nFax: 803-776-7006<br/>\n118 Steeplechase South<br/>\nColimbia, SC 29209-4810<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org\">http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44178,"nextTopicId":44308}}
