It&#39;s one of those missing<br/>\npuzzle pieces that I mentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was arguing an entirely different point. It was more along the lines of<br/>\nshe was saying &quot;Breastfeeding is how babies naturally need to eat&quot; and<br/>\nothers were saying &quot;Yes, but what about a cleft palate child who needs a<br/>\nbottle.&quot; (I&#39;m making that up since I can&#39;t think of something off the top of<br/>\nmy head that would prevent a child from breastfeeding.) The second doesn&#39;t<br/>\nalter the truth of the first. If her argument had been that all babies need<br/>\nto breastfeed, then the second *would* be a counterargument. But the second<br/>\n*isn&#39;t* a counterargument against what is natural for babies. Does that make<br/>\nsense?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s frustrating for those participating since there were (and not for the<br/>\nfirst time) two separate arguments going on at the same time and each was<br/>\nassuming the other was arguing about the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether you dislike her style or whether you wanted her to argue something<br/>\ndifferent than she was arguing or whatever, she is who she is and is<br/>\nentitled to that and doesn&#39;t need to change to be more like what others need<br/>\nfrom someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, if someone says she has a certain amount of experience that is<br/>\nmerely a statement of fact. If others interpret that to mean &quot;I&#39;m an expert&quot;<br/>\nor assume it&#39;s inteded as a challenge or something to shame them into<br/>\nsilence then who is at fault, the one speaking facts or the one<br/>\ninterpretting them?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone speaks strongly on things she cares deeply about, if others find<br/>\nit difficult to argue with her (whether because of facts or writing style or<br/>\nthinking style) does that automatically confer expert status on her?<br/>\n<br/>\nSince Sandra doesn&#39;t call herself an expert calling her a<br/>\nquote-resident-expert-unquote (implying the so-called title is questionable<br/>\nwhen *she* isn&#39;t doing the calling) would be a personal attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She finally understood that<br/>\n&gt; she was not on solid ground with her arguments, and was looking worse<br/>\n&gt; with every round. She left.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That might be a natural conclusion to draw if someone&#39;s only experience was<br/>\nthe tail end of the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as a point of fact and not to be interpretted as being an expert on<br/>\nSandra, I&#39;ve seen her for 6 years in very heated discussions (in the<br/>\npoint/counterpoint folder on the AOL homeschooling boards set up for that<br/>\npurpose) and being &quot;called&quot; on her beliefs doesn&#39;t make Sandra turn tail and<br/>\nrun. So the timing of her departure had nothing to do with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat causes problems is when someone perceives her attacks on ideas as<br/>\npersonal attacks and then personally attacks her in return. That others<br/>\nperceive the situation differently (and call up quotes to &quot;prove&quot; their<br/>\npoint) doesn&#39;t alter Sandra&#39;s intent. Nor, unfortunately, does her intent<br/>\nalter some people&#39;s perceptions. Time usually takes care of that. Or makes<br/>\nit worse.

What of people<br/>\nwho are looked on by others as experts who don&#39;t want that title?

It is *possible* that Sandra didn&#39;t like the lack of control she had on this list. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s not used to people calling her on stuff she says when so many other people treat her as an idol.  Right or wrong (and I&#39;m not getting into *that* discussion with anyone), she chose to  leave and start her own list with her own guidelines.  Nobody&#39;s being a bully... nobody&#39;s calling her ugly names here... in fact, the only posts I recall are ones begging her not to leave. The people who either didn&#39;t have an opinion on that or were glad have remained quiet about it. <br/>\nThere was no &quot;win&quot; or &quot;loss&quot;; only an evolution to another phase that this list will endure. <br/>\nSarah (coming out of lurkdom now that the person who was always snarky to her has left)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Pam Hartley <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 12:46 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Snarky<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ***The <br/>\n  one who has meant so much to so many, was driven off by snarky me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Or maybe she got tired of not being in charge, and tired of the<br/>\n  &quot;general topic&quot; nature of this list.
