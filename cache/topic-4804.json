One problem<br/>\nadoptive parents of these kids often find, is that when members of the<br/>\nchild&#39;s race see the family out in public, they often feel justified in<br/>\noffering unwanted advice, interfering with parenting and in other ways<br/>\nstick their noses in.  There is some sort of &quot;racial belonging&quot; that makes<br/>\nthem think they have more of a claim to the child than the other-race<br/>\nadoptive parents.  I have heard numerous stories from adoptive parents<br/>\nabout being chided or downright upbrarided for some percieved inadequancy<br/>\nin parenting these children.  Adoptive parents of different race children<br/>\nalso feel somehow obliged to humor these intrusions and do their best to<br/>\nplease the entire community of their child&#39;s race (an impossible task.)  It<br/>\nis as if the attitude: &quot;This child is not yours.  You are just borrowing<br/>\nthis child from us, and you really should not have them.&quot;  is infectious,<br/>\nand leaves the adoptive parents feeling like maybe they don&#39;t have as much<br/>\nclaim to raise this child as they see fit, just as they would a birth<br/>\nchild, but maybe they must seek advice from every stranger on the street.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis thinking, and attitude, is just as wrong-headed to me as thinking of<br/>\nchildren as the property of parents.  They are their own people, and<br/>\nentitled to feel out and decide about their own connections to their racial<br/>\nheritage.  It&#39;s our responsiblity to see that they have the tools necessary<br/>\nto develop a healthy self image and cultural identity.  But they are every<br/>\nbit as much a part of the family&#39;s culture as they are any birth culture,<br/>\nand we should take our cues from them about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"LASaliger@xxx.xxx","from":"LASaliger@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"MjRxT5mQn0CeHnQ3wwq3dCRk1IvPHOcn1bcNqmIDs8sGcQQO_HYa4izC2Pxqg1tTYTmMeLVgos8","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Learned helplessness","postDate":"943471654","msgId":4804,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zMTIuNDgwNC45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4812,"prevInTime":4803,"nextInTime":4805,"topicId":4804,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/23/99 10:25:39 PM Pacific Standard Time, shantinik@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1276037690\">In a message dated 11/23/99 10:25:39 PM Pacific Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shantinik@...\">shantinik@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  Hence, we see more<br/>\n passivity and, occasionally, more violence among children -- just<br/>\n different ways of expressing powerlessness -- which is the inevitable<br/>\n result of the three organizing principles. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    So true!
