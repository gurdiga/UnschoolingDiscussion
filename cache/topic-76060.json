It&#39;s been so wonderful to read in this<br/>\nthread about how many other people DON&#39;T leave their kids! I feel less weird<br/>\nnow! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore we defected from corporate life and the city for the isolated,<br/>\nhappier life we now lead in the boonies, and actually had events to attend<br/>\n(lol!), we&#39;d always bring our daughter with us. None of the invitations ever<br/>\nSAID no kids, but it was obviously understood that none would be there. When<br/>\nshe was a baby, I sewed fancy slings to go over the evening gowns, and later<br/>\nshe just walked along with us. Of course at first people would stare like we<br/>\nwere crazy, but of course our daughter always became the life of the party,<br/>\nand by the end of the evening people would always say what a pleasure it was<br/>\nto watch her being her vivacious self.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf an event DOES specifically say -no kids- we don&#39;t attend. We even missed<br/>\na big family wedding earlier this year due to this, and it caused a lot of<br/>\ntension. But too bad - my kids are way more important!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\n~Kelli in California, who has been lurking for about three months and loving<br/>\nthis list.

And, believe me, we are all<br/>\ngoing in several directions often and do get worlds of time (often too<br/>\nmuch) apart. So, when an invitation comes up for me that is on a night when<br/>\neveryone is actually going to be home - no drama endeavors for Nell, no<br/>\nmovie plans for Sky, no sleepovers for Bay, etc - and  I say, no . . .<br/>\nwell, I often get the response that I am somehow being a martyr, or taking<br/>\non too much, or whatever. The simple fact that we all enjoy each other&#39;s<br/>\ncompany and might truly relish an evening together in the hubbub that is<br/>\noften our busy and involved lives seems to go over many people&#39;s heads.<br/>\nBut, when I reflect on just how I did not enjoy being with my parents when<br/>\nI was a teen and how so many people do not relate to their teens . . . I<br/>\nsee that this is a sad comment on society, really. And, that I am truly<br/>\nblessed that my teens like to be with me and with each other! I feel so<br/>\nlucky! <br/>\n<br/>\nLife is too short, really, not to spend all the time we can with our<br/>\nchildren. And, for the record, I did not leave them when they were younger<br/>\nwith anyone and did not attend any functions that did not include them. Oh,<br/>\nthat damn martyr again!<br/>\nLOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, you with younger children - bravo! Perhaps you will inspire someone<br/>\nelse to think before going to yet another senseless adult party, when they<br/>\ncould have been home with their fast-growing children . . . and surely you,<br/>\ntoo, will have teens who actually enjoy you and you them!<br/>\n<br/>\nLove, Lee<br/>\n<br/>\nNorth Country Farms<br/>\nAn Eco-Tourism Destination<br/>\nP.O.
