I actually got Dimetapp into the baby, Dimetapp <br/>\ncough into Sierra and a Claritan into Joseph. I&#39;m still amazed they all took <br/>\nsomething. Of course it was only one dose. &lt;BG&gt; It will be like the old joke <br/>\nabout going to school and after the first day, the child saying, &quot;You mean I <br/>\nhave to do it again??&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far everyone is doing fairly well and myhusband and I have been doing the <br/>\nZicam thing just in case. My oldest is never in the house long enough to <br/>\ncatch what we&#39;re giving!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for those who celebrated, I hope you had a Happy Thanksgiving.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.

I was sitting here,<br/>\nbeing horrified and saddened by the conversations about allopathic<br/>\nmedicines, particularly anti-depressants, but didn&#39;t get it that I could&#39;ve<br/>\nmentioned homeopathy! DUH! I have had tremendous success treating my family<br/>\nwith nothing but homeopathy for the last 14 years. It is wonderful to have a<br/>\nhomeopathic physician, or some sort of holistic practitioner.
