Person A is<br/>\nbecoming violent.  Person B comes up from behind and reaches around Person A<br/>\nwith both arms.  Person B&#39;s right hand holding Person A&#39;s left wrist; Person<br/>\nB&#39;s left hand holding Person A&#39;s right wrist.  Then Person B pulls Person<br/>\nA&#39;s arms tight, criss-crossed across their chest.  Person B can then gently<br/>\nsit down and wrap their legs around Person A&#39;s waist.  You can hang out like<br/>\nthat for a long time without getting too tired and you don&#39;t have to worry<br/>\nabout potential breathing problems that happen with some other holds.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I like best about it is that as Person A calms down, the hold is easily<br/>\nreleased into a hug.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52438,"nextTopicId":52319}}
