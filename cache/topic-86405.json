The problem is that cafepress has <br/>\nsuch a high base price that it&#39;s hard to mark anything up more than a <br/>\ndollar or two and stil have it affordable.  They&#39;ve had the store for <br/>\nabout a year and all the &quot;money&quot; they&#39;ve earned has gone toward their <br/>\npremium store payment and a few products that they&#39;ve bought to show <br/>\noff at homeschooling activities as advertising.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey never actually gotten a check and when they do it will go toward <br/>\nadvertising.  They&#39;re planning on targeting unschooling conferences <br/>\nso the money will probably end up there anyway. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been a wonderful experience for them though even with the lack <br/>\nof profits.
