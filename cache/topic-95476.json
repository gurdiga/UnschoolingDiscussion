Here&#39;s a<br/>\nlink to the article <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/health/features/n_10180/\">http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/health/features/n_10180/</a><br/>\n, which encapsulates nicely the early pressure placed on parents in the<br/>\nNorth East corridor--Washington, DC on through to Boston and probably<br/>\nelsewhere, though I can&#39;t speak to that. The article specifically refers to<br/>\nNY City&#39;s upscale population, but truth is, this pressure trickles down the<br/>\nsocio-economic scale, less-concentrated perhaps, but still very much a<br/>\nreality for most parents here. The Head-Start programs that are pushing to<br/>\nall-day pre-K in this area are no exception. An article in the Washington<br/>\nPost a couple months ago interviewed a Northern Virginia Principal who<br/>\nwanted to eliminated naps from all-day Pre-K in an effort to keep up with<br/>\nearly academic race. He was quoted as saying something along the lines of<br/>\n&quot;this isn&#39;t baby stuff anymore.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s the above reason, but there&#39;s also a sense of the continuity of<br/>\ntrusting a child to learn and providing a warm, supportive atmosphere that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t stop just because children reach compulsory school age. So often<br/>\nwe&#39;ll say to new unschoolers or those thinking about it, &quot;how did your child<br/>\nlearn to walk, to talk, etc.&quot;. In that sense most of us do unschool our<br/>\nchildren from birth--some just lose that sense of trust and give in to the<br/>\nanxiety-producing rhetoric of experts.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95405,"nextTopicId":95142}}
