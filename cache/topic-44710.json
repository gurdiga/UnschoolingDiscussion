I often think alot about the things you touched on in your message... the bipolar part especially.  Noone will talk about these things, and then when they do it seems like they medicate the person,  I wish I knew more about this.  I know of someone now that just told me her son and daughter see visions and I was flabbergasted (sp?)  I guess I have never known anyone personally.. .<br/>\nIts very sad that these people can&#39;t talk about it,  maybe if society was more open to these kind-of ideas we would learn more about it.  And maybe there is alot known about it and I&#39;m just uneducated on it&lt;g&gt;,,,,,anyway,  Michele you get a huge &quot;Good Job!&quot;  on your healing from me; and also in listening to your children, hope I can be as open minded and loving with mine!<br/>\nTake Care, <br/>\nKelli <br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michele-nappi@...\">michele-nappi@...</a> wrote:We have been unschooling for 3-4 weeks now.
