Your<br/>\nResource Consultant will also give you some examples of some of the<br/>\nproducts we carry, that relate to the topic of the workshop. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a unique concept in the home party world and one that has<br/>\nbeen well loved by all who have attended one of our parties. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur Resource Consultants have said they have trouble leaving a<br/>\nparty, because everyone gets so involved talking and sharing with<br/>\none another, it is too much fun to want to leave. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe view this as a great thing! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe hope you will enjoy this experience soon, with your friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nSpring/Summer 2003 : TOPICS TO CHOOSE FROM <br/>\nHow I teach, how they learn - Learning styles <br/>\nFast and simple lesson enhancers <br/>\nHomeschooling the strong willed child -- [I&#39;d love to see the<br/>\nsuggestions on this topic. ]<br/>\nHaving fun with science <br/>\nCreating your own unit/theme studies <br/>\nIn the beginning, Homeschool.
