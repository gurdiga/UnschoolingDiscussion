My dh is<br/>\nasleep :)<br/>\n<br/>\nearlier today:<br/>\nI overslept & missed the early church service.  I had planned to go &<br/>\neven went to bed at a reasonable hour (midnight) AND set my alarm<br/>\nclock (which I rarely do).  But when it went off, I turned it off &<br/>\nwent back to sleep LOL.  And then had a scary dream that woke me up. <br/>\nIt was very vivid!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd & I got up & hurriedly got ready so we could meet our church<br/>\nfriends at a local mosque where we were scheduled to have a tour.  It<br/>\nwas pretty boring for her, but I enjoyed it & she managed to sit<br/>\nthrough it.  Afterwards we got snacks and then we went to the Family<br/>\nArts Festival downtown.  She did several art projects, did some<br/>\ngymnastics with the Danish gymnastics team, stood in line to get her<br/>\nface painted while I shopped at the &#39;friends of the library&#39; book<br/>\ntable.  I found 4 kids books - 3 with the cassette tapes, for only 50<br/>\ncents each!  I was so excited.  Two of them are books my ds likes -<br/>\nwe&#39;ve gotten them at the library: &quot;Ping&quot; and &quot;The Last Dragon&quot;.   Dd<br/>\ndecided to leave the face painting line (it was REALLY long) & did<br/>\nsome more gymnastics.  Then we stopped at a art table & she made a<br/>\nbirthday card for her friend.  Then I bought her an icee and we<br/>\nstopped and said hi to some homeschool friends.  And rolled down the<br/>\nhill a few times.  And then had to take the prickly stickers out of<br/>\nher skirt collected from rolling down the hill.  Then we left for the<br/>\nbirthday party where we met dh & ds.  It was cold & windy, but we<br/>\nmanaged to stay at the park for 2 hours (we&#39;re in Tucson AZ so realize<br/>\nwhen I say cold, I mean cold for Tucson LOL).
