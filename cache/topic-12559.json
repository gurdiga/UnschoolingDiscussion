Does it actually<br/>\n&gt;say, &quot;spare the rod, spoil the child?&quot; I was told that it doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Biblical passages are deciphered differently by different people.<br/>\n&gt;I for one do not take it so literally. I can NOT imagine Jesus<br/>\n&gt;hitting a child, whether He called it spanking or something else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I never felt that hitting/spanking a child was a civilized way of<br/>\n&gt;teaching them right from wrong. I preferred communication. I was<br/>\n&gt;spanked as a child, not &#39;abused.&#39; I suffered from it, and no it<br/>\n&gt;wasn&#39;t often and it wasn&#39;t with great force. It was simply total<br/>\n&gt;humiliation. Spanking IMO is something that is used when patience is<br/>\n&gt;lost and words can&#39;t be found. Listening, REALLY listening to Laurie<br/>\n&gt;worked better than using the spanking/powertrip thing...not that I<br/>\n&gt;ever resorted to hitting her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;love, Valerie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., kate mcdaniel &lt;K8MCD@E...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am astounded at the ridicule of the Proverb &quot;Spare the rod, spoil<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; child&quot;.  As parents we are commanded by God to be responsible for<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; upbringing of our child.  This includes discipline.  Does it mean<br/>\n&gt;to &quot;beat&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them?  NO! It means to correct and discourage them from<br/>\n&gt;disobeying.  That<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sometimes means using a physical form of correction.  Please give<br/>\n&gt;me one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; example of a child that was &quot;spanked&quot; as means of correcting that<br/>\n&gt;has been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; emotionally damaged.  I am not talking about those cases of abuse.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t believe &quot;spare the rod, spoil the child&quot; pertains at all to<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disallowing of a child to attend ps for fear of the bullying he/she<br/>\n&gt;will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; experience. &quot;Spare the rod, spoil the child&quot; pertains to Biblical<br/>\n&gt;discipline<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of our children.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Fri, 04 May 2001 07:46:59 EDT, Unschooling-dotcom@y... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  When I first had children, I heard the comment &quot;don&#39;t pick him<br/>\n&gt;up you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spoil him.&quot;  Luckily I read somewhere that &quot;things only spoil when<br/>\n&gt;left<br/>\n&gt; &gt; alone to ROT!&quot;  ambersand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Nothing irks me more than that saying..&quot;Spare the rod and spoil<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; child.&quot; I always reply....&quot;I prefer a spoiled child to a beaten<br/>\n&gt;one.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  love, Valerie<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., Nanci Kuykendall &lt;aisliin@y...&gt;<br/>\n&gt;wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;I read too much, I think; half of the &#39;experts&#39; say<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;that children shouldn&#39;t be pushed too hard, the other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;&gt;says that their anxieties and fears will overwhelm<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;them later if they don&#39;t learn how to deal with them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;by overcoming teasing etc. in childhood.
