Boy, was I surprised. =-<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure if the puzzle only costs 50 cents or a dollar, missing pieces are just part of the adventure. &lt;G&gt;  But honestly, I&#39;ve bought brand new puzzles with a piece or two missing before, and more often than not, my garage sale and thrift store puzzles have been intact.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Holly and I went to England, we did a lot of thrift store shopping (Dove Shops and Oxfam), and brought back several puzzles.  A couple are of kings and queens of England, one of a gypsy wagon, and one&#39;s a map.  They&#39;re wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we do puzzles, we write inside the box lid if any pieces were missing. And when we&#39;re done, we put the pieces inside gallon ziploc bags (or smaller, if it&#39;s a little puzzle) and sometimes put the border pieces in a separate bag.   We&#39;ve been dating when we worked them, and who all helped, too, which has been fun.  So we open one and find it was worked when friends had visited four years before, or whatever.  Each has its own history.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a puzzle of baseball collector stuff, and I used some of it for a picture (I used my scanner) for the Leaning on a Truck article<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/truck\">http://sandradodd.com/truck</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI put it in the raffle at one of the first Live and Learn conferences (I think the first one, when I was in the hospital), and I don&#39;t know who ended up with it, but I hope she knew it was on my unschooling website, on one of the only pretty pages. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy scanner quit working a couple of years ago.  I really should get another one.  I was having lots of fun with making art for webpages, while it lasted.  A bulb went bad, and nobody will fix cheap scanners, because it&#39;s cheaper, it seems, to just do new ones.  Sad for the dump.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":172750465,"authorName":"b229d655@cs.com","from":"b229d655@...","profile":"robeyboyz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Driving Around","postDate":"1108305738","msgId":103375,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRmLmQxZDA3N2MuMmY0MGMxNGFAY3MuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":103378,"prevInTime":103374,"nextInTime":103376,"topicId":103375,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s so funny that this just came up because I have just spent several days going from thrift store to flea market to store looking for puzzles for Mason ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-242895325\">It&#39;s so funny that this just came up because I have just spent several days <br/>\ngoing from thrift store to flea market to store looking for puzzles for Mason <br/>\n(3.5).  We have always had puzzles around but he never really had interest in <br/>\nthem.  We had one giant floor puzzle and he dug it out and was so thrilled with <br/>\nthe size and fun of it.  He asked for more.  I got out all the other puzzles <br/>\nwe had and he did all of those and really wanted more.  So I thought I could <br/>\njust pick up a few here and there.  We love finding stuff at all kinds of <br/>\nstores but I don&#39;t think I have ever thought of thrift stores as a puzzle place, <br/>\nthinking they may have missing pieces and such.  Boy, was I surprised.  He seems <br/>\nto like the floor size best and they are hard to find and expensive too and <br/>\nwe found at least 6 at several different stores and with all of the pieces.  <br/>\nThey call it treasure hunting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had so much fun driving from store to store and the kids loved digging <br/>\nthrough all the treasures given away.  Andrew (7) told me later that he loved <br/>\ngoing to these stores because they are always different, not like regular stores. <br/>\n He asked if other kids loved the stuff we gave away as much as he loved the <br/>\nstuff that other&#39;s gave away. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was fantastic. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do this every now and then.<br/>\n<br/>\nAround Halloween Andrew wanted to try Boo-Berry cereal (he had seen it on TV) <br/>\nand little did I know that it was a rare item.  He was disappointed several <br/>\ntimes but he was thrilled to race down each cereal isle searching.  Oh, the <br/>\nJOY!!! when he found it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPamela<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103332,"nextTopicId":103382}}
