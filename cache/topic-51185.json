All learning is in brain, muscle, mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;So, if we look at learning from that <br/>\nevolutionary perspective, then language becomes one of the early <br/>\npractices or technologies that humans needed to develop in order to <br/>\nsurvive.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLanguage is not &quot;a technology.&quot; <br/>\nWhen dogs communicate, or honey bees, or birds, or dolphins, that is natural. <br/>\n <br/>\nHumans have involved communications with stories and songs and poems, but <br/>\nit&#39;s still evolved gradually and been passed on naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;What about just changing <br/>\nour perspective of what is language? What if we talked about language <br/>\nas a practice and technology that we have developed and found an <br/>\nagreement over its use through practices such as grammar, <br/>\northography, philology, phonetics, etc. Then what? It does not become <br/>\na natural thing, it is just another ability that can be learned. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNative speakers don&#39;t need those in-depth studies and analyses for their <br/>\nlanguage to work.  There is the natural use of language and then there&#39;s the <br/>\ndissection and analysis of language.<br/>\n<br/>\nA family with traditional building skills can build a shed or barn or house <br/>\nor fence without studying the history of other methods.  They only need what <br/>\nthey learned from their own relatives or neighbors.   Some people like to <br/>\nstudy the idea of building itself, either from an  engineering standpoint, or <br/>\nanthropological, or archeological.  But that is not the same as building.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Timetables? I guess you and I agree that there should not be any, &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTranslate, please.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;table&quot; in &quot;timestables&quot; is a chart which anyone can construct.  It&#39;s a <br/>\npattern of counting. The pattern existed before writing and charts did.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;What I am trying to argue for is to look at language as something <br/>\nthat is just a tool with a set of instructions and that, really, it <br/>\ntakes a lifetime --or a great deal of passion and practice-- to <br/>\nmaster those instructions.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re seeing a lifelong obsession with the essence of language as <br/>\nbeing somehow equal to or on a continuum with just learning and using <br/>\nlanguage in everyday life. It&#39;s a very different thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nA person can be an excellent speaker of a language and have NO idea of how to <br/>\ndiagram sentences or conjugate verbs.  They&#39;re different things, the use and <br/>\nthe analysis.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone can be an excellent musician without knowing music theory.<br/>\nSomeone can be a great baseball player without knowing biomechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I am not saying this is a <br/>\nconscious act for everybody because many people are not aware that <br/>\nFEAR is what drives their every move.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFear doesn&#39;t drive my every move.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you just talking about school-conscious New Yorkers still?  Or have you <br/>\nreally moved on to &quot;everybody&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;They just did not have the tools, <br/>\nthe knowledge of their own language, in order to apply to it to the <br/>\ntype of learning that goes on at a university.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou wanted them to know grammar so you could use that terminology.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have learned second languages for thousands of years, and before the <br/>\ndevelopment of grammar books.  HOW?  By actually going where the people spoke <br/>\nthe language.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people with great talent for learning multiple languages.  There <br/>\nare others without that talent.  But &#39;scientific&#39; school methods ignore that <br/>\nand think that a method of instruction can be developed which will allow <br/>\nanyone equally to memorize rules add verbs and vocabulary and then speak the <br/>\nlanguage.  Classroom language instruction has never been shown to be as <br/>\neffective as going to the place and living among native speakers.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And BTW, the fact that I was teaching the elite (NYU, Rutgers) and <br/>\nthe &#39;non-elite&#39; (BMCC and Manhattan College) taught me that it did <br/>\nnot matter how much money or resources my students had at their <br/>\ndisposal. If they did not know how to use those resources, they just <br/>\nwent to waste.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth were schools.  And the resources were not natural learning experiences, <br/>\nI&#39;m guessing.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Language is really a tool or, if you want to put it into a fun <br/>\ncontext, we could say that words are like LEGO blocks. You can build <br/>\nanything with them. There is nothing to fear in words. There is <br/>\nnothing mysterious about them. Saying that &quot;it will happen when it <br/>\nhappens&quot; is too vague and feeds into that whole fear factor around <br/>\nreading and writing.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI honestly don&#39;t know what you&#39;re saying.<br/>\nYes, language is like blocks.  English is like alphabet blocks that don&#39;t <br/>\nconnect.  Latin/French (where much of English vocabulary arises) are like <br/>\ntinkertoys--they clip parts together to make bigger words.  But that&#39;s an <br/>\nobservation after the fact, and no child needs to know that to learn the <br/>\nlanguages.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;My arguments are for demystifying language; for taking aware the aura <br/>\nof fear around it. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYet you&#39;re describing it as something created, with rules, and unnatural.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Let&#39;s strip reading and writing of their omnipotence in <br/>\nlearning.

Communication is natural; what is used to <br/>\ncommunicate is not. Learning is natural, what is used to learned is <br/>\nnot.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvan was colicky for what it seemed forever. I was going out of my <br/>\nmind because he was 5 months old and still screaming for 3-5 hours a <br/>\nday. The peds were idiots telling me it would go away. It didn&#39;t. <br/>\nThen a friend told me to read THE FUZZY BABY BOOK. It changed my <br/>\nlife. Here I was a post-structuralist literary critic with a heavy <br/>\ndoes of linguistics and something as simple as listening to the <br/>\ndifferent cries of my child just went over me. I had not a clue.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son was colicky because of a breakdown in communication between <br/>\nthe two of us. I had not entered into an agreement with him as to <br/>\nwhat his cryings meant. After reading that book, our relationship <br/>\nchanged. We &#39;spoke&#39;, we worked things out. He cried, I stated my <br/>\n&quot;translations&quot; until, somehow, we found a way to reach an agreement <br/>\nas to what he meant. Same when he entered into his babbling period. <br/>\nWe would translate what he was saying by asking questions. He would <br/>\nnod if he agreed with our translation. Needless to say, when he <br/>\nstarted talking he was extremely pissed off that we could not <br/>\nunderstand what he was saying. We stressed, though, that he was <br/>\nlearning new languages (English and Spanish) and that the transition <br/>\nfrom Evanish to these other languages was sometimes tricky. That&#39;s <br/>\nwhy, when he did not want me to talk to him in Spanish anymore (at <br/>\nabout 3), I really had to back off. He was just overwhelmed and <br/>\nneeded to focus on one new language at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other moments of this &quot;unnaturalness&quot;. We were in the <br/>\nliving room  --he was about 1 year old. Evan was slamming the door of <br/>\nthe VCR console. I asked him to stop. He did. Then I said to him, <br/>\n&quot;close the door&quot;. He looked at me mystified. &quot;Close the door&quot;. Again <br/>\nhe was just two big eyes staring back at me. Then it dawned on me <br/>\n--he had no clue that what he was playing with was called a door. <br/>\nDoors to the apartment, doors to the bedrooms are, well huge things <br/>\nthat open and close. Those where doors. This thing that opened and <br/>\nclosed but was smaller than him, he had no idea that it was also a <br/>\ndoor. So I went to him and pointed to the cabinet door and said, <br/>\n&quot;This is a door just like the front door&quot;, and pointed to that too. <br/>\n&quot;Ooooh&quot;, he said. So we went all around the apartment looking for all <br/>\nthe doors.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not that learning is extrinsic from language. What I am trying <br/>\nto distinguish is between learning the action and the ability being <br/>\nlearned. The fact that human babies have to learn how to suckle <br/>\nreally tells us a lot about the human animal. Humans have had to <br/>\ncreate practices and technologies to support learning just for the <br/>\nsimple reason of survival. So, if we look at learning from that <br/>\nevolutionary perspective, then language becomes one of the early <br/>\npractices or technologies that humans needed to develop in order to <br/>\nsurvive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Being available and useful is all<br/>\n&gt;that&#39;s necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think we are disagreeing but when you talk about being <br/>\navailable, I am not sure what you mean. Do you mean being there when <br/>\nthey need the information to become available to them? If this is <br/>\ntrue, then yes, I agree.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I have an addendum to that argument. What about just changing <br/>\nour perspective of what is language? What if we talked about language <br/>\nas a practice and technology that we have developed and found an <br/>\nagreement over its use through practices such as grammar, <br/>\northography, philology, phonetics, etc. Then what? It does not become <br/>\na natural thing, it is just another ability that can be learned. <br/>\nTimetables? I guess you and I agree that there should not be any, <br/>\nthat learning how to use language can happen at each person&#39;s pace. <br/>\nWhat I am trying to argue for is to look at language as something <br/>\nthat is just a tool with a set of instructions and that, really, it <br/>\ntakes a lifetime --or a great deal of passion and practice-- to <br/>\nmaster those instructions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; The issue with reading, though, is that there is a right way to do it<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  within the context of the proper grammatical use of the language.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The same is true of spoken language. But what barrier or stumbling block is<br/>\n&gt;that to speaking?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, in my example with Evan, the stumbling block is the lack of <br/>\nAGREEMENT over meaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a 15 year old does not read or write at the same level of his or <br/>\nher peers, it is not because that person is slow or behind. They are <br/>\nnot reading at the others &#39;level&#39; because they are not in agreement <br/>\nwith what should be the level or reading or writing for a 15 year-old.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in general terms, unschooling is the opportunity for many of us <br/>\nto allow our children to not be beholden to the mainstream agreements <br/>\nof how, when and where our children should learn. What that creates <br/>\nthough, is a new agreement; or, in political terms, a new social <br/>\ncontract.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  When that happens or should happen, THAT is what is open to debate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And the reasons people debate teaching kids to read is:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) They don&#39;t all realize kids *do* read when given the freedom to do so.<br/>\n&gt;They&#39;re caught in the &quot;Well, maybe that&#39;s true, but I want to be sure&quot; mode<br/>\n&gt;of thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fear is a major factor here. I think that people push their children <br/>\ninto doing things because THEY don&#39;t want to be embarrassed. Fear of <br/>\nembarrassment is what feeds the education industry, no question about <br/>\nit. And I am including the homeschooling section of that industry as <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when I said &quot;by hook or by crook&quot; I meant it in the context of <br/>\nthis fear of embarrassment. Some will go all the way out spending <br/>\nthousands of dollars in reading programs or coaches or whatever. Then <br/>\nthere are those that will medicalize the situation and call it a <br/>\ncondition like dyslexia because that way the blame is not on them, it <br/>\nis on something as abstract as a &quot;condition&quot;. So then, there is an <br/>\nexplanation for why the child can&#39;t read. I am not saying this is a <br/>\nconscious act for everybody because many people are not aware that <br/>\nFEAR is what drives their every move.<br/>\n<br/>\nFEAR is not just an issue related to schooling or education but <br/>\nbasically everything in our lives. Look at the stock market, look at <br/>\nreligion, look at medicine, look at the institution of marriage, look <br/>\nat homeschooling and even, yes, unschooling. A lot of people come to <br/>\nhomeschooling and unschooling out of fear not out of possibility and <br/>\nthat is what informs their decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2) Their goals are different. Someone whose goals are to allow learning to<br/>\n&gt;unfold naturally aren&#39;t going to have the same needs as someone who wants to<br/>\n&gt;&quot;make sure&quot; or someone (like schools) whose goal is to have the kids reading<br/>\n&gt;independently by a certain age.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It&#39;s like two people debating what it&#39;s best<br/>\n&gt;to pack for a hike when they don&#39;t realize one is planning on hiking across<br/>\n&gt;the desert and the other is planning to hike Mt. Everest. Parents&#39; true<br/>\n&gt;goals are masked by thinking their goal is to do what&#39;s best for their kids,<br/>\n&gt;not realizing they aren&#39;t defining &quot;what&#39;s best&quot; in the same way. And often<br/>\n&gt;they aren&#39;t defining it the same way because of fear and ignorance of how<br/>\n&gt;children really learn when given the freedom to learn what they want when<br/>\n&gt;they want it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce, when I was teaching college, a lot of kids knew how to read <br/>\nbut could not make any sense of what they were reading. Sounding out <br/>\nwords is not reading. There are so many things involved in the <br/>\nprocesses of reading and writing and all have to be attended to. <br/>\nWriting was the other big problem --they just could not articulate <br/>\ntheir ideas. I am not saying that they were bad or wrong. What I am <br/>\nsaying is that as a Spanish teacher I spent way too much time <br/>\nteaching English to my students. They just did not have the tools, <br/>\nthe knowledge of their own language, in order to apply to it to the <br/>\ntype of learning that goes on at a university.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd BTW, the fact that I was teaching the elite (NYU, Rutgers) and <br/>\nthe &#39;non-elite&#39; (BMCC and Manhattan College) taught me that it did <br/>\nnot matter how much money or resources my students had at their <br/>\ndisposal. If they did not know how to use those resources, they just <br/>\nwent to waste.<br/>\n<br/>\nLanguage is really a tool or, if you want to put it into a fun <br/>\ncontext, we could say that words are like LEGO blocks. You can build <br/>\nanything with them. There is nothing to fear in words. There is <br/>\nnothing mysterious about them. Saying that &quot;it will happen when it <br/>\nhappens&quot; is too vague and feeds into that whole fear factor around <br/>\nreading and writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy arguments are for demystifying language; for taking aware the aura <br/>\nof fear around it. I guess because I have used everything I can use <br/>\nto deal with my dyslexia, I have no qualms in encouraging people to <br/>\ntry things out with the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHAT DOES NOT MEAN I ADVOCATE PUSHING CHILDREN INTO ANYTHING.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it means is, if the interest is there but the parent is <br/>\noverwhelmed because they are confused with all these messages of what <br/>\nis right and wrong, I am here saying, don&#39;t worry, they are just <br/>\nwords. Let&#39;s strip reading and writing of their omnipotence in <br/>\nlearning. They are just words. Let&#39;s get rid of the mystery and fear <br/>\naround phonemes and phonics. They are just words. It is just as <br/>\nsimple as that.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":83919216,"authorName":"Liza Sabater","from":"Liza Sabater &lt;liza@...&gt;","profile":"lm_sabater","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Fwd: Ten Myths of Reading Instruction (was: learning to read)","postDate":"1039644188","msgId":51248,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEwNTExMWIwM2JhMWQ1YTU3M2ZlN0BbMTkyLjE2OC4xLjEwMV0+","inReplyToHeader":"PGI5LjJiM2Y4MjdmLjJiMjg0OWJiQGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGI5LjJiM2Y4MjdmLjJiMjg0OWJiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":51212,"nextInTopic":51335,"prevInTime":51247,"nextInTime":51249,"topicId":51185,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

TOTAL<br/>\n&gt;waste of emotion. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Reading is not an early imperative because reading is really not a <br/>\nbiological imperative. COMMUNICATION is a human imperative but <br/>\nreading --whether pictures or words is not. There is a confusion <br/>\nbetween the act of communicating and the tools we use to communicate <br/>\nwith. If using signs in such an abstract way as words were natural we <br/>\nwould all have a common language but that is not the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best example that I could think of was with pictures. When my son <br/>\nscribbles on a piece of paper and says that it is a picture of a cow, <br/>\nI have to believe him because to HIM it is. In that instance I am <br/>\nentering into a contract, into an agreement with him. He himself has <br/>\nnot entered into the visual social contract that says that some <br/>\ncircles and lines, fashioned in a certain way even if rudimentary, <br/>\nwill give me the construct of a cow. So even if as cavemen we were <br/>\n&quot;reading&quot; pictures of bison, those pictures are not so much the <br/>\nevidence of Neanderthal reading but probably evidence of one of the <br/>\nearliest language constructs that we have.<br/>\n<br/>\nA language is a social contract. We use words and signs in a certain <br/>\nway because we enter in agreement with the community of speakers that <br/>\nshare the language. Even when we use words in an unconventional way <br/>\n--like COOL! or GUAVA!, for example-- it is still understood that <br/>\nthese sounds mean something. Meaning is not natural. Meaning and the <br/>\nuse of meaning come out of a social agreement that predates all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo communication and the act of creating social contracts is natural <br/>\nto humans. What is not natural, in the sense of being a primal and <br/>\nuniversal function of the human animal, is the social contract <br/>\nitself. That is a construction. Just like a building or garden.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole American phenomenon of education has nothing to do with <br/>\nwhat is natural or not. There is no failure in education --what we <br/>\nhave is a constant and jarring social disagreement on what education <br/>\nis or should be. I do not know when historically reading and writing <br/>\nbecame the markers of education in this society but I am sure that it <br/>\nis traceable to a particular point in time somewhere back in the late <br/>\n19th century.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are very candid in the way you share your children&#39;s unschooling <br/>\njourneys and the value that I see in that is not whether you are <br/>\ndoing the right or wrong thing. What your articles reflect is the <br/>\nworld you have created for your family and the values that you and <br/>\nyour husband have chosen to instill in this little piece of world <br/>\nyour call home. There is no blame, shame or tears but that is not <br/>\nbecause what you are doing is right or wrong in itself but because <br/>\nYOU have chosen to raise your children outside of the, let&#39;s say, <br/>\nmainstream social contract that states that there is something wrong <br/>\nif your child has not done X, Y or Z by a certain age.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I see around me here in NYC is appalling. You see people <br/>\nplunking down 16, 20, 30, 000 for pre-K so that their kids can have <br/>\nthe &quot;right&quot; kind of education. Or they get caught up in the drama of <br/>\ntheir kids being gifted or not gifted and getting coaches and the <br/>\nright books so that they can pass those god damn TAG tests that are <br/>\nsupposed to validate their existence through their children&#39;s <br/>\n&quot;giftedness&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I said that people would make their kids read by hook or by <br/>\ncrook I meant it in the most literal sense. If reading and writing is <br/>\nall they value as being the &quot;proof&quot; of a good education, they will do <br/>\nanything to fix the &quot;problem&quot;.  Most people see their children&#39;s <br/>\nachievements or failures as a reflection of not only who they are as <br/>\nindividuals but of their standing in society. That is, their <br/>\nchildren&#39;s success at hitting all the milestones before everybody <br/>\nelse is as about their own success at completing all the milestones <br/>\nthat we as a society say that we need to hit in order to be <br/>\nsuccessful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this, btw, has no bearing on whether we send our kids to college <br/>\nor not. If not, most homeschoolers and unschoolers would feel <br/>\ncomfortable with the idea of NOT sending their kids to college either <br/>\n--but that is the topic for another discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, fundamentally, I do not disagree with your or Bec or Joyce. What <br/>\nI disagree with is the consideration that reading and writing are <br/>\nnatural activities and not social constructs.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiza<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Fwd: Ten Myths of Reading Instruction (was: learning to read)","postDate":"1039627794","msgId":51212,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3LjI3NTFlZGE2LjJiMjhkMDEyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":51206,"nextInTopic":51248,"prevInTime":51211,"nextInTime":51213,"topicId":51185,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/11/02 5:01:20 AM, fetteroll@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1792296953\">In a message dated 12/11/02 5:01:20 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  It&#39;s like two people debating what it&#39;s best<br/>\nto pack for a hike when they don&#39;t realize one is planning on hiking across<br/>\nthe desert and the other is planning to hike Mt.
