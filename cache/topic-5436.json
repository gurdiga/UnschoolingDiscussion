Also, my children were in<br/>\ncloth diapers and it was much easier to potty train them.  They knew what<br/>\nit felt like when they were wet.  With disposables, IMHO, they can&#39;t feel<br/>\nthe wetness when they go.  It takes longer to make the connection.  Pull<br/>\nUps are horrible to use when potty training for just this reason.  I got a<br/>\nbook, recommended by my wonderful pediatrician, called _Potty Training In<br/>\nLess than a Day_ or something like that.  He said don&#39;t expect to do it in<br/>\na day but use the tips in the book.  All of my children were potty trained<br/>\nat 20 months(I have 5).  It was realitively easy and non stressful for<br/>\nthem.  I must admit the hardest part with the younger ones was having the<br/>\ntime at home to practice.  We carried the potty chair in the back of the<br/>\nvan for my 4th child.
