I found a beautiful quote from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.<br/>\nand am using my aunt&#39;s favorite Carole King song, You&#39;ve Got a Friend, for<br/>\nmy younger cousin&#39;s journal.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t tell you how much all the suggestions helped.  Looking them all up<br/>\nand making the journals has consumed most of the last two days.  Being able<br/>\nto focus the grief is such a wonderful thing.  As a sort of unschooling<br/>\nnote; I&#39;m prone to either ignore my grief or spend too much time feeling it,<br/>\nand I would be prone to do the same thing w/my kids&#39; grief.  I&#39;ve learned a<br/>\nlesson about putting grief into action and I hope that I&#39;ll remember that<br/>\nthe next time my kids express grief of any sort, to offer a way to express<br/>\nit or create some tangible expression for themselves or somebody else.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you again. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith care, <br/>\n<br/>\nKristi <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKristi Hayes<br/>\n<br/>\nMamatoto Advocate<br/>\n<br/>\nGypsyMama.com<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyful mama to Morgaine, Orion, and Isaac<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There are no great things, only small things with great love.
