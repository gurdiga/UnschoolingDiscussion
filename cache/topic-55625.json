I&#39;ll try your nap idea, it may just do the trick. Jason has been home with us for 14 months, do to a pretty serious work injury and he trys to take the kids out so that I can catch a nap but he can only be out for a short period of time before the pain is really overwhelming. He also just started night school so our schedual has changed a bunch.<br/>\nSo far the only other hsers I have met in my area are the &#39;school at home&#39; type or the &#39;we unschool everyting but math and english&#39; so they are usually only free on the weekends. <br/>\nBut we will be moving in the next few months and i&#39;m hoping for a yard and tons of unschoolers in the neighborhood :-)<br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n Pam Hartley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamhartley@...\">pamhartley@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2894<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sat, Jan 18, 2003, 10:15 PM<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; So, on top of the short amount of sleep we are all<br/>\n&gt; getting (they aren&#39;t really old enough for me to go and take a nap<br/>\n&gt; and leave them to thier own devices and going to bed before them is<br/>\n&gt; not an option, at this point) they are so full of energy they ware me<br/>\n&gt; out just watching them and being that i can only watch before i am<br/>\n&gt; drafted into all of there adventures, and we have lots of them, I am<br/>\n&gt; finding my self so tired that i&#39;m rethinking this whole candy thing.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to restict them but I&#39;m at the point that I can&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt; real clear, I&#39;m so tired.
