My neighbor was cutting grass <br/>\nand turned under our tree and stirred up tons of dust.  As the dust was <br/>\nmoving I saw magical rays of sunlight shooting down through the tree.  They <br/>\nwere invisible before that.  It has been quite some time since I have been <br/>\nexcited to see such a thing.  I was amazed...I told the kids about it and <br/>\nthey did their usual &quot;wow, mom!&quot; but they didn&#39;t get to see it.  Wish I were <br/>\na painter, I would paint it.<br/>\nTammy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s easy to forget the sense of wonder that little ones have at what we<br/>\n&gt; consider commonplace things. Everyday I go out to the chookpen to collect<br/>\n&gt; the eggs. Everyday Mia (4) gets excited when we have eggs to bring in. <br/>\n&gt; Every<br/>\n&gt; time I bring home the shopping, the kids are clamouring to see what&#39;s in <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; shopping bags. It&#39;s the same when they watch a movie for the tenth time <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; get just as excited as they did the first time. They bring a sense of<br/>\n&gt; newness to it.  Maybe it&#39;s that their senses haven&#39;t been dulled, they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; totally open.<br/>\n&gt; Julie </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76216,"nextTopicId":13788}}
