I had never heard of yes ma&#39;am <br/>\nin my life and it was all very confusing to me, but I was more confused by <br/>\nthe passion concerning yes ma&#39;am and no ma&#39;am, yes sir and no sir.  And I <br/>\nwas even more confused by people expecting a child who was known to be from <br/>\nthe North to be versed in Southern etiquette.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never did get used to Yes ma&#39;am/no ma&#39;am and somehow managed to slip <br/>\nthrough childhood not using it, finding it repugnant (I think only because <br/>\nof the attitude accompanying).  So it never entered my lexicon.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband was raised entirely southern, his family never having ventured <br/>\nabove the Mason-Dixon line, from backwoods LA and the Gulf.  He said yes <br/>\nma&#39;am and no ma&#39;am.  His father said yes ma&#39;am and no ma&#39;am.  His mother <br/>\nsaid yes ma&#39;am and no ma&#39;am.  It was an address of respect and was used <br/>\nwith everyone regardless of income level or race or age.  Even children <br/>\nwere addressed by ma&#39;am or sir, if &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; was not followed by an <br/>\naffectionate identifier such as &quot;honey&quot;.  I have never heard his family <br/>\ninstruct anyone not in their family to use ma&#39;am or sir, and they have <br/>\nnever instructed our son to use it.  My husband says he has never heard his <br/>\nparents say to anyone, &quot;Yes, what?&quot;  If you weren&#39;t raised to use it as a <br/>\ncustomary address it wasn&#39;t expected.  I don&#39;t know if this is peculiar to <br/>\nthe areas from which my husband&#39;s family came.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still didn&#39;t like it.  It felt fake to my ear.  But many Southern <br/>\nconventions that were supposed to be a matter of respect and neighborliness <br/>\nfelt fake to me, probably because I was thoroughly abused as a child from <br/>\nthe North, and also because I had moved down here pre-integration, to a <br/>\nland of black maids daily bussed in from their poor segregated neighborhood <br/>\nto serve white families, where white swam in their own pools and drank from <br/>\ntheir own water fountains.  So I certainly connected yes ma&#39;am with <br/>\nauthoritarianism and repressiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of years after we were married my husband and I moved to Atlanta <br/>\nand the Atlanta we moved to and move about in is populated by <br/>\nnon-southerners and people from more southern areas who &quot;escaped&quot; to <br/>\nAtlanta.  For a couple of decades I have very rarely heard yes ma&#39;am or no <br/>\nma&#39;am.  My family didn&#39;t adopt it.  My son doesn&#39;t say it nor has anyone <br/>\never requested he do so and his father&#39;s parents have not instructed him to <br/>\ndo so or expected him to do so.  I have only been addressed &quot;Ma&#39;am&quot; once in <br/>\na number of years (on a personal level where I wasn&#39;t a customer) and it <br/>\nwas recently by a friend of a niece, the individual being Vietnamese, his <br/>\nfamily being refugees who moved here in the 70s, and I imagine they took <br/>\nsignificant pains to adopt what they saw as customary and insisted their <br/>\nchildren do so.  I know my Midwest grandmother had told me, &quot;When in Rome, <br/>\ndo as the Romans do&quot;, when I was being moved down South, but I decided not <br/>\nto do so, nor did my family encourage me to do so.  But a Vietnamese <br/>\nfamily--I don&#39;t know but in Vietnam they may have their own system of <br/>\nrespectful address and so were comfortable with it, or felt it especially <br/>\nimportant to adopt the convention as they were refugees.<br/>\n<br/>\nDown here, Ma&#39;am and Sir are part and parcel of systems of address by <br/>\nservice industry workers and that is a matter of  authoritarianism.  Still, <br/>\nI&#39;m infrequently addressed as ma&#39;am and it could be because I never did <br/>\npick up much of a Southern accent and that lack of an accent may signal me <br/>\nas an individual with which that formal address doesn&#39;t need to be used as <br/>\nit&#39;s not expected.  My husband doesn&#39;t get it much either however.  There <br/>\nare certain cues as to use that even my husband goes by as sometimes I will <br/>\nhear him with strangers using yes ma&#39;am, no ma&#39;am, yes sir, no sir.  Or <br/>\nwith certain friends but with those friends it&#39;s a matter of affection.<br/>\n<br/>\nJuli</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Yes ma&#39;am, Miss Yvonne","postDate":"1106953550","msgId":102840,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU0LjNjYWRmMWIzLjJmMmMxZjRlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":102839,"nextInTopic":102842,"prevInTime":102839,"nextInTime":102841,"topicId":102823,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/28/2005 2:22:48 PM Mountain Standard Time, kbcdlovejo@aol.com writes: -=-Sandra s going to get a GOOD dose of ma aming next week!","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2028906185\">In a message dated 1/28/2005 2:22:48 PM Mountain Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n-=-Sandra&#39;s going to get a GOOD dose of ma&#39;aming next week!

First let me give <br/>\na introduction. I am Johanna, wife to Raymond and we have 6 children,the <br/>\noldest is Cindy who is 20 and has our first grandson Caesar Ramon. They <br/>\nlive in Massachusetts. Raymond is our 18 yo  and a talented guitarist, <br/>\nsinger and songwriter. Michael is 14 and loves old cars and drumming. <br/>\nJulian is 12, skateboarding and LOTR are his current passions. Gabriel <br/>\nis 7 and fascinated with anything to do with science or government. Tory <br/>\nis the youngest at 5, very much the little girl, she loves Barbies, tea <br/>\nparties and dressing up.(her choice, not mine) While I have loved the <br/>\nunschooling philosophy for many years, my husband is reluctant to <br/>\nbelieve in it and this does cause tension on occasion. We lived in <br/>\nMassachusetts until 5 years ago. Tennessee is now our home. When we <br/>\nmoved here our whole family went through quite a cultural adjustment. <br/>\nWhile we have always expected common courtesy and respect out of each <br/>\nother as fellow human beings I was surprised how many people here feel <br/>\nlike it is their right to be respected just because of their position. <br/>\nsome have been downright rude but it is executed subtly. The first 6 <br/>\nmonths we were here Cindy and Raymond were in public school by their own <br/>\nchoice and Michael and Julian were also because my husband felt that was <br/>\nbest while we were in the middle of moving to a rental property and <br/>\nbuying our own home. The principal of the middle school gave me many <br/>\n&quot;lessons&quot; in southern authority. I will share one example. Ray came home <br/>\nfrom school one Wednesday afternoon with a note saying he had to write <br/>\n100 times &quot; I will not have a rubber band in the NCE gym.&quot; He was a bus <br/>\nstudent and after class ended the bus students wait in the gym until <br/>\ntheir bus arrives. They are allowed to talk, but have to stay in <br/>\nassigned areas. Ray had a rubber band on his wrist and was snapping it <br/>\nwhen a teacher walked up to him and took it off his wrist. He asked her <br/>\nwhy she took it away. She ignored him so he asked again. She asked him <br/>\nif he would like to discuss it with the principal and he said sure. He <br/>\ngets in trouble for questioning authority. He didn&#39;t do it that night <br/>\nbecause of schedule conflicts and the next day is sent home with a note <br/>\nstating if it is not returned finished the following day he has <br/>\ndetention. We pulled out the student handbook and in it it states if a <br/>\nstudent disputes a disciplinary action, he must state his dispute in <br/>\nwriting, so Ray writes an excellent 2 page letter stating any object <br/>\ncould be construed as a potential weapon and unless there was some <br/>\nintention or attempt to use it as such, he is innocent. The principal <br/>\ndid not like this challenge to authority and I am now called into a <br/>\nparent conference with the principal. after 45 minutes in his office in <br/>\nconference with the teacher I am told I am as rebellious as my son and <br/>\nhe has to do the sentences or he will be suspended from school.
