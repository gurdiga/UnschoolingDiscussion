I do that.  And as a horn player, I frequently have to <br/>\ntranspose music at sight.  I just click my brain into the new key.  If I <br/>\nhave to play in E, my mind just automatically fingers each note a half step <br/>\ndown.  If it&#39;s Eb, I&#39;ll play down a whole step, without thinking about <br/>\nit.  If a piece changes key in the middle, I sometimes have to write in the <br/>\nnames of the first few notes, just to get me in gear.  I&#39;ll have to write <br/>\nin more of the notes if it&#39;s a key I don&#39;t play in very often or there are <br/>\nlots of accidentals to confuse things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I can play piano and talk, if the music is familiar.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t do that with the horn.  &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m learning to do it with the <br/>\ncello.  It&#39;s just that I&#39;m not used to being able to talk and play at the <br/>\nsame time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;On rhythms, I read them in phrase, as pictures.

And with unfamiliar rhythms I sometimes have to actually mark the <br/>\ndown and up beats.  That would be like sounding out unfamiliar words.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I don&#39;t think letters when I type.
