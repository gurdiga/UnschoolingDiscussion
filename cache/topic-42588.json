Now our problem is Moly has been sick to her stomach all day, she feels <br/>\nlike something wrong has happened (it has) and that it is her fault (it <br/>\nisn&#39;t). She said she knew what they did was wrong, I told her she and Jack <br/>\ndidn&#39;t do anything wrong, their grandma did, but since grandma told them not <br/>\nto tell me, that this should all just be their little secret, Moly feels bad. <br/>\nI can fix the MIL problem, I am having a hard time fixing Moly&#39;s feelings. <br/>\n:o( Grandma&#39;s &quot;lets keep this our little secret&quot; crap is snarky and reminds <br/>\nme of what child molesters say to little kids, to keep them quiet. How am I <br/>\ngoing to fix Moly&#39;s feelings of guilt?
