Did you do that or the test?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just did the &quot;Checklist Assessment&quot; from FLO.  It was easy to do and<br/>\n&gt; now I&#39;ve met that legal requirement.  I was more surprised by things on<br/>\n&gt; it that my daughter knew that I didn&#39;t know that she knew.  This<br/>\n&gt; assessment seems to be based on a &quot;typical course of study&quot;.  It had<br/>\n&gt; sections for the 11 subjects that are required in Washington.  Under each<br/>\n&gt; subject, there was a list of things that the typical second grade class<br/>\n&gt; would cover.  I needed to check off the ones my daughter knew.  FLO also<br/>\n&gt; sells a &quot;free style assessment&quot;.  I am told it has spaces to write about<br/>\n&gt; what your child does.  I think I will go that route next time, as it<br/>\n&gt; seems that would be more suitable to unschooling.  We also have the<br/>\n&gt; option of keeping a portfolio (ie, scrapbook) in lieu of testing.<br/>\n&gt; Currently, our law does require that the portfolio or assessment needs to<br/>\n&gt; be reviewed by a person certificated in the field of education.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It helps to remember that WA state law says that the test/assessment is<br/>\n&gt; for the parent.  We do not have to give the results to anyone, but we are<br/>\n&gt; required to &quot;make a good faith effort to remedy any deficiencies&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mary Ellen<br/>\n&gt; alarm clock - n. a device for waking up people<br/>\n&gt; who don&#39;t have small children. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"RValvo7626@aol.com","from":"RValvo7626@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"kd78d_tDcM9T1Q8QdN6LKVGHUqWWAY7kgaiMb9CgKJlTXiL7QEQTG8kCVdsaErJ-c2gF30mDDLEV","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1036","postDate":"984332267","msgId":16919,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVmLjEyMDhjMmRlLjI3ZGQxMWViQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16938,"prevInTime":16918,"nextInTime":16920,"topicId":16919,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/11/01 3:12:15 AM Mountain Standard Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1459444809\">In a message dated 3/11/01 3:12:15 AM Mountain Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Seems weird to me, because I am an unschooler that still calls myself a <br/>\n homeschooler to everybody but fellow unschoolers, because I just don&#39;t want <br/>\n to get into my reasons and the whole thing...<br/>\n April &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    This is us too.
