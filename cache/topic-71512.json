Two of them went to school. One for<br/>\n  four years and one for nine months. They really struggled in the<br/>\n  one-size-fits-all system.  My oldest son, James, started school with a<br/>\n  passion for maths. He liked to do maths problems at home and when I showed<br/>\n  the school what he had been doing they told me it was grade four work. He<br/>\n  was reading novels independently and with a great deal of pleasure. Once in<br/>\n  school, he had to sit through pre-reading sessions and &quot;learn&quot; the numbers<br/>\n  1-10. He was ostracised and bullied and thoroughly miserable. We struggled<br/>\n  along for four years believing that the school was trying to help whilst my<br/>\n  son became increasingly depressed and lost interest in life. The school<br/>\n  tried various strategies including putting him up a grade with mixed<br/>\n  success.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My second son, Matthew, started school reading fluently and with a talent<br/>\n  for maths. He quickly became bored with the easy work given to him and<br/>\n  although a model student at school, came home and gave us all hell -<br/>\n  hitting, kicking, biting and screaming at us. Family life was awful. I<br/>\n  reread parenting books and did a class but life at home was a NIGHTMARE. We<br/>\n  were all so stressed all the time, we didn&#39;t even like each other anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I did some research, found out about unschooling, worked up my courage  and<br/>\n  pulled them out. We have not done any &#39;school&quot; work since but the boys<br/>\n  learn, do and produce amazing things through their own motivation. They love<br/>\n  to learn. Their main objection to school was it was so boring and they<br/>\n  weren&#39;t allowed to learn but expected to sit and wait patiently while the<br/>\n  teacher taught the others what they already knew. My third son, Stephen, has<br/>\n  never been to kinder or school but he spent a huge amount of time there with<br/>\n  me trying to support his brothers, attending meetings and helping out in the<br/>\n  classroom. He hated it and missed out on a lot at home as a result.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Since being at home (2 1/2 years now), James is no longer depressed and<br/>\n  withdrawn, Matthew&#39;s stess levels are down and his behaviour has improved,<br/>\n  Stephen is happier because he has his brothers with him all the time. They<br/>\n  are great friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooling gifted kids works and is exciting, rewarding and so much less<br/>\n  stressful than trying to keep them in school!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Susan<br/>\n  &gt; Message: 16<br/>\n  &gt;    Date: Fri, 30 May 2003 21:20:43 -0400<br/>\n  &gt;    From: &quot;Betjeman and Barton Tea Merchants&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:karen@...\">karen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Subject: Gifted and special needs unschooling. ???<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I have a friend who has 3 kids - the oldest is &#39;gifted&#39; (Katherine) , her<br/>\n  middle girl has learning difficulties (Carolyn) and the youngest is<br/>\n  essentially unknown (she&#39;s 3).<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; My friend, Tina  would love to know if anyone has experience unschooling<br/>\n  kids with such different needs.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Tina is IMO sort of anti-homeschooling and she really doesn&#39;t &#39;get&#39;<br/>\n  unschooling.
