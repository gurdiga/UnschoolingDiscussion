My daughter is 4, but we have always known we were going to hs. When it would come up in conversation, I would get the usual blow off statement &quot;Oh, I couldn&#39;t hs MY children, they are too social for that.&quot; My daughter is I think, the most social person I know. Not only do we hs, but she is also an only child. She has many friends, she is involved with theater groups, gymnastics, and she has a whole lot of fun doing beauty pageants. With the pageants, she gets to do charity work, have parties, ect.  Courtney nearly always has something going, and is about the busiest 4 year old I know. I think many people say comments like that because they have misconceptions about home schooling. Same goes with pageantry. They don&#39;t see the whole picture, I think they get hung up on one aspect, and don&#39;t find out any more.<br/>\nI completely agree that hs children are, from what I have seen, at least as much, if not more social than ps children.<br/>\n          Candy Oliver<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: donabak <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, January 12, 2002 7:36 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Ex-Husbands Who Used to Support Homeschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I appreciated your comments on socialization, Bridget. Something that <br/>\n  I have been doing since starting with unschooling in November is to <br/>\n  log the number of hours that my kids socialize. Amazingly, I see the <br/>\n  time going up, compared to when they were in school.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A parent of a ps student told me flat out that I was exaggerating <br/>\n  because &quot;all the time in school the kids are socializing&quot; I wonder if <br/>\n  this parent spends much time in the classroom and sees what happens <br/>\n  when children try to socialize in class ... they get ridiculed or <br/>\n  worse, put in the hallway. I will grant that they do get to freely <br/>\n  socialize on the playground for about 1 1/2 hour during the day.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Because I feel less stressed with the kids being at home and because <br/>\n  they don&#39;t have homework at night, I allow their friends to come over <br/>\n  almost every night. They socialize between 3 and 5 hours a day during <br/>\n  the week and as many as 12 hours per day on the weekends, not <br/>\n  including the nights they have sleepovers. How much more social do <br/>\n  they need to be???<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have also been fed the argument that my kids won&#39;t be able to <br/>\n  identify with their ps buddies as they won&#39;t have the same <br/>\n  experiences and won&#39;t have any reason to maintain their relationships <br/>\n  (eg. school dances, field trips etc.) To this I respond, that I have <br/>\n  kept in contact with a grand total of 1 (one) friend from my <br/>\n  junior/senior high school years out of the 600 people I graduated <br/>\n  with. The school environment did not help me foster life-long <br/>\n  friendships.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My kids didn&#39;t play with kids from their ps school anyway. I sent <br/>\n  them to a school outside of our designated district, so for the most <br/>\n  part, their friends are our neighbours, not their classmates. <br/>\n  Comments?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dona  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

High divorce rates, dysfunctional families, lots of<br/>\ndepressed people, etc.  Unless you live in an isolated, rural area, it is<br/>\nlikely that your unschooled child will end up becoming involved in<br/>\nactivities as she grows and will have plenty of opportunity to interact<br/>\nwith others.  Besides, children learn how to &quot;relate&quot; to others within<br/>\nthe family first.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m with Dawn.  I wish I could say no to more of the numerous<br/>\nopportunities my children have to spend with others.  Monday was a school<br/>\nholiday so they played with neighborhood schooled friends.  Tuesday, dd<br/>\nwas invited to a neighbor&#39;s house, then both dd spent the evening with<br/>\nfriends while I attended the babysitting co-op meeting.  Today,<br/>\nhomeschooled friends came to play from 11 to 3, then we went roller<br/>\nskating for two hours.  Tomorrow we have girl scouts (a homeschool<br/>\ntroop).  Friday they will come with me to a LLL meeting, where there will<br/>\nbe other children.  This week is a little busier than usual, but fairly<br/>\ntypical.<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nGain weight...
