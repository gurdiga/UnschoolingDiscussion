Thanks.<br/>\n&gt; Carol B.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, it is interesting to see if these &quot;concepts&quot; actually &#39;fly&#39; in real<br/>\nlife.  The book (which I am still picking though - I have to say<br/>\nunfortunately its not very well written) is called &quot;Parachutes for Parents,&quot;<br/>\nby Bobbie Sandoz.  She uses some beautiful analogies and metaphors to<br/>\ndescribe a child moving from dependence to independence, as a natural<br/>\nprocess akin to a caterpillar eventually becoming a butterfly (with no need<br/>\nto *push*  competitively toward accelerated &quot;progress&quot;.  She also goes over<br/>\nhow neither over controlling nor overly permissive styles of parenting work<br/>\nwell... (which is rather obvious, but we all fall somewhere on that<br/>\nspectorm)  Then she gives the &quot;concept&quot; I spoke of as a way to be both<br/>\nnurturing and provide boundaries in all situations.  In short how to marry<br/>\nthe two, and in so doing do away with swinging back and forth from one<br/>\nextreme to the other.(*POWER STRUGGLES*)<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples of how I have been using this concept....<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are tons of them every day- every time my boys don&#39;t act exactly the<br/>\nway I want or expect them to act.  Lets say we have to go run a short errand<br/>\nand my son doesn&#39;t want to go!  No way no how!  In the past I would have<br/>\ngotten worked up about how &#39;uncoperative&#39; he was being and how he was being<br/>\nimmature or over reacting or making a big deal out of nothing etc... and as<br/>\nI got going inot my high horse, I would eventually (if he still wasnt<br/>\ncoperating) start getting less than loving in my interaction with him.  I<br/>\nwould say things sersely through a strained face.... there would be a bite<br/>\nin my voice, an undertone of dissaproval (or worse) and he would feel bad.<br/>\nNow, I would have an entirely different attitude.  I would reamain loving<br/>\nand supportive while he blubbered and tryed to convince me that it would<br/>\nabsolutely KILL him to have to come along on the errand.  But since I am<br/>\nclear that we need to go, all I would do accept his emotionality (or<br/>\nwhatever behavior) and tell him we still need to get going.  No<br/>\ncondemnation, no anger, but also no wavering, no being overly sympathetic.<br/>\nAt first, I noticed this attitude threw my kids off-guard, and made them<br/>\nreally let loose, to try to get the emotional reaction from me... to try to<br/>\nget me to either &quot;give in&quot; or get angy and react.  But since I&#39;m not going<br/>\nto bite... usually they let it go soon after remarkably quickly.<br/>\nAnother thing I have started doing, which uses the same principals, is with<br/>\nmy youngest son (5, almost 6) who has a hard time zeroing in on tasks.  He<br/>\nis still very lost in the world of imagination... and is easily distracted.<br/>\nI used to up the anti to make to get him to do things, (like picking up his<br/>\ntoys when he is done playing with them) by either being a little threatening<br/>\n( if i have to remind you one more time your not going to get to play with<br/>\nthis toy for a week...) or raising my voice.  Now if I see it is something<br/>\nwhere hi is losing his focus, I (gently and lovingly) guide his hands so<br/>\nthat he keeps doing it untel it is done- but it is still him that has done<br/>\nit, and again, he doesnt feel bad about himself, because I haven&#39;t been<br/>\ndisapproving of him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this explains a little more... I am really grateful I came across this<br/>\nbook when i did- I was at a point where I was really receptive to some comon<br/>\nsence ideas to help eleviate the &quot;stress&quot; I was feeling parenting the way I<br/>\nwas.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua<br/>\nKelowna B.C.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"burkfamily@aol.com","from":"burkfamily@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"rsYta1SrC8j0F1hOvIUQQjPr31FREUSlGz4UPqb2TNJxqdp_M5pv2nD7x3RMIcJD-8l-8pYga6TI","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: keeping balance/tricky parents...","postDate":"951412108","msgId":6754,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40MzIuNjc1NC45NTkyNjk3NDdAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6750,"nextInTopic":6797,"prevInTime":6753,"nextInTime":6755,"topicId":6737,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Joshua Heath wrote:  Please do.
