It&#39;s unfair to expect a<br/>\nkid to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; clean up a room covered wall-to-wall with toys, games, pieces of toys,<br/>\netc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He says the right number of toys is probably about 10. That&#39;s right, 10<br/>\n&gt; &gt; toys!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For toddlers, he suggests a toy library concept. The child can play with<br/>\none<br/>\n&gt; &gt; toy at a time. When he wants another toy, he brings you what he has. You<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trade it for a new one. Nothing gets left out.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I thought about that when we were revising things around here.  But then I<br/>\n&gt; watched how they play.  They drive their cars up to the dinosaurs and then<br/>\n&gt; on top of the dinosaurs.  They build things with Duplos and then put the<br/>\n&gt; cars in their structures etc.  They can take bins from one room to another<br/>\n(like the play food<br/>\n&gt; so the cars and dinosaurs and babies can eat).  So far it is working but<br/>\n&gt; I did consider the one toy at a time concept.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mine are 5 and 3 in two weeks and 2 days.
