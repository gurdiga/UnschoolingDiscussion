When I offer answers, I am occasionally told that what I&#39;ve just <br/>\nexplained can&#39;t be true unschooling because... x, y, z. Or they wonder if I know how the <br/>\nkids are learning, or if I worry about their choices, or... <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I was driving around thinking, I realized that there may be a fundamental <br/>\nmisconception of unschooling that underlies the questions. While some school-at-homers <br/>\nmisunderstand unschooling to be &quot;free time for personal interests&quot; after minimal required <br/>\nwork is done (and we say, that&#39;s not unschooling), there are others who actually think <br/>\nunschooling means the kids are completely unattended and that they learn exclusively by <br/>\nosmosis without ever studying or applying themselves to a topic in any kind of systematic <br/>\nway.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if a homeschooling friend hears from me that one of my kids is studying math with a <br/>\ncurricula, I&#39;m told, &quot;But I thought you unschooled.&quot; If my daughter takes a French class, <br/>\nthey think she is no longer unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey wonder how my kids learn to handwrite. One of my kids uses a handwriting book. <br/>\nShe asked for one. She wants to learn cursive. She thinks it&#39;s fun to fill it in. But I get the <br/>\nimpression that some people think unschoolers learn cursive by simply growing up. And if <br/>\nin simply growing up the child didn&#39;t learn cursive, then unschooling &quot;failed&quot; her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read to the kids every day. We talk about what we read and often it leads to follow-up <br/>\ndiscussions and interest in a topic of historical interest. This looks a lot like what people <br/>\ndo who use Sonlight or Greenleaf for their &quot;history studies.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYet I know that it is nothing of the sort. There is no requirement to listen to me, the kids <br/>\nhelp me pick the books and I am not testing or evaluating how much information they <br/>\nretain. I&#39;m not trying to &quot;cover an era of history&quot; for its own sake. Yet they are learning <br/>\nhistory too.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is all about involvement in our kids&#39; lives, living our values and ideas before <br/>\nthem, learning along side them, giving them resources to sate their curiosity and honoring <br/>\ntheir desire to study or prepare for whatever interests them. (Whether that study is for a <br/>\ncurrent passing interest or is somethiing they perceive as necessary to a future they <br/>\ndesire, like college or art school or joining a rock band).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is *not* leaving kids unattended and withholding curricula or classes or anything that <br/>\nmight be misunderstood as &quot;schoolish&quot; in an attempt to say that my kids learned <br/>\neverything they needed without anyone&#39;s help or input. I think some people imagine <br/>\nunschooling must be kids in a home doing virtually nothing but playing video games and <br/>\nyet somehow magically come out at 18 with ACT scores in the 30s on their way to a <br/>\nprestigious college, and if that doesn&#39;t happen, then somehow unschooloing failed...<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100739,"nextTopicId":100574}}
