I got my <br/>\npsychology degree first and then worked in a daycare with infants for <br/>\nseveral months, two year olds for several months--I later had those <br/>\nsame two year olds in my preschool class.  I then worked in a  <br/>\nMontessori school for a couple of years before I decided to get my <br/>\nel. ed. license.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I saw in the ps during practicumms and student teaching, along <br/>\nwith kids I knew, left me knowing one thing--that young children are <br/>\nfascinated with the world, thirst to know more about it, and revel in <br/>\nlearning but by the time many reach second grade or so they view it <br/>\nas drudgery.  So I was left with the vague notion that there must be <br/>\nsomething about the way schools do what they do that turns children <br/>\noff.  I knew (from what I learned in my psych classes about how <br/>\nlearning happens) that it revolved around the fact that people learn <br/>\nwhat they care about and how they can fit new info into already <br/>\nexisting connections and that people make these connections very <br/>\ndifferently.  I knew from my own experience in ps that learning for <br/>\nme, in that context,  meant figuring out what the teachers wanted, <br/>\nmemorizing it so I could spit it back to them and then promptly <br/>\nforgetting most of it.  I saw that even if I wanted to base my <br/>\nclassroom around child-led learning and intrinsic motivation, it <br/>\nwould be very difficult to do in most ps what with grades, and <br/>\nstandardized testing and school wide &quot;management&quot; systems.  Not to <br/>\nmention that parents wanted feedback in the form of grades and test <br/>\nscores so saying something like &quot;Zach is really good at figuring out <br/>\nhow machines work&quot; wouldn&#39;t cut if for most.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, then I had kids and stayed home with them.  Sent my kids to <br/>\npreschool and ps until about a year and a half ago.  I had a friend  <br/>\nwho homeschooled (school at home) her kids for religious reasons and <br/>\nwe had many discussions with me saying that hsing was not a good <br/>\nthing and kids needed the exposure of schools.  I really thought that <br/>\nif I was an involved parent and supplemented my kids interests at <br/>\nhome that schools would be fine.  My oldest child hated school, from <br/>\nthe Montessori preschool he went to through the second grade at ps he <br/>\nattended.  We couldn&#39;t afford private schools because we felt it was <br/>\nmore important for me to be home with them than to work to pay for <br/>\nit.  I really didn&#39;t view hsing as an option, I thought hsers were <br/>\nreligious conservatives who wanted to make sure that their views <br/>\nweren&#39;t questioned by their children too early. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat changed my mind?  Well, my son was becoming very negative to any <br/>\nexperiences at home that resembled learning, was almost always in a <br/>\nbad mood when he came home.  I read a book called &quot;Coloring Outside <br/>\nthe Lines&quot; in which a man who designed artificial intelligence for <br/>\ncomputers and therefore had studied a lot about how learning works, <br/>\nwrote about how to get your kids through public school with their <br/>\ncritical thinking, creativity and love of learning in tact.  It <br/>\nechoed what I already knew, that most ps were not environments in <br/>\nwhich real learning could thrive.  Bush became president and I knew <br/>\nif his education plan were implemented things would only get worse.<br/>\nI thought about what I wanted most for my children.  It was to grow <br/>\nup to be kind, thoughtful people who followed their hearts and <br/>\ndesires and what they thought to be right without regard to what <br/>\nothers thought.  Well then it was like duh! if that is what I want <br/>\nfor me kids then I better start modeling it and psing would only <br/>\nhinder most of my hopes for them.  So we started hsing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile learning about hsing it didn&#39;t take me long to stumble across <br/>\nunschooling and it resonated with me right away and here I am.  And <br/>\neven though I really believe it is right I still struggle with the <br/>\ntrust thing sometimes.  And I still struggle with the perceptions of <br/>\nothers when they ask my kids about their hsing and they say things <br/>\nlike &quot;We don&#39;t do school, we just play.&quot;  And I believe that is <br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t have the trust thing down yet. But I am getting <br/>\nbetter and reading here and other places helps a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In a message dated 9/1/02 10:14:21 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd@a... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Welcome (from another former secondary English teacher who <br/>\n </span></blockquote>minored in <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; psychology)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am in a question asking mood tonight! &lt;g&gt; I already asked Pam a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>nosy <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; question, so here is Sandra&#39;s!<br/>\n&gt; Sandra, I read once, somewhere, in an introduction to something you <br/>\n </span></blockquote>wrote or <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; something someone wrote about you, (or maybe I imagined it all! <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Correct me if <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am wrong.) that you once discouraged a friend or family member <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(?) from <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; homeschooling.

I did a 180, but up until now I&#39;ve been too proud to admit it.  lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother told me in early 1996 that he was thinking about <br/>\nhomeschooling his girls.  He was very (overly, IMO) worried for their <br/>\nsafety if they had to leave the nest of Catholic school and move in to <br/>\npublic school in 6th grade.  (In their area, Catholic school only went <br/>\nto 5th.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to talk him out of it.  I used the usual objections--and I added <br/>\nthat I thought it was &quot;easy for him to say&quot;, when he travels most of the <br/>\nweek and his wife would be stuck home doing it all without him. <br/>\n Socialization, yada, yada.  Since I was a Southern Baptist at the time, <br/>\nI even said he had an obligation to the unsaved masses to keep his <br/>\nchildren in school as a good example.  (:::excuse me while I blush at my <br/>\nown arrogance:::::I didn&#39;t even understand that Catholics weren&#39;t <br/>\ninterested in &quot;saving&quot; people.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had obviously read up on it, and gave me some good arguments about <br/>\nsocialization and the crowd control issues of school, etc.  In the end, <br/>\nhe decided to devote his efforts to convincing their school to hire a <br/>\n6th grade teacher, which they did.  I never spoke with him about why he <br/>\ndecided that.  (I&#39;ll bet he doesn&#39;t know that his eldest daughter, now <br/>\n17, has complained for years to my father about Catholic school, and how <br/>\nshe is never going to church again once she leaves my brother&#39;s house.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was in October of that year that my mid-kid&#39;s experience with middle <br/>\nschool reached critical mass.  He got suspended for fighting, under that <br/>\nzero tolerance policy that apparently didn&#39;t apply to the girl he was <br/>\nfighting with.  (I&#39;m not bitter anymore...well, maybe just a little. <br/>\n lol)  When I got the phone call from the principal and heard the story, <br/>\nI *instantly* thought of homeschooling and my conversations with my <br/>\nbrother.  My son never went back.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut seriously, how can I be bitter about an incident that has led to the <br/>\nmost wonderful, joyful living I&#39;ve ever experienced.  I&#39;m thankful to my <br/>\nbrother that he brought it up, too.  Who knows what would have happened <br/>\nif I had never heard of homeschooling?  Life hasn&#39;t always been rosy, <br/>\nbut I shudder to think what my son might have been like if he had been <br/>\ntreated the way he was in school for 6 more years.  All five of us have <br/>\nbenefitted, but his little brother is the one who is getting the best <br/>\npart.

When her first (of eventually five) was nearly <br/>\nschoolage, I was a new teacher and all excited about it, and she said &quot;We&#39;re <br/>\nthinking of homeschooling Paul,&quot; and I said that was no good, what about <br/>\nthis, what about that, what about socialization, what if all the smart kids <br/>\nwere taken out of school, blah blah blah...<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If this is true, what is it that made you decide to do all that you have <br/>\ndone?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt really bad when I realized what a tacky bad thing I had done, and <br/>\ncalled her almost that second.  The bad thing was, she was down to three or <br/>\nfor kids still in school (one almost out of high school, I think--the second <br/>\none, a girl).  Some did come home, even that year.  All ended up back for <br/>\nbasketball at some point.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Has anyone came <br/>\nfrom being against homeschooling for what ever reason and now supports it so <br/>\nmuch? Why, how come, and what made the difference??&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d guess most people were against it vaguely when it first came up, whether <br/>\nfrom  years of justification and trust that the arguments given us had <br/>\nvalidity, or the Stockholm Syndrome (being discussed here or somewhere today <br/>\nin relation to a kneejerk defense of school).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was at a La Leche League playgroup meeting, sitting on a blanket with five <br/>\nor six other moms I knew well, at Hoffman Park in Albuquerque.  I remember <br/>\nthe whole day, the sky, etc., because I had a lifechanging moment.   It&#39;s <br/>\nwhen I first considered MAYBE considering homeschooling.  I think Kirby was <br/>\nonly three so it wasn&#39;t a real consideration yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend Rhiannon (I still know her, saw her at the store Wednesday) was <br/>\nsaying she was thinking of homeschooling.  Some of the people there were <br/>\nhomeschoolers, most weren&#39;t, most didn&#39;t have schoolaged kids.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI gave a teacherly argument against it, in a way, in answering one of the <br/>\nmoms&#39; question about WHY schools were so against homeschooling.  I said <br/>\n(truly, I still believe it, but it&#39;s not the ONLY reason)  &quot;They&#39;re afraid of <br/>\npeople buttf***** their kids.&quot;  It was too blunt for that group that day too, <br/>\nbut I blurted it out because so many parents seem to think that there are NO <br/>\nhorribly abusive families.  And from the inside of the school, I think most <br/>\nteachers have known kids who would miss a week of school and it was because <br/>\nthe bruises needed time to heal.  I had one, a teenaged girl who was probably <br/>\nalso being sexually assaulted by her dad.  I didn&#39;t do anything and it haunts <br/>\nme and will haunt me until I die.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said to Rhainnon, &quot;What if Lily would like school as much as I did?&quot;  (and <br/>\nI truly did have some of my best times ever in school, in band, in choir, <br/>\nhanging out with teachers during the 40 minutes I waited for the bus every <br/>\nday, getting to know the librarian...)  I thought it was a pretty powerful <br/>\nquestion and I&#39;d win that round.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhiannon calmly said something very like, &quot;What if Kirby hates if as much as <br/>\nI did?  Most people do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRhiannon won, hands down.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause while I DID like school, I knew from third grade that the majority of <br/>\nthe kids did not, and that some were crushed by it, by being retained a <br/>\ngrade, by not speaking English well enough and there being a rule against <br/>\neven asking a question or playing at recess in Spanish, and some were <br/>\nsocially eroded by lack of popularity, or incessant teasing.  And some killed <br/>\nthemselves.  Two of my friends had shot themselves in the head rather than <br/>\nface the next day.  One when we were 14, one when we were 15.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so at that moment, homeschooling because a viable option for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"hsmominoz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Newbie/ Now, What made you turn around?","postDate":"1030937798","msgId":42669,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExZi4xNWQ5NzVlMi4yYWE0MzZjNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":42673,"prevInTime":42668,"nextInTime":42670,"topicId":42669,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/1/02 10:14:21 PM Central Daylight Time, ...
