And even though she has learned the letters and <br/>\nnumbers with such ease, it may be late before she rides a bike or reads a <br/>\nbook on her own, but I know it will come in its time.

We have called ourselves carschoolers for a long <br/>\ntime! Our favorite for the car is trivia-we have had lots of trivia cards <br/>\nthat we keep in the van, and we found a great Asimov book at Half Price <br/>\nBooks full of interesting facts that has sparked alot of learning. We read <br/>\nstories in the van, sometimes we play spelling games or math facts.

Diagramming sentences doesn&#39;t <br/>\ncome up to often in my real life either, so maybe a ps-er or a <br/>\nschool-at-homer would be better at that than we are, but guess what-I don&#39;t <br/>\ncare!!<br/>\n<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t the whole thing just crack you up? I find it pretty funny that <br/>\npeople really take these things so seriously. Is it really worth all the <br/>\ngrief to make sure your kid knows all the things that some mysterious <br/>\nexperts have decided that they must learn by the time they are 6 or 10 or <br/>\n16?

I <br/>\nremember Mikey jumping off the counter when he was 3-over and over and over. <br/>\nI think that would be learning about gravity. I remember making <br/>\ncookies-isn&#39;t that chemistry? Lets see, we planted flowers-earth science, <br/>\nfound worms-biology. We read books and talked-language arts. We watched <br/>\nSesame Street on satelite from Canada so all my kids thought the last letter <br/>\nof the alphabet was zed-foreign language. They counted plates around the <br/>\ndinner table-math, once when there were 3 of us around the table someone <br/>\npointed out that we were a C of people-creative thinking. We went to the <br/>\ngrocery store and learned to push little carts without running in to <br/>\npeople-force, and social skills. Learning to operate the VCR and the TV-life <br/>\nskills?! Oh, the crayons and the scissors-art and fine motor skills. Large <br/>\nmotor skills too-guess that takes me back to jumping off the counter! And <br/>\nnone of that even hints on health and nutrition and budgets-I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve <br/>\nall heard some about that when they want to go to McDonalds!<br/>\n<br/>\nRelax, okay? These little people are learning more and learning faster than <br/>\nthey ever will again. If you want to make sure anyone is learning now, let <br/>\nit be living joyously. The kids usually have that one down from birth-its us <br/>\nwho need the lessons from them.  My last one is a great joy teacher. I learn <br/>\nfrom her all the time. Remember that this is a wondrous and precious time in <br/>\nthe life of your family. Cherish it and enjoy it, don&#39;t sweat the ABC&#39;s or <br/>\nthe counting. They will come in their own time.

All lof those are<br/>\n*doing verbs*.  How could you not learn when you are so busy doing things?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to do a good job of this, as yesterday was a very long day and<br/>\nmy husband&#39;s stupid alarm clock woke me up....not him, but me.  He&#39;s still<br/>\nasleep over there. So forgive me if I make little sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3 year olds are absolutely stunning in the learning department. They are<br/>\nwatching the entire world, storing away bits and pieces of information.<br/>\nThings like when it rains the gutters down my Mrs. B&#39;s house fill up and are<br/>\nso much fun to splah in..  now why won&#39;t our gutters fill up???  And when we<br/>\nhave to go shopping mom spends an inordinate amount of time getting ready?<br/>\nWhy?  and what is this stuff called money?  and what can&#39;t I have that toy<br/>\nin the window, I want it for goodness sakes.  The TV being too loud makes<br/>\nDaddy cranky.  These people seem to always want me to be picking stuff up.<br/>\nWhat&#39;s wrong with letting it stay right where  it is??<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s making all of these kinds of connections, and you want her to be able<br/>\nto parrot back the ABC&#39;s?  Which by the way make no logical sense .. they<br/>\nare just squiggly lines with names.-  Instead she spends  her time thinking<br/>\nabout the entire world and her place in it.  She needs to know how things<br/>\nwork and she&#39;s going to ask you a million questions. It&#39;s &quot;inside&quot; those<br/>\nmillion questions where you can see learning is taking place.  And true<br/>\nlearning has nothing to do with parroting back factoids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not to say you don&#39;t sing the ABC song or talk about which letter<br/>\nstarts mommy. One of my fondest memories is going to the drug store in VA.<br/>\nSara was not quite 3 at the time, and potty trained.  She kept saying P ...<br/>\nP... P... and I kept saying okay, we&#39;ll find a potty.... she kept saying<br/>\nNo... P..... FINALLY,  I realized we were in People&#39;s Drug store and she was<br/>\ncalling out every &#39;P&#39; she was seeing, which was quite a few. &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you spend time living a full and wonderful life, then the experiences<br/>\ngiven your children will be the canvas from which they learn. You will be<br/>\nable to trust the process of learning, because you will trust the process of<br/>\nliving your own life and of sharing it with your children.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Julie, she&#39;s 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisaKK<br/>\n<br/>\n ----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jaam1224@...\">Jaam1224@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jaam1224@...\">Jaam1224@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, August 09, 2000 6:49 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] young unschoolers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;Okay I have a question for everyone with children over three.
