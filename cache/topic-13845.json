We have been deschooling for the last 3months - I do <br/>\nsuggest things to do occasionally - then i leave it up to toni.  I <br/>\ncan see an improvment. She does have good days.  Today she spent <br/>\nabout 45mins answereing her emails. She has e pals in UK and <br/>\namerica.  She then did 2-3 pages of math from the work book.  THe <br/>\nmath work book is the only formal work we do and I ask for one page a <br/>\nweek.  So things are improving.<br/>\nTo the mum whos child still has PJ&#39;s on at lunch time - Toni usually <br/>\nstays in her PJ&#39;s until almost lunch, unless we are going out.  She <br/>\nis a night owl - not going to sleep untill 10.30pm-ish and getting up <br/>\nabout 9.30am and lying around until lunch - she does her best work <br/>\nlate afternoon early evening.  <br/>\nAt first I had problems with this as i am a morning person - up at <br/>\n5.30am - but I have now accepted that our body clocks are different - <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had a good day today - we still have terible days  - but not <br/>\nas often...<br/>\nmarianne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13842,"nextTopicId":13849}}
