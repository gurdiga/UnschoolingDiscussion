Don&#39;t set him up to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven better would be to take him out so he can pick out his own treat.<br/>\n********************<br/>\n<br/>\n The situation with the Koosh was very straightforward. My son knew who it belonged to. He knew it wasn&#39;t given to him. He wanted it, so he took it. Generally normal behavior at some point in a child&#39;s life. The problem was that when we brought it back to recess and the boy asked for his toy back, he maintained the lie even though it brought the other boy to tears. We have plenty of sensory type toys at home, including Koosh style balls. I&#39;m not sure why this one had more meaning to him than the ones we already have.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the candy goes, the kids have access to a variety of candy at all times. We have a big candy jar right on the counter - chocolate, gum, hard candy, mints, the works. Every time we go to the grocery store, we pick out something fun to add to the jar. There are even little single packets of Whoppers in there leftover from Halloween. :) But he still opened the malt balls the girls&#39; dad got them in a sneaky way and lied about it when they were upset with him. Again, I&#39;m not sure why these malt balls had more meaning to him than the ones we already had.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is exactly why we are struggling with this. He has candy. He has attention. He has toys. He has his own room. We get him the things he wants within reason (we&#39;re not rich lol). Heck, each kid even has their own laptop computer that they received as a Christmas present. We all honor the laws of property in our home. If it belongs to one person, we don&#39;t use/eat it without permission. If it belongs to all, we share fairly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKim</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":297512048,"authorName":"Kim Thorvaldson","from":"Kim Thorvaldson &lt;ThreeHearts429@...&gt;","profile":"klthorvaldson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Lying :(","postDate":"1332512929","msgId":66362,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDRUQ3MTg2NThBRUVGMi0xOUI0LTgzOTdAd2VibWFpbC1kMDc2LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpraTAwaStqcm9hQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpraTAwaStqcm9hQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66361,"nextInTopic":66363,"prevInTime":66361,"nextInTime":66363,"topicId":66307,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-His sisters went to Disney and he didn t because he didn t want to, or wasn t invited, or ?? -=-And they brought home candy for themselves and not for him","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-327571847\">-=-His sisters went to Disney and he didn&#39;t because he didn&#39;t want to, or wasn&#39;t invited, or ??<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-And they brought home candy for themselves and not for him because�?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t clarify.

They brought home little bags of chocolate covered malt balls. They put the bags in the kitchen cabinet outside of curious toddler range. :) The next day, one of the bags was open and obviously missing some candy. The rightful owner of the candy was very upset. I checked with my husband to see if he had taken a few, he said no. I didn&#39;t touch them, and the baby couldn&#39;t reach.  So, we discussed the situation together, expressing concern that we were being dishonest with each other. Both girls were upset that their special treat had been eaten and were in tears. After many adamant denials, my son eventually confessed to eating about half the bag before anyone else was awake in the morning.***<br/>\n<br/>\nHis sisters went to Disney and he didn&#39;t because he didn&#39;t want to, or wasn&#39;t invited, or ??<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they brought home candy for themselves and not for him because?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to answer these questions on-list but they might be something you want to think about.  I should think that any young child, presented with sisters who went to Disney and got candy, would be feeling rather crummy and would want a piece of that for themselves.  And since he couldn&#39;t get a piece of the trip, what he was left with is getting himself some of the &quot;treats&quot; that came home.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy family went to my sister&#39;s house for Easter when my son was 5 years old.  My sister&#39;s inlaws were there.  They had bought Easter Baskets full of candy and toys for my sister&#39;s 2 children, and presented these baskets to her children in front of my son.  They gave him nothing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have never in my life given something to one child when there were other children around.  I would get no joy out of making some children happy while others looked on with nothing.  All I could think that Easter as I watched was &quot;who does that?  What kind of person is happy doing that??&quot;  We haven&#39;t gone to her house for holidays where the inlaws will be there again :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wonder  if you knew you hadn&#39;t eaten the candy, your husband hadn&#39;t, and your girls hadn&#39;t  then you knew your stepson had.  <br/>\n<br/>\nConfronting him and watching him deny it over and over and then finally admit what he had done  I&#39;m not sure what that proved?  You knew he had done it.  You could have addressed why it happened and why it wasn&#39;t ok, without needing to push him til he admitted what you already knew.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d think of that going like this - &quot;gosh I can see that you got into the girls&#39; candy and ate some.  It must have been hard to know there was candy in the house for your sisters, and none for you.

Later instead of candy, it could be money from your wallet  liquor from the liquor cabinet  things like that that start to go missing (that&#39;s what I saw happen at my house growing up).

Although i initially looked at it as lying, i now look at it as denying.  I think kids, especially those who have been through traumatic experiences react from fear without concsiousy think about it.  My son denies almost everything immediately.    For example, hes playing with my daughters markers and gets up to do something else, she comes in and says,&quot; who left thelid off my marker?&quot;. He immediately denies it.  <br/>\nThings that have helped us is not to ask questions about who did what.  If i suspect or know  he did something, for example the markers, i just call andnicely ask him if would help me clean up the markers so we can keep them nice for his sister. Usually he complies happily.  If accused and then ordered to clean them up he gets mad and resentful.<br/>\n  Try to help reduce the number of oppurtunities for him to lie.  When i do ask a question about who did something, i will often preface with assurance that im not angry just want to talk about it.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; He lies about nearly everything.

Why, at 10 (or 8) would he care  <br/>\nor understand what that means? If you are talking to him about that,  <br/>\nit&#39;s one more thing for him to feel bad and weird about. Perhaps he&#39;s  <br/>\nliving up to the expectations that have been set for him as someone  <br/>\nwith a disorder.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n He doesn&#39;t know that he has SPD. He does know that he, his sister, and I all have ADHD. He is not singled out around here, he&#39;s one of many with similar wiring. We celebrate it. When we explain it to the kids, we compare it to Apple and IBM computers - they&#39;re both computers and do the same job, it&#39;s just the way they do things that&#39;s different. Different &quot;wiring&quot;. :) It&#39;s never a &quot;disorder&quot;. Additionally, among our friends, there is at least one child in each family with similar wiring to us or is on the ASD spectrum. Again, it is celebrated and embraced by all. And all varieties of wiring are celebrated and embraced equally. The human brain is a beautiful thing. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the relationships being damaged, it&#39;s between him and his family and friends. Because he chooses to lie to all of us, his sisters and friends choose not to trust him. We sadly think twice when he says anything. It&#39;s awful and heartbreaking to see his hurt and not be able to help. I would love to be able to just let it be, but it affects him and so many other people. Please read the response I posted before this for specific examples of how it affects his family and friends. That&#39;s why I posted here for ideas of ways to help him. I&#39;m at a loss for what else to do beyond explaining the consequences of his choice each time he lies. Because that isn&#39;t working. He&#39;s just lying more often. I find it unfathomable that he might not understand that lying causes people to not trust you and is hurtful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he gets plenty of positive attention. :) We have parent/kid one-on-one dates regularly. The kids all plan family activities for us to enjoy together. I am home with them 24/7. We do all sorts of things together, including playing, board games, video games, gardening, crafts, reading, outings, cooking, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKim <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":297512048,"authorName":"Kim Thorvaldson","from":"Kim Thorvaldson &lt;ThreeHearts429@...&gt;","profile":"klthorvaldson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Lying :(","postDate":"1332507308","msgId":66352,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDRUQ3MEI0RUYxRjFEQS0xOUI0LTdCM0RAd2VibWFpbC1kMDc2LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzI0MzExMjUuNjk4NDIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjg3MzA2Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEE5RkYzMEEyLTc4RkUtNDhGNS1CMjUwLTM4OTFFODE0ODM1QkBhb2wuY29tPiA8MUVBMTAzQjQtODQ4Ny00MzgxLUE0MEEtNTg1MkRGNjQ1QzFEQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8NDM1N0ZDMjQtNzM0OC00MEUzLTg5ODAtRkU4ODk3NzlDMUZGQGFvbC5jb20+IDwxMzMyNDMxMTI1LjY5ODQyLllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWI4NzMwNi5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":66348,"nextInTopic":66353,"prevInTime":66351,"nextInTime":66353,"topicId":66307,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***If you knew it was his cup why did you ask him?

My friend&#39;s son brought a Koosh ball with him one day. When we were getting ready to leave, I noticed my son had the ball in his hands. <br/>\nI said, &quot;Honey, please go give that to your friend. He&#39;s getting ready to leave.&quot;<br/>\nHe said, &quot;He gave it to me.&quot;<br/>\nThe next time we went to the park, my friend was asking if we had seen it. Her son had been looking for it frantically because he thought he had lost it.<br/>\nI told my son what had happened, and he maintained his story even when the little boy was standing in front of him crying because he realized he had taken it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s another one.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis sisters went to Disney with their father. They brought home little bags of chocolate covered malt balls. They put the bags in the kitchen cabinet outside of curious toddler range. :) <br/>\nThe next day, one of the bags was open and obviously missing some candy. The rightful owner of the candy was very upset. I checked with my husband to see if he had taken a few, he said no. I didn&#39;t touch them, and the baby couldn&#39;t reach. <br/>\nSo, we discussed the situation together, expressing concern that we were being dishonest with each other. Both girls were upset that their special treat had been eaten and were in tears. After many adamant denials, my son eventually confessed to eating about half the bag before anyone else was awake in the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKim <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":351282822,"authorName":"Hope Nilges","from":"Hope Nilges &lt;h_nilges@...&gt;","profile":"h_nilges","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Lying :(","postDate":"1332461612","msgId":66348,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzI0NjE2MTIuNDUyMjQuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE2MTgwMS5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ4RkYxMEVCLTEzNjUtNEFFOC04RTgwLTQwNTQ5RTI1MkRCQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEE5RkYzMEEyLTc4RkUtNDhGNS1CMjUwLTM4OTFFODE0ODM1QkBhb2wuY29tPiA8MUVBMTAzQjQtODQ4Ny00MzgxLUE0MEEtNTg1MkRGNjQ1QzFEQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8NDM1N0ZDMjQtNzM0OC00MEUzLTg5ODAtRkU4ODk3NzlDMUZGQGFvbC5jb20+IDwxMzMyNDMxMTI1LjY5ODQyLllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWI4NzMwNi5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+IDwxMzMyNDMzNzUzLjQ0OTc5LllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWIxNjE4MDQubWFpbC5iZjEueWFob28uY29tPiA8NDhGRjEwRUItMTM2NS00QUU4LThFODAtNDA1NDlFMjUyREJCQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66334,"nextInTopic":66352,"prevInTime":66347,"nextInTime":66349,"topicId":66307,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"=Please use unschooling instead of RU (or use radical unschooling) here (and maybe everywhere else).

And that&#39;s just what I think lying is- a tool in a person&#39;s bag they pull from to help them cope. If lying was the behavior that was bothering me I&#39;d first examine when and why I&#39;ve been untruthful to try to gain some insights into what they *might* be thinking (might because I don&#39;t presume my reasons are theirs, this exercise just helps me put myself in their shoes as a starting point). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for lying... I know that in my own life when I&#39;ve been untruthful with people it was for a few reasons: <br/>\n-It made me feel more powerful in a situation where I actually had little power. (ie: pretending not to care when we were moving *again*)<br/>\n-I was trying to avoid unpleasant, artificial punishments.<br/>\n-I was trying to avoid unpleasant tasks.<br/>\n-I didn&#39;t want to change my parents&#39; (or other important people to me) perceptions of me. I was their good little girl and I felt a strong need (which I still have to fight at times) to please them and never alter that view. <br/>\n-I was seeking attention (fantastical stories about my experiences at my old school helped me overcome shyness about making friends at a new school).<br/>\n-I didn&#39;t think I was good enough and the fictional me was actually the ideal me.<br/>\n-Sometimes it&#39;s just easier. As I become stronger in my convictions regarding unschooling and other things I don&#39;t do this as much but there have certainly been times when I&#39;ve allowed people to think we school-at-home because I knew they wouldn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; no matter what I said.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure if you polled 100 people about why they have lied (because we ALL have lied, at some point in our lives- either outright, by omission, misleading phrasing, etc.) you&#39;d get 100 different reasons. My point is that instead of trying to fix your stepson ask yourself if there is anything about the situation that needs to change. If he feels powerless, the need to please, pressure to be perfect, etc. then those things need to change so he won&#39;t feel the need to pull lying from his coping tool bag. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Lying :(","postDate":"1332432849","msgId":66325,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFCRDg5MURFLTlBNjQtNDcxMC04NEYxLTYxM0JEMzg0MUIzQ0Bjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQzNTdGQzI0LTczNDgtNDBFMy04OTgwLUZFODg5Nzc5QzFGRkBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEE5RkYzMEEyLTc4RkUtNDhGNS1CMjUwLTM4OTFFODE0ODM1QkBhb2wuY29tPiA8MUVBMTAzQjQtODQ4Ny00MzgxLUE0MEEtNTg1MkRGNjQ1QzFEQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8NDM1N0ZDMjQtNzM0OC00MEUzLTg5ODAtRkU4ODk3NzlDMUZGQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":66324,"nextInTopic":66327,"prevInTime":66324,"nextInTime":66326,"topicId":66307,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The way you phrased it the first time, I was thinking maybe you were punishing him.  I know what it includes.  I wondered what you had been doing when he lied.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo months isn&#39;t really unschooling yet, so one good thing to do is keep moving toward unschooling and see whether the new relationships make him feel more confident and trusted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAvoid situations that will amount to entrapment. If you see that he&#39;s in the habit of lying, don&#39;t ask him the kinds of questions that have truth-or-lie answers if you can possibly help it, until you get to a different space with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said he&#39;s the oldest of your current family. Does he have older siblings elsewhere?<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when someone is identifying with another family or parent, they fill in the blanks they don&#39;t actually know with fantasies and fibs.  They create the bonds they don&#39;t actually have, perhaps, or create a strength of relationship that doesn&#39;t actually exist.  If the lies have to do with the mom or other siblings (if any) or anything about the other side of the divorce, that might be understandable.  Not ideal, but also not unusual.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-We have unschooled for two months. We are baby stepping through deschooling. We have been relaxed homeschoolers for over a year. Prior to that, he was in public school and day care. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo other things weren&#39;t going well, at school or with homeschooling.  And he was still a baby when you had the twins.  So they have another dad too, maybe.  That&#39;s a lot of people for him to deal with and process and interact with and have (or fail to have) a relationship with.  Poor guy!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s got to be hard for you and your husband, too.  Maybe for a while try to accept without a lot of shaming and pressure that what he says might not be true.  Try to keep it from hurting the girls, and try to arrange not to need to act on his reports or accounts, if you can.  If you can just let one be there, let it be.  If you count and nail him every time, he will continue to lose, as he&#39;s losing now.
