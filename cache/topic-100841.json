Don&#39;t you?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s only been out of school for 3 years and a lot of his homeschooling friends are doing the combo school/co-op thing. Its hard to be different from everyone else.  Especially if he was in school until he was 13.  Sounds like a lot of schooling still on the brain.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, maybe he isn&#39;t cut out for that time of learning.  He might become the person he&#39;s meant to be through &quot;doing&quot;. His RPG stuff is what is exciting to him right now,  maybe that will be his vocation.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday we got the Video Game Revolution DVD that people have talked about.  Its Awesome.  There are a few mainstream thoughts through it, but a lot of positive stuff.  In that DVD you can see how huge the industry is,,so maybe your son will learn all his stuff by just playing.  People do that all the time,, maybe you can bring that up to him.  Tell him its OK if all the book stuff doesn&#39;t work out.  Maybe he thought that&#39;s what he wanted at the time, but figured out that it was bogus.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n***The problem is that we are now missing all daytime activities -- both with others in the hs&#39;ing community and things we used to enjoy doing together.

(Frankly, I&#39;m getting bored.)***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with what Sandra said about still doing what you want to do.  I know it is hard when one of your family kind of breaks off into their own thing.  But I explain that we have to keep up with everyone else&#39;s interests too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a son who also is on the same schedule.  He&#39;s a lot younger so I sometimes have worries, especially when no other kids around here are like this. But you should see him,  he is so happy, so OK in his skin.  When my son is up, I try and spend some time with him.  I can&#39;t stay up til wee hours of the morning, I have a 7 yr old too who get up in the a.m.  But I try and make the most of the time we do have.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThis exact topic came up last night as we were watching the DVD.  I asked my son if he thought life was too boring, that he wanted to do video games instead of &quot;real life&quot;.  I sometimes worry about depression, stuff like that.  Some people think that he should be more involved in &quot;real life&quot;, that I&#39;m not offering him enough other stuff.  He said,, &quot;Mom,  you&#39;ve tried that. I love these video games.&quot;  And he is happy, he&#39;s fun to talk to and he says he&#39;s going to write video game walk throughs.  This is his course of study right now, he&#39;s only 11.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe your son just needs to reevalute his decision.  Tell him its OK.  Heck, better now than when he is in college.  Or maybe college won&#39;t be for him,, that&#39;s OK too. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!

We&#39;re both night owls, so a 1-2 am bedtime worked fine for us for a long time.  We&#39;d get up around 10 am or so (and could manage the occasional 9 am meeting/activity with other hs&#39;ers), and we&#39;d have plenty of good hours during the afternoon and such.  Now that Liam is 16, things have changed on two fronts, and I have a problem I can&#39;t seem to come to grips with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 6 months or so ago, Liam made a decision about what he wanted to do with himself after he turns 18.  He definitely wants to go to college, and he wants to pursue a demanding track -- probably physics or computer engineering.  He did some research and we talked a lot, and he decided that he wanted to start becoming more intentional about academic work.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s got hs&#39;ing friends who are taking dual credit community college courses, but he doesn&#39;t want to do that.  Maybe the occasional computer course for fun, or a non-credit audited course perhaps, but he steadfastly maintains that he wants to work independently for now, and experience college and grad school on the &#39;normal&#39; track -- starting with other 18 year olds.  So far, so good.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe dragged me out (not unwillingly :-) to several bookstores over several months, and we set up a rough plan together of what he wanted to cover over the next two years.  Reading and discussing college prep lit, learning to  write a college level essay, catching up on his math through calculus, teaching himself basic physics, filling in his gaps in history.  I worried that he was feeling that the only way he could &#39;learn&#39; was to do it in school-fashion, and we talked about that a lot.  Rather than getting curricular materials, he chose living books in the areas in which he was interested.  We planned on renting lots of videos -- historical movies as well as documentaries.  I mentioned a civil war battlefields trip here a while back.  He enjoys picking up historical novels as well, and non-fiction books on the lives and work of well known scientists and the like.  You get the idea, I think.  He just wants to be more intentional, and I support him in that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does this have to do with sleep problems, you&#39;re probably asking by now.  Well, that&#39;s the second thing that has changed recently, and at exactly the same time.  I&#39;m convinced it has to be related somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis sleep pattern has changed dramatically.  He now stays up until 5, 6, or even 7 am most nights, and sleeps until at least 3 pm, and even though he asks me to wake him at an earlier hour, I virtually have to drag him out of bed then.  It took me two hours to get him up today, and that was after his alarm rang for over an hour unanswered.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s groggy when he wakes up, and spends several hours on the computer, just puttering around.  (That, in itself, doesn&#39;t bother me.  He&#39;s playing an online text-based rpg where he has earned an administrator position, and he&#39;s getting a lot out of it.  Besides, we all need adjustment time in ur &#39;mornings.&#39;)  The problem is that we are now missing all daytime activities -- both with others in the hs&#39;ing community and things we used to enjoy doing together.  Mo more museum trips or outings.  Or very few.  No more cruising Asian antique shops or Aboriginal art galleries.  (Frankly, I&#39;m getting bored.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, he has no desire to follow though on any of the things he was so interested in a few months ago.  Books go unread.  Movies are returned unwatched.  What he does remain interested in, he doesn&#39;t feel like doing until after midnight.  Then, he&#39;s hot and ready to go, full of ideas, and I&#39;m ready to flake out.  Then, he says he doesn&#39;t want to do any of those things without me, and they remain untouched.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am totally confused by these hot and cold messages he&#39;s sending.  I&#39;ve considered several things, and will give you more of my thinking on each of them if you&#39;re interested.  Hormonal changes.  Depression.  Internal confusion about how to go about pursuing his goals/a lack of true motivation/leftover negative messages from his school years...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, though, that this initial post has gone on long enough.
