This night&#39;s call was no<br/>\n&gt;  different. Jerking up to the ringing summons, I focused on<br/>\n&gt;  the red illuminated numbers of my clock. Midnight.<br/>\n&gt;  Panicky thoughts filled my sleep-dazed mind as I grabbed<br/>\n&gt;  the receiver.<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;Hello?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  My heart pounded, I gripped the phone tighter and eyed<br/>\n&gt;  my husband, who was now turning to face my side of the bed.<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;Mama?&quot; I could hardly hear the whisper over the<br/>\n&gt;  static. But my thoughts immediately went to my daughter.<br/>\n&gt;  When the desperate sound of a young crying voice became<br/>\n&gt;  clearer on the line, I grabbed for my husband and squeezed<br/>\n&gt;  his wrist.<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;Mama, I know it&#39;s late. But don&#39;t...don&#39;t say<br/>\n&gt;  anything, until I finish. And before you ask, yes, I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;  been drinking. I nearly ran off the road a few miles back<br/>\n&gt;  and...&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  I drew in a sharp shallow breath, released my husband<br/>\n&gt;  and pressed my hand against my forehead. Sleep still<br/>\n&gt;  fogged my mind, and I attempted to fight back the panic.<br/>\n&gt;  Something wasn&#39;t right.<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;And I got so scared. All I could think about was how<br/>\n&gt;  it would hurt you if a policeman came to your door and said<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;d been killed. I want...to come home. I know running<br/>\n&gt;  away was wrong. I know you&#39;ve been worried sick. I should<br/>\n&gt;  have called you days ago, but I was afraid...afraid...&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  Sobs of deep-felt emotion flowed from the receiver and<br/>\n&gt;  poured into my heart. Immediately I pictured my daughter&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;  face in my mind and my fogged senses seemed to clear. &quot;I<br/>\n&gt;  think -&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;No! Please let me finish! Please!&quot; She pleaded,<br/>\n&gt;  not so much in anger, but in desperation.<br/>\n&gt;  I paused and tried to think what to say. Before I<br/>\n&gt;  could go on, she continued. &quot;I&#39;m pregnant, Mama. I know I<br/>\n&gt;  shouldn&#39;t be drinking now...especially now, but I&#39;m scared,<br/>\n&gt;  Mama. So scared!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  The voice broke again, and I bit into my lip, feeling<br/>\n&gt;  my own eyes fill with moisture. I looked at my husband who<br/>\n&gt;  sat silently mouthing, &quot;Who is it?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  I shook my head and when I didn&#39;t answer, he jumped up<br/>\n&gt;  and left the room, returning seconds later with the<br/>\n&gt;  portable phone held to his ear.<br/>\n&gt;  She must have heard the click on the line because she<br/>\n&gt;  continued, &quot;Are you still there? Please don&#39;t hang up on<br/>\n&gt;  me! I need you. I feel so alone.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  I clutched the phone and stared at my husband, seeking<br/>\n&gt;  guidance. &quot;I&#39;m here, I wouldn&#39;t hang up,&quot; I said.<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;I should have told you, Mama. I know I should have<br/>\n&gt;  told you. But when we talk, you just keep telling me what<br/>\n&gt;  I should do. You read all those pamphlets on how to talk<br/>\n&gt;  about sex and all, but all you do is talk. You don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;  listen to me. You never let me tell you how I feel. It is<br/>\n&gt;  as if my feelings aren&#39;t important. Because you&#39;re my<br/>\n&gt;  mother you think you have all the answers. But sometimes I<br/>\n&gt;  don&#39;t need answers. I just want someone to listen.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  I swallowed the lump in my throat and stared at the<br/>\n&gt;  how-to-talk-to-your-kids pamphlets scattered on my<br/>\n&gt;  nightstand. &quot;I&#39;m listening,&quot; I whispered.<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;You know, back there on the road, after I got the car<br/>\n&gt;  under control, I started thinking about the baby and taking<br/>\n&gt;  care of it. Then I saw this phone booth, and it was as if<br/>\n&gt;  I could hear you preaching about how people shouldn&#39;t drink<br/>\n&gt;  and drive. So I called a taxi. I want to come home.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;That&#39;s good, Honey,&quot; I said, relief filling my chest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  My husband came closer, sat down beside me and laced his<br/>\n&gt;  fingers through mine. I knew from his touch that he<br/>\n&gt;  thought I was doing and saying the right thing.<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;But you know, I think I can drive now.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;No!&quot; I snapped. My muscles stiffened, and I<br/>\n&gt;  tightened the clasp on my husband&#39;s hand. &quot;Please, wait<br/>\n&gt;  for the taxi. Don&#39;t hang up on me until the taxi gets<br/>\n&gt;  there.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;I just want to come home, Mama.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;I know. But do this for your mama. Wait for the<br/>\n&gt;  taxi, please.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  I listened to the silence in fear. When I didn&#39;t hear<br/>\n&gt;  her answer, I bit into my lip and closed my eyes. Somehow<br/>\n&gt;  I had to stop her from driving.<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;There&#39;s the taxi, now.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  Only when I heard someone in the background asking<br/>\n&gt;  about a Yellow Cab did I feel my tension easing.<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;I&#39;m coming home, Mama.&quot; There was a click, and the<br/>\n&gt;  phone went silent.<br/>\n&gt;  Moving from the bed, tears forming in my eyes, I<br/>\n&gt;  walked out into the hall and went to stand in my sixteen-<br/>\n&gt;  year-old daughter&#39;s room. The dark silence hung thick. My<br/>\n&gt;  husband came from behind, wrapped his arms around me and<br/>\n&gt;  rested his chin on the top of my head.<br/>\n&gt;  I wiped the tears from my cheeks. &quot;We have to learn<br/>\n&gt;  to listen,&quot; I said to him.<br/>\n&gt;  He pulled me around to face him. &quot;We&#39;ll learn.<br/>\n&gt;  You&#39;ll see.&quot; Then he took me into his arms, and I buried<br/>\n&gt;  my head in his shoulder.<br/>\n&gt;  I let him hold me for several moments, then I pulled<br/>\n&gt;  back and stared back at the bed. He studied me for a<br/>\n&gt;  second, then asked, &quot;Do you think she&#39;ll ever know she<br/>\n&gt;  dialed the wrong number?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  I looked at our sleeping daughter, then back at him.<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;Maybe it wasn&#39;t such a wrong number.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;Mom, Dad, what are you doing?&quot; The muffled young<br/>\n&gt;  voice came from under the covers.<br/>\n&gt;  I walked over to my daughter, who now sat up staring<br/>\n&gt;  into darkness. &quot;We&#39;re practicing,&quot; I answered.<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;Practicing what?&quot; she mumbled and laid back on the<br/>\n&gt;  mattress, her eyes already closed in slumber.<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;Listening,&quot; I whispered and brushed a hand over her<br/>\n&gt;  cheek. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1694471,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","profile":"anoydami","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Fw: the phone call","postDate":"1013208565","msgId":31957,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxZjkwMWMxYjBmNSRlZjI3NzBhMCQyZDVkZDFkMUBjb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31959,"prevInTime":31956,"nextInTime":31958,"topicId":31957,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"For all the moms and dads out there.
