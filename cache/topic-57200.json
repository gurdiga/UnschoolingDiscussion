Not sure it will sound very professional.<br/>\n&gt; He will definitely have another business line and we would be putting the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;office&quot; in our bedroom. That&#39;s really the only place for it. The<br/>\n&gt; office/library/computer room is all open and not an option. We really have<br/>\n&gt; no other room on our house. The bedroom is plenty big enough for it. We<br/>\n&gt; would just have to take out the couch that&#39;s in there now. Thing is, our<br/>\n&gt; bedroom is right by the playroom and other bathroom and at the end of the<br/>\n&gt; hall.
