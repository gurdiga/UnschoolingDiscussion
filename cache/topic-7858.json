So, even when nursing, they are<br/>\nstarving their babies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said in a private post to Kim, I feel great that I will be even<br/>\nexpressing milk for the next baby! That is a big YES! My dh will be able to<br/>\nrelish in those precious bonding moments where he can feed baby too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that since this is  a hot topic, that I will go back into a lurk<br/>\nmode. It is every person&#39;s choice to breast/bottle feed, and I think that<br/>\nsince I would have died if I continued nursing 2 times (I was hemorrhaging<br/>\nto death), I have a right to NOT nurse in that fear alone. I know that<br/>\nBREAST MILK is very important for a baby, but since my dd was so ill and<br/>\nended up on Nutramigen, I question if I would have been able to nurse her at<br/>\nall. The ex kept it from being an option, but I do wonder...<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all for you opinions, for they do show how determined you all are<br/>\nabout your feelings. This is truly a good example of how we are all<br/>\nunschoolers, we are all different.<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7857,"nextTopicId":7831}}
