(....anyway it&#39;s white and came <br/>\nfrom Safeway) straight-sided casserole dish. It&#39;s become wedged in the glass <br/>\nbowl from my newly-acquired, but already non-functional mixer. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe casserole dish has slipped slightly, so that it&#39;s at a very slight angle <br/>\nand, try as we might, we can&#39;t extricate it. We&#39;ve tried putting the miser <br/>\nbowl in hot water and filling the casserole dish with very cold water. That&#39; <br/>\ndidn&#39;t work. I tried pushing a very thin bladed knife down between the two <br/>\nbowls. It took ages even to find a place where I could get it between them, <br/>\nand even then it didn&#39;t work. I also tried squirting dishwasher soap along <br/>\nthe rims, in the hope that some might filter through the gap and provide <br/>\nlubrication, but that didn&#39;t work either. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs there one of those clever trick methods for separating jammed breakables? <br/>\nIn the same vein as the one for getting rings off fingers?  Or can anyone <br/>\nthink of another way of separating them, please, short of taking a hammer to <br/>\none of the two? All suggestions would be most gratefully received!<br/>\n<br/>\nMattie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11963,"nextTopicId":11965}}
