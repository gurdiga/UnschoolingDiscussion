My younger was recently given a battery of standardized tests (he is now in college) so that he could have the magic paper  allowing him to use a keyboard instead of handwriting for ANY class.   For what it is worth, standardized tests have usually ranked his reading comprehension extremely high.  The M. Ed.  testing him thought he needed all sorts of remedial phonics work since he had difficulty  on the subtest for &quot;decoding nonsense words&quot;.  Yes, let me try to make this clear.   He reads English fluently....both silently and aloud.<br/>\nHe has an impressive vocabulary and usually has the &quot;correct&quot;  pronunciation for any unfamiliar words he might encounter in text.  But because he can not sound out what someone else would consider the proper pronunciation for a string of letters that do not form any word known to English speakers,  he is supposed to undergo intensive remediation.   I think some followers of the phonics cult have it backward.   Phonics should be one or many tools that might be tried to make reading easier.  Supposed to be the means to an end............not the end itself!<br/>\n<br/>\nI firmly believe that many of the 8-12 year olds with &quot;severe problems with reading&quot;  would probably BE reading well if there had not been such intensive intervention at ages 5-7!!  Or even younger it seems nowadays. <br/>\n<br/>\nI  DO recognize it is hard NOT to be worried.   My older son (who intermittently attended out of home private schools and occasionally took standardized tests)  went from basically being a non-reader at age 9  to reading at what the standardized test ranked as &quot;college freshman&quot;  at age 10.   Despite my recognizing that the older one was reading fluently,   I still was sometimes uncomfortable when the younger one turned 6 and 7 and 8 and was &quot;still&quot; not reading.  <br/>\nHard to &quot;keep the faith&quot; even when evidence is before your eyes. <br/>\nBy age 10, HE was sometimes upset although I would try to assure him that he could read more than he was giving himself credit for and that the day would come when it would be easier.  In the meantime, it was sensible to utilize his strengths (such as an incredible memory)  in getting on with exploring life. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t really remember  exactly when he started reading &quot;full-length&quot; &quot;adult&quot; books in addition to manuals and magazines and &quot;trivia&quot; books but it was definitely in his teens. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, he does have some processing difficulties...... the kind that give him a &quot;professionally diagnosed reading  disability&quot; even at age 18.  However,  he has pretty well worked out his own means of compensating.    Watching his peers over the years (many who had reading tutors at age 7),   I figure that had we bought into &quot;early intervention&quot; , it is possible he would be truly handicapped by an inability to read for himself.  Instead, he reads for pleasure AND is able to read whatever he wants.   His reading speed might not be optimum (his silent reading not terribly faster than vocalized reading) but he does NOT find reading to be  unpleasant or a duty.  And no, at present we are not doing any &quot;treatment&quot; for the diagnosed disabilities.     <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was important that I not only avoided &quot;therapies&quot; and &quot;remediation&quot; but that I was consistent in assuring him that he &quot;would&quot;  be able to read.  That if he wasn&#39;t reading yet, it was because it was not yet time for him to.   And that when it WAS time, it would not be so difficult. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nvicki<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"&quot;Tia Leschke&quot; &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Kids With LDs and Unschooling","postDate":"1033512603","msgId":45024,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwN2YwMWMyNjlhNyQwOTUzM2M2MCQzNDdhNjZjZkBlYnVzNDk+","referencesHeader":"PDNEOTI5NkFELjczQ0IxNDNGQGFyY3ppcC5jb20+IDwwMDQzMDFjMjY1NTUkOTVlNzYyYjAkMGU4OTUyNDNAQW5vbGlja0ZhbWlseT4="},"prevInTopic":44956,"nextInTopic":54166,"prevInTime":45023,"nextInTime":45025,"topicId":44644,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... transperancy over the writing to help a child read.

This meant that my<br/>\nexperience of school was miserable. However having run a Home education<br/>\nwebsite in the UK for more than two years I have come to the conclusion<br/>\nthat for many children even when they are diagnosed and provided with<br/>\nspecial help it is still a difficult time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiterally - Dyslexia means word blindness. Its not just a reluctance to<br/>\nlearn to read and or write it has within it a number of specific<br/>\ndifficulties characteristic of Dyslexia as well as some characteristics<br/>\nwhich may be regarded as beneficial. for example Dyslexics tend to have<br/>\nhigher than average IQ and significantly better spatial awareness. In<br/>\nthe mid 1980&#39;s it was noted that nine out of ten of the worlds highest<br/>\npaid architects were profoundly Dyslexic. The man who produced the<br/>\nmotherboard for the first Apple Mac was dyslexic a remarkably high<br/>\nproportion of Nobel Laureates are dyslexic. It has even been argued that<br/>\nEinstein, Leonardo De Vincy  and Shakespeare were dyslexic. Shakespeare<br/>\nrarely even used the same spelling of his name twice.<br/>\n<br/>\nDyslexia manifests itself in different ways. Some children find reading<br/>\ndifficult others find spelling impossible, yet others will find both<br/>\ndifficult. Generally my reading was good but my spelling was very poor.<br/>\nUnder pressure however my ability to read accurately declined. This<br/>\nmeant that under exam conditions I would frequently mis-read the<br/>\nquestions I was being asked - thus my answers were wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile there are some who believe that dyslexia is a product of poor<br/>\nteaching there are others who believe that it is physiological. It has<br/>\nbeen known since the mid 1970&#39;s that the brains of Dyslexics are<br/>\nstructured differently to those of non-dyslexics. This could however be<br/>\nan effect rather than a cause as the brain is dynamic - it changes its<br/>\nstructure depending upon the environment it finds itself in - so as far<br/>\nas I understand it the jury is out.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way dyslexia presents real problems for which there are specific<br/>\nteaching methods which can be used to help solve them. Parents of<br/>\nDyslexic children need to know what they are as I understand that some<br/>\nare very effective - there are some good mailing lists in the internet<br/>\nwhere these are discussed (there is a good group run by the UK home<br/>\neducation community).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe self esteem of Dyslexic children is often low and needs a boost.<br/>\nParents can help by finding an activity in which s/he excels. Encourage<br/>\nyour child to be in situations where s/he can gain peer status. I used<br/>\nto do First aid up to competition level and was captain of a successful<br/>\nteam and loved it - no writing was involved and it was a useful skill -<br/>\nit put me top of the year at school for anatomy. By the age of 15 I<br/>\nprobably know more anatomy than any pupil the school had ever had and<br/>\ngave the science teacher who had a remarkably low opinion of me quite a<br/>\nsurprise when I know the Latin names of nearly all 206 bones of the body<br/>\n:). For my English verbal test at the age of sixteen I chose the subject<br/>\nof the Lymph nodes.<br/>\n<br/>\nUse computers with spell checking facilities and grammar checking. A<br/>\nfull copy of Outlook perhaps where the email facility uses Word to write<br/>\nthe emails, thus spell grammar checking and occurs as it does in word -<br/>\nwhile you are actually typing the email - this assists the child to<br/>\nanalyse their mistakes as they write them and gives them confidence to<br/>\nactually write remember Latter and Later are both correct spellings of<br/>\nwords but the dyslexic child will not know which is which so a grammar<br/>\nchecker is essential. It is also common for example for dyslexics find<br/>\nalternative words to those they find difficult - this makes written work<br/>\nlook idiosyncratic at best - a word I came to loath at school (Michael<br/>\nhas an idiosyncratic way of expressing himself...) to be fair on re<br/>\nreading my work my sentences were so convoluted it looked like a poor<br/>\nattempt to copy the style of Charles Dickens.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen s/he does write anything you must approach the subject separately<br/>\nto the way he express&#39;s himself. There is nothing worse for a Dyslexic<br/>\nchild to write a great story than to find that the parent concentrates<br/>\non the mis-spellings and ignores his creative effort - s/he will soon<br/>\nstop writing altogether if the result is ridiculed and there is no<br/>\nreward for doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember using a PC is very useful but since typing uses a different<br/>\npart of the brain to writing with pen and paper it means that one may<br/>\nlearn a spelling on a PC but still have difficulties on paper. In my<br/>\nprofessional life no one ever ever sees anything I write by hand - even<br/>\nmemos.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not send a child with dyslexia to a state school for a couple of<br/>\nreasons. Firstly children in school can be very cruel - he will appear<br/>\nto be stupid to them and will be constantly pointed out either by<br/>\ninsensitive teaching staff of by his separate teaching regime - he is<br/>\ntherefore likely to be bullied and treated as stupid by the other<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe will probably be grouped together with children with other learning<br/>\ndifficulties - this fails to recognise his real intelligence and<br/>\nabilities to learn. He will become bored and frustrated. He may even<br/>\nbecome disruptive and difficult to teach. Schools rarely recognise this<br/>\nchain of events and will probably believe that he is ADHD or some such<br/>\npseudo scientific label. Schools rarely have the staff with enough<br/>\ntraining to be able to provide a sufficiently high quality of help. And<br/>\nits remarkable how many teachers are totally ignorant of Dyslexia. Even<br/>\nat University I was consistently marked down by a Politics lecturer who<br/>\ninsisted that I was just careless - this after a half dozen re-writes,<br/>\nwith fresh mistakes each time. Without the computer I bought in my<br/>\nsecond year at incredible cost in those days - I would not have been<br/>\nable to complete my degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nUse visual teaching methods, pictures and experiential learning methods<br/>\nfor example; film media is probably one of the best. I used to watch TV<br/>\ndocumentaries - I was practically addicted to them. I&#39;d say that most of<br/>\nmy early education was gained from the BBC.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbove all don&#39;t pressure him into reading or writing - it won&#39;t work, he<br/>\nwill come around to it eventually. He will come to realise that he needs<br/>\nit for daily functionality. Encourage him when he shows an interest. And<br/>\npraise his efforts.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving Dyslexia does not mean that your child is doomed to go through<br/>\nlife unable to spell or read. It normally improves over time. As time<br/>\ngoes by your child will develop strategies for dealing with certain<br/>\nproblems. Technology today is a terrific boon. Personally I&#39;d recommend<br/>\nmarrying someone who is a walking dictionary.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Wishes<br/>\nMike FW<br/>\nyour man in the hammock<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.home-education.org.uk<br/>\nmike@...<br/>\nhttp://www.learning-unlimited.org&lt;&lt;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":53054552,"authorName":"mabeitzel","from":"&quot;mabeitzel&quot; &lt;mabeitzel@...&gt;","profile":"mabeitzel","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Kids With LDs and Unschooling","postDate":"1033355863","msgId":44842,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFuOGZvbitxZmFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNEOTdCM0ExLjUwOUQxOUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":44838,"nextInTopic":44956,"prevInTime":44841,"nextInTime":44843,"topicId":44644,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes, Dr. Levine has written several, one being All Kinds of Minds and a newer one that I am blanking on.

This is part of all kinds of minds program under Dr. <br/>\nMel Levine.  I have the book &quot;All Kinds of Minds.&quot;  I also have a <br/>\nfew of the tapes i.e. self-esteem.  The assessment they did was <br/>\nextremely helpful in that it came at a time when I was needing help <br/>\ndesparately.  The school psy. had just told me our son would need to <br/>\ncarry either learning disabled or mentally disabled.  I was assured <br/>\nby the center that our son was in NO way mentally disabled.  They <br/>\nwere able to highlight his strengths and they never used labels.  <br/>\nThey were all very nice and genuinely concerned.  The only part I <br/>\nwas not too keen on was the fact that the med.doctor did recommend <br/>\nmedication, but he did so respectively.  I thought it strange when <br/>\nhe said, &quot;it was recommended that our own child be medicated, but we <br/>\nchose not to.&quot;  Nevertheless, he respected my decision to not go <br/>\nthat route.  One other thing...the report suggested that the teacher <br/>\ntalk to the children in the class about how my son learns <br/>\ndifferently while he was not in the classroom.  I&#39;m don&#39;t think I <br/>\nlike that idea...it seems it would really set him apart and kids can <br/>\nbe terribly cruel.  To his teacher&#39;s credit at the time, she felt <br/>\nthe same and did not do it.  Their learning specialist came out to <br/>\nmy son&#39;s school and talked with his spec. needs team and teacher <br/>\nabout things they could do and how to approach his learning.  His <br/>\nteacher at the time was already doing most of it.  I find now as I <br/>\nlook over the report (in giving it to the school here) that some of <br/>\nthe tactics I am sure a school the size of the one here would laugh <br/>\nat.  Just because it would be near to impossible to enforce them.  <br/>\nHere they group the spec. needs kids together in one classroom with <br/>\na few reg. ed kids.  The big problem that presented for us is that <br/>\nmany of the children he was in class with had major behavior issues <br/>\n(wonder why?) and he was showing an attitude he had NEVER shown <br/>\nbefore.  He was dealing with a lot more aggressive, mean behavior <br/>\nand comments.  Anyway, Dr. Levine&#39;s program helped me to understand <br/>\nbetter how my son perceives things and processes things.  It gave me <br/>\na confidence that I greatly needed.  I met with the principal of his <br/>\nschool (there not here)prior to the year starting and she said to <br/>\nme, never having met my son, &quot;Just be prepared that he is going to <br/>\nhave to repeat 2nd grade and then I am not sure THAT will even be <br/>\nenough.&quot;  Just makes me feel warm and fuzzy all over!

I&#39;m writing in<br/>\nsupport of his response and because I think your topic is such an<br/>\nimportant one (hey, it&#39;s motivated me to actually say something to the<br/>\nlist for the first time in a while).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere at PSCS in Seattle we have tended to attract a lot of young people<br/>\nwho have been classified in other settings as &quot;dyslexic&quot; (btw, we<br/>\nabsolutely stay away from labels when talking about our students).  In<br/>\nsome cases the right approach has been to back off and let them find their<br/>\nway, believing that the pressure put on them in these other settings is<br/>\nthe root of the problem.  But this &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach, which<br/>\nseems to be what is being suggested on the other mailing list, is not<br/>\nalways right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t repeat the list of other causes and contributing factors that<br/>\nChris mentioned (see below), but I will say what he said about trying to<br/>\nfind the best way to teach each child.  Me, my educational background is<br/>\nin Special Ed (a misnomer if ever there was one).  As an ungrad at The<br/>\nEvergreen State College I did extensive research into &quot;special education&quot;<br/>\nacross cultures and, not surprisingly, discovered how much more prevalent<br/>\nlearning problems are now than in the past.  There are certainly a lot of<br/>\ntheories as to why this is, but that is not relevant here.  The personal<br/>\nresult of my research left me believing that our current system is<br/>\nbasically backwards and horribly disrespectful (not too groundbreaking for<br/>\npeople on this list, obviously).  It nearly took me in another<br/>\nprofessional direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past year, having shied away from what I saw as &quot;canned approaches&quot;<br/>\nto addressing children with learning differences since college, I started<br/>\nstudying the work of Mel Levine and his colleagues.  I am very impressed<br/>\nwith what they are doing, especially after having attended their &quot;Schools<br/>\nAttuned&quot; training in Palo Alto in June.  Certainly, their focus is on the<br/>\nmainstream school systems but many of their applications fit well for<br/>\nthose of us working in free schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, the Levine approach takes a neurodevelopmental perspective to<br/>\naddressing students with learning differences, believing that every<br/>\nperson&#39;s brain is uniquely &quot;wired.&quot;  A profile of the child is developed<br/>\nbased on input from the child, the child&#39;s parents, and teachers.  From<br/>\nthat profile, the child&#39;s strengths and weaknesses are highlighted.<br/>\nHelpful accommodations (things the school should do to assist the child)<br/>\nare suggested and specific interventions (strategies designed to help the<br/>\nchild) are offered.  The child is involved in the most respectful and<br/>\nhonoring way every step of the process.  Strengths are emphasized.<br/>\nLabels are avoided.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy simplistic explanation does not give the concept justice and,<br/>\ncertainly, parents and educators should adapt things to fit their needs<br/>\nand settings.  And I recognize that such an approach may run counter to<br/>\nhow most people in the free/alternative school world think.

Here at the Albany Free School we don&#39;t sweat<br/>\n&gt; it if a ten year old isn&#39;t reading fluently yet. But we do ask why<br/>\n&gt; not. Of course the first question is does the child have his or her<br/>\n&gt; own reasons for wanting to learn? If he or she does, then the next<br/>\n&gt; question is, is there something blocking the learning? Is the child<br/>\n&gt; too anxious, too riled up, too distractible? Or has someone turned<br/>\n&gt; reading into an onerous chore? There are more possiblities of course,<br/>\n&gt; depending on the child, but this gives you an idea of our thinking.<br/>\n&gt; Then if a child is intent on learning to read but it isn&#39;t coming<br/>\n&gt; easily -- which is usually the case because kids whose brains are<br/>\n&gt; naturally attuned to reading learn to read almost automatically --<br/>\n&gt; then we figure out the best way to teach that particular child (there<br/>\n&gt; are an infinite number of ways to do it), making sure of course that<br/>\n&gt; it is a freely chosen, pleasurable, successful, unhurried experience.<br/>\n&gt; Two things we never do: We don&#39;t say the child has a reading problem,<br/>\n&gt; and we don&#39;t take the child&#39;s process away from him or her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So here, it&#39;s of little concern to us when a child learns to read.

Regards,<br/>\nLiz<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Just some thoughts<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am Dyslexic, for me it was only diagnosed when I approached a doctor<br/>\nfor help as a mature student reading for my Degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiterally - Dyslexia means word blindness. Its not just a reluctance to<br/>\nlearn to read and or write it has within it a number of specific<br/>\ndifficulties which are characteristic of Dyslexia as well as some<br/>\ncharacteristics which may be regarded as beneficial (for example in the<br/>\nmid 1980&#39;s it was noted that 9 out of ten of the worlds highest paid<br/>\narchitects were profoundly Dyslexic. The man who produced the<br/>\nmotherboard for the first Apple Mac was dyslexic) a remarkably high<br/>\nproportion of Nobel Laureates are dyslexic.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile there are some who believe that it is a product of poor teaching<br/>\nthere are others who believe that it is physiological. It is certainly<br/>\ntrue that the brains of Dyslexics are structured differently to those of<br/>\nnon-dyslexics - this has been known to be the case since the mid 1970&#39;s.<br/>\nThis could however be an effect rather than a cause as the brain is<br/>\ndynamic - it changes its structure depending upon the environment it<br/>\nfinds itself in - so as far as I understand it the jury is out.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way dyslexia presents real problems for which there are specific<br/>\nmethods which can be used to help solve them. There are some specific<br/>\nteaching methods for this problem - you need to know what they are -<br/>\nsome are very effective - there are some good mailing lists in the<br/>\ninternet where these are discussed (there is a good group run by the UK<br/>\nhome education community)<br/>\n<br/>\nHis self esteem is probably low and needs a boost, find an activity in<br/>\nwhich he excels. Encourage him to be in situations where he can gain<br/>\npeer status. I used to do First aid up to competition level and was team<br/>\ncaptain and loved it - no writing involved and a useful skill. In the UK<br/>\nwe have Red Cross and St. Johns organisations who do this for example -<br/>\nit also put me top of the year at school for anatomy by the age of 15 I<br/>\nprobably know more anatomy than any pupil the school had ever had and<br/>\ngave the science teacher who had a remarkably low opinion of me quite a<br/>\nsurprise when I know the Latin names of nearly all 206 bones of the body<br/>\n:).<br/>\n<br/>\nUse computers with spell checking facilities - get a full copy of<br/>\nOutlook perhaps where the email facility uses Word to write the emails,<br/>\nthus spell checking occurs as it does in word - while you are actually<br/>\ntyping the email - this assists the child to analyse their mistakes as<br/>\nthey write them and gives them confidence to actually write. Remember<br/>\nthat when he does write anything you must approach the subject<br/>\nseparately to the way he express&#39;s himself. It is common for example for<br/>\ndyslexics find alternative words to those they find difficult - this<br/>\nmakes written work look idiosyncratic at best - a word I came to loath<br/>\nat school (Michael has an idiosyncratic way of expressing himself...) to<br/>\nbe fair on re reading my work my sentences were so convoluted it looked<br/>\nlike a poor attempt to copy the style of Charles Dickens.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember using a PC is very useful but since typing uses a different<br/>\npart of the brain to writing with pen and paper it means that one may<br/>\nlearn a spelling on a PC but still have difficulties on paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not send a child with dyslexia to a state school for a couple of<br/>\nreasons. Firstly children in school can be very cruel - he will appear<br/>\nto be stupid to them and will be constantly pointed out either by<br/>\ninsensitive teaching staff of by his separate teaching regime - he is<br/>\ntherefore likely to be bullied and treated as stupid by the other<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe will probably be grouped together with children with other learning<br/>\ndifficulties - this fails to recognise his real intelligence and<br/>\nabilities to learn. He will become bored and frustrated. He may even<br/>\nbecome disruptive and difficult to teach. Schools rarely recognise this<br/>\nchain of events and will probably believe that he is ADHD or some such<br/>\npseudo scientific label. Schools rarely have the staff with enough<br/>\ntraining to be able to provide a sufficiently high quality of help. And<br/>\nits remarkable how many teachers are totally ignorant of Dyslexia.<br/>\n<br/>\nUse visual teaching methods pictures and experiential learning methods<br/>\nfor example, film media is probably one of the best. I used to watch TV<br/>\ndocumentaries - I was practically addicted to them. I&#39;d say that most of<br/>\nmy early education was gained from the BBC.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbove all don&#39;t pressure him into reading or writing - it won&#39;t work, he<br/>\nwill come around to it eventually. He will come to realise that he needs<br/>\nit for daily functionality. Encourage him when he shows an interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Wishes<br/>\nMike FW<br/>\nyour man in the hammock<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.home-education.org.uk<br/>\nmike@...<br/>\nhttp://www.learning-unlimited.org&lt;&lt;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59191389,"authorName":"Deb K.","from":"&quot;Deb K.&quot; &lt;debra@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: Kids With LDs and Unschooling","postDate":"1033131143","msgId":44699,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGQwMWMyNjYyNCRiOWQyMDVjMCQ1MzI1ZThjZEBwYXZpbGlvbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwMzMwOTg4MjEuMzMxNi4yODQxMy5tMUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":44694,"nextInTopic":44808,"prevInTime":44698,"nextInTime":44700,"topicId":44644,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve decided there is nothing so magical about what the professionals do.

Don&#39;t be intimidated by them.  My oldest son is 17 now, reads with no<br/>\nproblems, makes movies, writes scripts, etc., but it wasn&#39;t always like<br/>\nthat.  At 10 years old he was severely struggling, at that time I was<br/>\nconvinced that he was dyslexic.  (His dad is dyslexic.)  He didn&#39;t get<br/>\nanywhere with reading and spelling until I backed off and let him read only<br/>\nthings of interest to him - comic books, video game guides, etc.!  He also<br/>\ndiscovered when editing his own books recently that his spelling had<br/>\nimproved dramatically over the course of about two years.<br/>\n  Now, it is happening with my younger son, 11 years old.  I am positive<br/>\nthat if I had him tested the results would only take away his confidence<br/>\n(and mine).<br/>\n  Even my husband - after putting public school many years behind him - has<br/>\nimproved (in his reading and spelling skills).  There was a time when I<br/>\nNEVER saw him read.  Now he currently has three books going at a time!<br/>\n  My suggestion is to not look at that report when it comes.  Lock the<br/>\nresults away or burn them!  The &quot;professionals&quot; don&#39;t know your son.  He is<br/>\nso lucky to be at home with you and not in the &quot;system&quot;.<br/>\n                                                                 Deb K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n...My ds is 10 and we&#39;ve always homeschooled.<br/>\n   Last<br/>\n  week I had him tested for LDs.

I knew<br/>\n  what it would be but for some reason having<br/>\n  someone else tell me put me into a tailspin.

But I wanted to<br/>\nlet you know a couple things. First, the *testing* he went through is not<br/>\nthe end all be all. It is a snapshot in time with many variables involved.<br/>\nIs there really such a thing as &quot;1st grade reading&quot;? My oldest (10 years<br/>\nold) has developmental delays and was in public school for a few years. He<br/>\nwas constantly tested and we always treated that information as just another<br/>\ntidbit to add to the other tidbits of information to gain knowledge on how<br/>\nhe learns.<br/>\nSecond, your ds is the same person to day as he was the time before the<br/>\ntests. Sometimes I would let a particular test or report get to me. I found<br/>\nmyself responding to my son a little differently. It was like I was viewing<br/>\nhim in a different light. Boy did he pick up on that. I was pressuring him<br/>\nto work harder...learn more. He was pushing back and just wanted me to quit.<br/>\nSoon he would &quot;shut down&quot;.  He began to think that I thought there was<br/>\nsomething wrong with him.<br/>\nNow that he is home the only learning clock he is on is his own. We are<br/>\nstill working together to gain his confidence and love of learning back.<br/>\nBut he is so happy. Which brings me to my last thought. Don&#39;t let the<br/>\nspecial ed folks interfere at all. You are a very smart, intuitive mom who<br/>\nloves her son. Just relax and let him shine his own light.<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nCathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Julie Woolfolk [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jwoolfolk@...\">jwoolfolk@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, September 25, 2002 10:10 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Kids With LDs and Unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi all<br/>\n  This post is so hard to write, I&#39;m not even sure<br/>\n  if it will come out sounding right.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My ds is 10 and we&#39;ve always homeschooled. Last<br/>\n  week I had him tested for LDs. The results came<br/>\n  back as severely learning disabled (I really don&#39;t<br/>\n  have the particulars yet, I&#39;m waiting for the<br/>\n  report).1st grade reading/ 2nd grade math. I knew<br/>\n  what it would be but for some reason having<br/>\n  someone else tell me put me into a tailspin. Maybe<br/>\n  it was their insistence that only a &quot;special<br/>\n  education teacher&quot; was the only one who could help<br/>\n  ds. I spent days coming up with a new &quot;learning<br/>\n  program&quot; to work with him that would include more<br/>\n  and more phonics practice. sigh, It was harder<br/>\n  that everyone who unschooled, that I knew, had<br/>\n  kids who were not having any problem picking up<br/>\n  reading. Whereas with ds it was and is like the<br/>\n  printed english language was a foreign language to<br/>\n  him.<br/>\n  I could cry. We started out saying we were<br/>\n  unschoolers but never really seemed to embrace it.<br/>\n  I kept saying I was unschooling but I have never<br/>\n  really trusted ds enough to truly give him his<br/>\n  lead. I always had to be trying to teach him to<br/>\n  read or do &quot;a little&quot; math with him. Once I<br/>\n  finally admitted we were not unschoolers I plunged<br/>\n  ds into &quot;school at home&quot; but he has never taken to<br/>\n  it or reading or math. School is what he does<br/>\n  around the things he wants to do.<br/>\n  Is it the schooling that makes the dyslexic? Maybe<br/>\n  ds would not be having problems with reading and<br/>\n  math if I had just followed his lead. He&#39;s always<br/>\n  said he&#39;s not interested in reading, does not<br/>\n  really care if he can&#39;t (Of course I&#39;ve always put<br/>\n  that down to him not wanting to do something that<br/>\n  he fails at so he&#39;s got a type of  &quot;learned<br/>\n  helplessness&quot; that he uses as a way to protect<br/>\n  himself)<br/>\n  In the last few days I&#39;ve had to rethink<br/>\n  everything. I&#39;m kinda lost right now. I&#39;m not<br/>\n  really sure where we are heading. Is it that<br/>\n  school at home caused the LDs or does he really<br/>\n  have some processing problems that need to be<br/>\n  addressed? Is it still the problem of not working<br/>\n  with ds&#39;s strengths? Everything I read about<br/>\n  dyslexia/language disabilities states how you need<br/>\n  to be working with these kids in intensive phonics<br/>\n  programs like Spaulding or Orton-Gilliham(sp) and<br/>\n  the older they get the less chance there will ever<br/>\n  be for them to read fluently. I had a long talk<br/>\n  with a friend who has known us for years who just<br/>\n  belives ds needs more time.<br/>\n  Can I really drop the reading and math and let him<br/>\n  take his time to find his way with our help? Is it<br/>\n  still &quot;unschooling&quot; if your still insisting that<br/>\n  the child does his therapies (audiblox, braingym,<br/>\n  and earobics in our case) that will help in<br/>\n  processing if ds does really have Dyslexia. Kinda<br/>\n  like medicine for the brain.  I guess I was<br/>\n  wondering if anyone with ld kids have been able to<br/>\n  let go and relax?<br/>\n  I hope I can lurk for awhile while I sort this all<br/>\n  out.<br/>\n  Julie W in AR<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

He may just surprise you on the math and reading skills he does have.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daugther is also a late to read child...she isn&#39;t quite up to where other kids her age are.  Of  course she is also a gesalt learner, and won&#39;t consider herself reading until she is able to read H.P. on her own.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe started penpalling, and neopets, and both have offered her more relaxed opportunities to read.  In fact the other day I typed out a letter for her that she dictated, and she found my spelling and grammar errors.  Welll, at least some.  Realized I said mine istead of my, that I wrote I not I&#39;m.  Pretty cool to me. She also is reading the short descriptions under the pets when the eat something.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you, or does anyone know of the site which recommends using a colored transperancy over the writing to help a child read.  I don&#39;t remember the URL.  I did ask my daughter, as she was watching BETWEEN THE LIONS, taking in how the show highlighted the words of the book they were reading, whether that made it clearer to her, and she felt it did.  I don&#39;t know all the particulars.  You may simply want to cut out a pale colored piece of transparency and place it over the words.  Try different colors etc, lengthening the transparency as he becomes better at reading the words. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as far as math goes,  how does his difficulties manifest itself?  Does he understand the concepts but doesn&#39;t get the memorization?  That will come from naturally working with numbers.  I would let him use a calculator or other device to find the answer to the times tables/addition tables etc.  whatever else he is doing. My concern would be that he knows how to carry and borrow, and when. But other problems may masquarade as an inability in math.  He may have a tactile aversion to paper (so he wouldn&#39;t like holding or touching books either) he may not be able to grip the pencil comfortably.  There are grips that may writing a pleasure, that are fairly cheap.  He may not like the sound of pen/cil against paper.  You can try doing these things on a white board, chalk board, with paint or plain or magnetic number tiles...see if he can do it then.  His hand may tire more easily than the next person, so writing more than one or two sentences or one or two problems will become annoying.  <br/>\n<br/>\n He will, by the way, most likely outgrow the aversion as he gets older.  My son also had this difficulty.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, while it helps to have a label sometimes,  do keep reminding yourself that what matters is he is learning, not how or when he gets to a specific goal. That is the beauty of unschooling.  There is, really, no such thing as being behind or, for that matter, ahead.  There is just the child being the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nbe well,<br/>\nRachel Ann<br/>\n<br/>\n  Can I really drop the reading and math and let him<br/>\n  take his time to find his way with our help?
