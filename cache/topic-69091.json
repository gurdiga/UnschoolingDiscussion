There was a conflct  of information  on their &quot;report card&quot; when their teacher said they actually were doing  just fine. When I went in to enquire I was referred to the remedial teacher-who was by the way a lovely and gentle  teacher- that they were included  to accompany the other girl-who they did not know-( so that wasnt the reason.) and that she thought they would &quot;make a nice little group&quot;-her words which I remember clearly as it all was striking me as so odd <br/>\n. I actually believe that as the girls were not happy with going to school and would cry or make a fuss in the coat room or not come in  from the playground after recess on occasion -they had been labeled  as having &quot;problems&quot; so they  could justify  sending them  to the remedial teacher.   A few months later I mentioned it to  a friend  who was a teacher-she said  &quot;oh they get funded by the head  so they need to have the numbers to keep this teacher in her half time position.&quot;<br/>\nI had no problem with the fact that the girls went to this teacher-they liked her, they liked the little group , being Kindergarten the other kids did not know about labelling them because  they left the room to go into the other group. <br/>\nI did and do  have Big Issues with the way they  maneuver  kids and parents around just because they can.<br/>\nI have seen lots of similar incidents with our own grown kids and some of my other grandkids.<br/>\ngrace<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4324016,"authorName":"Kelly Lenhart","from":"&quot;Kelly Lenhart&quot; &lt;mina@...&gt;","profile":"mommamina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Head Start","postDate":"1071277754","msgId":86154,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA1NGYwMWMzYzExNSRiOWM4MWY0MCQwNTAwMDAwYUBtYWJiLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDMxMjEyMTgzMzQ3LjQ2MzQyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEyNjA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":86153,"nextInTopic":86155,"prevInTime":86153,"nextInTime":86155,"topicId":69091,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was walking into the house from our main street one day with my 2 year old and was greeted by a woman walking down the street.
