Perhaps she needs heavier thicker cord - not synthetic but natural material is easier to manipulate.  Cross stitch floss is difficult to macrame for beginners because if its size and texture.  Also - when I first learned I used cardboard with pins to hold the cord in place until i mastered a knot.  Check out the local crafts shop for heavier cord and simpler picture books.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also write to the company and complain, especially if the beads are too small for the size of the cord and if the directions are lousy.  I used to write directions professionally and am so often appalled by what i see, especially in craft kits for kids.  Who writes this stuff?  Not me &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa H.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Holly Selden <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, March 10, 2004 6:00 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Macrame<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Is anyone here familiar with macrame?
