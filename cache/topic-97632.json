Weeded through them, looked at the pros and<br/>\ncons, objectively <br/>\nmade some  <br/>\nJUDGMENT on what the best way to learn is.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is exactly how I came to unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nKristina, you say:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I guess for me <br/>\nit&#39;s easier to refrain from judging outsiders, whose<br/>\ndecisions don&#39;t <br/>\nreally affect you in any way, than making judgments on<br/>\nmy own kid&#39;s <br/>\nchoices. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt may be *easier* for you, but that doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>\nit&#39;s the better choice.  And, like it or not,<br/>\n&quot;outsiders&#39;&quot; decisions DO affect us all.  For example,<br/>\nmy partner is in favor of us sending our two sons to<br/>\nthe Eugene Waldorf School. *sigh*  He knows ALL these<br/>\ncool, &quot;well adjusted&quot; kids who went there and are now<br/>\nin a good college.  He has serious reservations about<br/>\nour boys being unschooled.  He&#39;s met quite a few kids<br/>\nwho have been &quot;homeschooled&quot; (he doesn&#39;t know if<br/>\nthey&#39;ve been &#39;unschooled&#39;, but to him it&#39;s the same<br/>\nthing although BELIEVE me, I&#39;m working on him...) and<br/>\nhe says they are &#39;lost&#39;, didn&#39;t get a good education,<br/>\ntheir parents were too lax and gave them too much<br/>\nfreedom (??).  SO, all these &#39;outsiders&#39; decisions are<br/>\naffecting our family big time!  Although I can respect<br/>\nmy partner&#39;s opinions and understanding (however<br/>\nlimited) of the Waldorf Education, and<br/>\n&#39;homeschooling&#39;/unschooling, darn right I judge it! <br/>\nHas he done enough research? (No.)  Are his opinions<br/>\neducated? (Not enough for me.)  Yes I can listen<br/>\nrespectfully, but I can also disagree and judge his<br/>\nopinions.  All this, and still love him too.<br/>\n<br/>\nVijay, in your last post you comment:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But this is Goethe&#39;s theory, not Steiner&#39;s. Did<br/>\nSteiner claim to have <br/>\ndiscovered this himself?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vijay Berry Owens<br/>\nSAHM to Charlotte, 14 months<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is very interesting, can you point to a resource?<br/>\n I have very limited knowledge of Goethe, and don&#39;t<br/>\nremember any &#39;color theory&#39; of his, but would love to<br/>\nknow.  I don&#39;t know if Steiner &#39;claimed&#39; to have<br/>\ndiscovered this &#39;color theory&#39;.  All that I have read<br/>\nabout it has been in terms of it&#39;s application and not<br/>\norigins.  As is with the majority of Steiner&#39;s<br/>\nwritings.  If someone knows and/or can point us/me to<br/>\nspecific sources that address the origins of any of<br/>\nhis theories, that would be VERY helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jennefer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
