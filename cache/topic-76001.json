Some children still breast feed at 5. Perhaps unuasual, but still,<br/>\nin some cultures it happens. She is so little! It sounds as though she&#39;s<br/>\njust fine and oh so normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour MIL on the other hand, appears to have issues. Why all the focus on<br/>\nyour daughter? Her own guilt being triggered??? Sounds like it.  It reminds<br/>\nme of my mother who is jealous,  childish,  narcissistic, and very<br/>\nthreatened by anyone who gets more attention than she does. Who would want<br/>\nto sit on someone&#39;s lap who is so obviously a bully? You have a smart kid<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoever it was that said they pack up and leave when someone mistreats her<br/>\nchildren, I applaud you. No child should be forced to tolerate such a creep,<br/>\nfamily or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother has pulled this with me before with not only myself, but my son as<br/>\nwell. She will accuse or point the finger, lie, whatever immature behavior<br/>\nto  attempt to take the focus off of her own behavior and bully. Needless to<br/>\nsay, we rarely see the woman.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo with your heart. Tell that old wench to lay off and mind her own<br/>\nbusiness. Your daughter is just fine and as any healthy child, chooses only<br/>\nto sit on the laps of loving and kind individuals. I&#39;m sure if her heart was<br/>\nin the right place, your daughter would be all over her. Ah, blessed is the<br/>\nwisdom of children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the passionate reaction, but really...What rude nasty things your<br/>\nMIL  has said. Not very loving. I sure as hell wouldn&#39;t want to be in the<br/>\nsame building with someone like that, let alone have physical contact.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe strong Kate!<br/>\n<br/>\nJeva</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75977,"nextTopicId":75940}}
