I believe it is true in many<br/>\nplaces just like it is in my town in CT: The school system pulls most of the<br/>\nstrings of power and money. They want to possess the children, and to be<br/>\npaid for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, Mary, for your research. The story speaks for itself...the<br/>\nauthorities can find enough about any one of us, if they want to, to do<br/>\nterrible things to us -- all within the laws. (just like the schools can use<br/>\nany reason they want to recommend our children get drugged) The problem is<br/>\nthe arrogance of government officials, combined, often, with their deep<br/>\nignorance and feeling a need to control and interfere in people&#39;s lives.<br/>\nIt&#39;s why the laws need constant scrutiny and change.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe stories of Ruby Ridge and Waco have similarities (only much worse) to<br/>\nthe one in Utah years ago. I was farming in western Colorado at the time of<br/>\nthe Utah incident. We saw similar attitudes around us and had Mormon<br/>\nacquaintances among our ranching community. The shooting was big news.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Ned, I no longer have faith in your reporting.  Please withdraw this claim<br/>\n&gt;or give us documentation from an objective source, if possible, and not a<br/>\n&gt;libertarian scare-sermon.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I forget who this was, but I hope she&#39;s satisfied now with my claim and will<br/>\nrefrain from connecting  &quot;libertarian&quot; with &quot;scare&quot; in her future cheap<br/>\nshots.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42240,"nextTopicId":42245}}
