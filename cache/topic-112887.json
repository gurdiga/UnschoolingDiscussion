For all her joy at clothing, she doesn&#39;t like shopping for  <br/>\nclothes.  Or rather she can look a long time but doesn&#39;t like  <br/>\ndressing rooms at all, so after one trip to the dressing room she  <br/>\nwants to come back.  But this is worse.

But she was saying no, let&#39;s go to  <br/>\nfeedstores.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut nobody yelled or cried.  And she said &quot;I had a picture in my mind  <br/>\nof what was going to happen, and my mind picture got jealous.&quot;<br/>\nThat&#39;s a pretty good way to describe an irrational frustration.   She  <br/>\nwants to buy her own salt lick.  She wants to SEE salt licks.

This time we went<br/>\ninto a kids consignment store which said they were having a 65% off winter<br/>\nstuff sale. Beside the clothes that I found my older daughter wanted this<br/>\npurse and a visor hat - her little sister seeing the hat wanted one as<br/>\nwell... and my son who could care less about clothes (except knows what he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like ;-) wanted a bionicle. I thought they had priced them a bit<br/>\nhigh for second hand and was concerned that maybe all the pieces would not<br/>\nbe in it - and then I would have to come back... but I figured the girls<br/>\neach picked out things - and fine if I had to go back because pieces were<br/>\nmissing oh well.... everyone left happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to the library and they were having a used book sale and each picked<br/>\nout a few books -  and to the health food store where Lex picked out a very<br/>\nexpensive organic chocolate bar for each one. When I tried to suggest that<br/>\nmaybe we could get one and share it  - no one could agree on which kinds -<br/>\nso they each got their own and swapped pieces. Happiness $6.00 ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I really needed to do today was go to OfficeMax and exchange<br/>\nmy used printer cartridge for a free ream of paper ;-) We can&#39;t go into a<br/>\nstore where the kids don&#39;t see something they want. My husband thinks I<br/>\nshould be saying no more often.... and they don&#39;t ask him for things very<br/>\noften. But sometimes he will just stop and get an ice cream - or a soda<br/>\nwhile at the gas station...so they do get things - they just may be smaller<br/>\nthings...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - I sometimes feel that I really don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; to spend the extra<br/>\nmoney - I can go in for what I need and get out...but then again it must be<br/>\nhard being a kid without your &quot;own&quot; money. If I see something I want I can<br/>\njust buy it.(Well within reason....) Sometimes kids need to ask - and it can<br/>\nget very frustrating for them if they are always hearing no.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you or someone on this list compared the cost of these little treats<br/>\nto years of adult therapy... certainly the little things win hands down ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sandra Dodd&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, March 18, 2006 3:25 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Article about nice babies<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Mar 18, 2006, at 7:31 AM, Deb Lewis wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s an interesting article but the researcher could have asked a<br/>\n&gt; couple<br/>\n&gt; of unschoolers and saved himself all that time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly and I were at Hastings, a video/music store, last week.
