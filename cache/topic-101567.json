At our house, <br/>\n<br/>\ntattling is when you are trying to get someone INTO trouble, and <br/>\n<br/>\ntelling is when you are trying to stop trouble. IF you aren&#39;t sure, <br/>\n<br/>\ncome tell, because it&#39;s better to tell when you shouldn&#39;t than to <br/>\n<br/>\nnot tell when you should. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it would be better not to even use the term &quot;telling.&quot;<br/>\nThere&#39;s another phrase for tattling which is &quot;to tell on&quot; someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe instead of defining what a child is doing when he wants to talk to his <br/>\nmom, it should just be &quot;talking to his mom.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe current issue of People Magazine has an article on the final defense in <br/>\nScott Peterson&#39;s trial, the statements made by those appealing for life <br/>\nimprisonment over the death sentence.
