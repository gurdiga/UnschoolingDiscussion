It gives<br/>\nchildren a chance to take control of their education (life). I believe that<br/>\nchildren need lots of time to just &quot;think&quot;. I always wonder when I see my<br/>\nchild playing in the sandbox, or pulling weeds in the garden, what they&#39;re<br/>\n&quot;thinking about&quot;. Maybe they&#39;re trying to &quot;figure out the world&quot;, or<br/>\nwondering where their life &quot;fits in&quot; in the grand scheme.<br/>\nSchool takes that away. Children who go to school are always so &quot;busy&quot;.<br/>\nSchool all day, homework, extra-curricular activities... When do they have<br/>\ntime to THINK?!<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree! I spend every day of my THINKING. It&#39;s strange to me that some<br/>\npeople do not constantly think -- I can&#39;t imagine it. Lots of times during<br/>\nthe day I&#39;ll get up and start pacing around the house. It helps me sort<br/>\nthings out in my mind -- and it&#39;s good exersise too, hehe. ;-) ~Eryn<br/>\n<br/>\n==<br/>\n&quot;I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky;<br/>\nthen I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of<br/>\nbeing a butterfuly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am<br/>\na man?&quot; - Chuang Tsu<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.camenaworks.com/Eryn/\">http://www.camenaworks.com/Eryn/</a><br/>\n#24591173  ::she just is::<br/>\nAIM ::  Opal Fayre</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":621,"nextTopicId":528}}
