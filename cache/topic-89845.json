Have her get a <br/>\ncopy of the FFA from any college admissions office, and look <br/>\ncarefully at that requirement.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I posted this, I&#39;ll share just a bit of my experience.  I moved <br/>\nin with a guy when I was 19, in part because my mom had 1. taken away <br/>\nmy college money and 2. made such a big issue of me seeing him <br/>\nseriously -- those actions nearly destroyed our mother/daughter <br/>\nrelationship, and when I needed help and a place to live, I could not <br/>\nmake myself turn to her.  In one sense, she was right -- he was an <br/>\nawful fit for me, and 5 years later I could admit that and move on.  <br/>\nBut I learned a lot along the way, and much of that I wouldn&#39;t trade <br/>\nfor a more normal college experience.  My mom and I are reconciled <br/>\nand quite close now, but that history is forever a part of our <br/>\nrelationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my point is this:  even if it&#39;s not a love that will last for her <br/>\nlifetime, it is certainly something she can learn from.  She will <br/>\ncome out on the other side; she will be okay.  She will be even more <br/>\nokay if she still has her mom on her side.

The racial slurs that flew out of his <br/>\nmouth during his first visit scared the crap out of me.

I did the same thing.  At 17 I got into a <br/>\nserious relationship and moved in with someone that hadn&#39;t finished <br/>\ngrowing up yet.  Even though I knew my mother didn&#39;t agree she never <br/>\nthrew it in my face or cut me off.  When I finally came back, it was <br/>\nhappily.  I kind of kicked myself for &quot;wasting&quot; five years but it <br/>\nwas a learning experience.  I am very grateful that my mother didn&#39;t <br/>\nthrow it in my face or hold it against me. She was just happy to <br/>\nhave me back.  It&#39;s hard to let your children go but if you cut her <br/>\noff she really won&#39;t come back, even if she wanted to.  One thing I <br/>\ndo suggest is that you sit down with her and explain your fears. Not <br/>\nin a judgmental way, but from a human perspective.  Let her know <br/>\nthat aside from worrying for her as a mother, you have your own <br/>\nfears as a person.  Show her that you are just as frail as she is.  <br/>\nSometimes parents approach things from the &quot;parent with authority&quot; <br/>\nposition and it tends to separate you even further from your <br/>\nchildren.

Somehow I don&#39;t get that feeling where<br/>\nher boyfriend is concerned. It seems by saying *she&#39;s convinced* she&#39;s in<br/>\nlove, you don&#39;t believe that to be so. I also get the impression you don&#39;t<br/>\nthink much of her boyfriend. I could be wrong and reading things into your<br/>\npost that you aren&#39;t feeling. Not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if your daughter is making great choices for her now, what makes you<br/>\nthink she will make choices that are disasters when it comes to her<br/>\nboyfriend? It is possible that those two are meant to be together and will<br/>\nlive happily ever after. Maybe not probable, but possible. So support that<br/>\npart of her life as you support all her other choices. She will need you in<br/>\nthe future to either share her happiness with her, or be there for her when<br/>\nthings don&#39;t go well. And if she does chose to move in with him, it will be<br/>\nmuch easier sharing that experience with her instead of trying to talk her<br/>\nout of it, maybe losing some trust you two have established along the way,<br/>\nand even her doing something behind your back because you don&#39;t approve.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not always easy watching our older children make decisions that we may<br/>\nknow in our heart aren&#39;t right for them, but most likely, with our love and<br/>\nsupport, they learn something from that experience whether it&#39;s a good one<br/>\nor bad one. And most likely if that&#39;s the case, those kids are the kind that<br/>\nneed to learn it for themselves, not just by someone telling them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it takes a lot to keep our mouths shut, but it&#39;s worth the effort<br/>\nwhen our children see us respect them and their wishes, no matter how much<br/>\nwe disagree. Telling her what you feel is fine, as long as you&#39;re not<br/>\ntelling her what you think she should do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter will soon be 18, I&#39;ve been through what you are speaking of. It<br/>\nwasn&#39;t easy for me to see her making decisions I considered far from the<br/>\nbest. But she still stayed the great kid she was while finding her way<br/>\nthrough what she wanted. It took longer than what was comfortable for me<br/>\n&lt;bg&gt; but she made wise choices along the way and worked her way through it.<br/>\nAnd more importantly was how our relationship grew through it all. I can&#39;t<br/>\nimagine how either one of us would have felt if she wasn&#39;t comfortable<br/>\nsharing with me what she was going through.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

If you think of something she might not have<br/>\nthought of, you might ask in this way, &quot;Have you<br/>\nthought about the possibility...&quot; and then let her<br/>\nanswer.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive her a chance to tell you her thoughts and dreams<br/>\nand plans.  Don&#39;t interrupt.  Don&#39;t criticize or<br/>\ncontrol.  Every time you feel like you can&#39;t breathe,<br/>\ntake a sip of your chai tea and inhale the steam from<br/>\nthe mug.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like she has made some great and mature<br/>\ndecisions about her life so far, holding down a job<br/>\nand going to school, pursuing her interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe might have very mature, sensible plans and they<br/>\nmight surprise you.  If she has definite goals for her<br/>\nlife, she may already have some ideas about how she<br/>\nwants to reach them.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is almost grown.  You have one more year before<br/>\nshe is a legal adult.  It sounds like she is<br/>\nresponsible and mature.  Trust her a little bit more.<br/>\n<br/>\nLines in the sand can be erased with a big toe, a hug,<br/>\nan apology.  Talking together can help her solidify<br/>\nher goals and the steps needed to get there, and help<br/>\nher establish her own personal boundaries.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n--Susan in VA<br/>\nWifetoVegman<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.

She is a mature 16 yr old (17 in March) who holds<br/>\n down a part-time job, takes a few classes at the community college<br/>\n and is just a great teen who is passionate about a lot of things. She<br/>\n is also convinced she is in love. This has not been a huge issue<br/>\n because her boyfriend lives in Washington (we are in Texas)and they<br/>\n only see each other every 5 or 6 months. Well .. . .he just turned 18<br/>\n and is planning to move here. His father has used bribes (money and a<br/>\n car) to convince him to take his GED and enroll in college. His<br/>\n father is willing to help him financially as long as he is in school.<br/>\n His mother is also willing to help with his living expenses. This man<br/>\n (aahhh! he is a man now) has been in my daughters life for almost 2<br/>\n years now and they have been discussing living together for the past<br/>\n 6 months or so. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou sound like you are very happy with how your daughter is handling her<br/>\nlife in the beginning of the post. Somehow I don&#39;t get that feeling where<br/>\nher boyfriend is concerned. It seems by saying *she&#39;s convinced* she&#39;s in<br/>\nlove, you don&#39;t believe that to be so. I also get the impression you don&#39;t<br/>\nthink much of her boyfriend. I could be wrong and reading things into your<br/>\npost that you aren&#39;t feeling. Not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if your daughter is making great choices for her now, what makes you<br/>\nthink she will make choices that are disasters when it comes to her<br/>\nboyfriend? It is possible that those two are meant to be together and will<br/>\nlive happily ever after. Maybe not probable, but possible. So support that<br/>\npart of her life as you support all her other choices. She will need you in<br/>\nthe future to either share her happiness with her, or be there for her when<br/>\nthings don&#39;t go well. And if she does chose to move in with him, it will be<br/>\nmuch easier sharing that experience with her instead of trying to talk her<br/>\nout of it, maybe losing some trust you two have established along the way,<br/>\nand even her doing something behind your back because you don&#39;t approve.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not always easy watching our older children make decisions that we may<br/>\nknow in our heart aren&#39;t right for them, but most likely, with our love and<br/>\nsupport, they learn something from that experience whether it&#39;s a good one<br/>\nor bad one. And most likely if that&#39;s the case, those kids are the kind that<br/>\nneed to learn it for themselves, not just by someone telling them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it takes a lot to keep our mouths shut, but it&#39;s worth the effort<br/>\nwhen our children see us respect them and their wishes, no matter how much<br/>\nwe disagree. Telling her what you feel is fine, as long as you&#39;re not<br/>\ntelling her what you think she should do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter will soon be 18, I&#39;ve been through what you are speaking of. It<br/>\nwasn&#39;t easy for me to see her making decisions I considered far from the<br/>\nbest. But she still stayed the great kid she was while finding her way<br/>\nthrough what she wanted. It took longer than what was comfortable for me<br/>\n&lt;bg&gt; but she made wise choices along the way and worked her way through it.<br/>\nAnd more importantly was how our relationship grew through it all. I can&#39;t<br/>\nimagine how either one of us would have felt if she wasn&#39;t comfortable<br/>\nsharing with me what she was going through.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129878600,"authorName":"txldy2","from":"&quot;txldy2&quot; &lt;txldy2@...&gt;","profile":"txldy2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"New member ~ done lurking and need advise","postDate":"1075071308","msgId":89845,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJ2MWhnYythZWhsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":89849,"prevInTime":89844,"nextInTime":89846,"topicId":89845,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have been lurking for a few weeks and really enjoying the conversations. ;-) Even though we are secure in our choice to unschool and the changes we have made","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-626936581\">I have been lurking for a few weeks and really enjoying the <br/>\nconversations. ;-) Even though we are secure in our choice to <br/>\nunschool and the changes we have made I felt the need to be a part of <br/>\na bigger unschooling community.
