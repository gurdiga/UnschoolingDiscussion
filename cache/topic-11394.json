She can tell us <br/>\nabout thigns that she/we did long ago.

It was more than a year before.  The <br/>\nfireworkd were part of a display we saw on the way home for <br/>\nGuy Fawkes night.)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe asked me about the farm, and whether daddy had been, and I <br/>\ntold her yes, he was there when u got in with the donkeys...<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\nPS,  it will get better.
