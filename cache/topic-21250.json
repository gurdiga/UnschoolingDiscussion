In addition, if you choose to test you are NOT required to take the same test that the schooled children take, &quot;any nationally normed student achievement test&quot; and I would stay clear of the FCAT altogether (my two cents).  If you go to the official Florida website you can read the statute.  I don&#39;t know the web address but if you search under &quot;State of Florida&quot; it should be the first to come up.  Once there go to the state laws. The statue is Title XVI, Chapter 232.0201, Home Education Programs.  A copy of the law can also be found at www.helpsonline.org (or maybe .com, can&#39;t remember).  If you still can&#39;t find it, e-mail me back, I&#39;ll mail it to you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKandi - in Middleburg, just moved here from Ocala, and born in Hollywood.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21246,"nextTopicId":21251}}
