(oldest has terrible anger rages that can hurt himself and<br/>\n  others if his diet is not right) <br/>\n<br/>\n  Trying to learn... <br/>\n<br/>\n  Rose <br/>\n  ========================================================================<br/>\nWe&#39;re just heading down the allergy/sensitivity road as well because my 3 yo has similar kinds of rages. We&#39;re doing the Feingold, chocolate, dairy and soy (though there&#39;s some soy in the buttery spread that I have).  After 3 days, I&#39;ve noticed a tremendous difference.  He&#39;s gone from 5-7 major meltdowns a day that can last anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes to maybe one or two blips that last a minute or two and can be defused using some of the typical techniques--snuggling, expressing his feelings, humor. This to me is a *major* improvement in our days. We can spend time as a family and play games instead of my girls (dd6 and dd5) having to play by themselves while I try to walk on eggshells and deal with my Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still learning to modify our meals, but yesterday we made oatmeal cookies and waffles with maples syrup. I&#39;m going to pick up some peanut butter so I can make some peanut butter cookies. With the Feingold, it&#39;s not the sugar but the additives, and I know corn syrup can be really bad while all-natural cane sugar can be fine. There are lots of substitutions I can make, and much of it is just a matter of cooking from scratch. I&#39;ve been baking bread every day in the bread machine, things like that.  It&#39;s not really that big a deal, and the kids get to bake more frequently than we used to. I&#39;m new to this, so I&#39;m not really sure what you mean when you say that your kids can&#39;t have sugar or beef. Even the Feingold diet says sugar itself is rarely the cause of hyperactivity--have you checked this out? I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve done your research, but if you gave me more details, I might be able to offer some more suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really trying to look at it in terms of substitution and availability. The key is to allow the kids to make as many of their own choices as they can and to offer as large a range of choices as possible so that they can really exercise that choice. If Sam can&#39;t have Oreos or Fruitloops, yeah that&#39;s a tough break, but he can have lots of other treats. I&#39;m trying to figure out what kinds of treats I *can* have available for him rather than dwelling on all the stuff that we can&#39;t have. For instance, he can&#39;t have Lays potato chips, but he can have Kettle potato chips, so those are down in the snack cart. I&#39;m going to be making as many cookies as I can. They may not be the same cookies that are in all the fancy packaging at the store, but they&#39;re still good and still a treat. If your kids can&#39;t have sugar or one kind of sugar, can they have honey or all-natural maple syrup as a sweetener? See what I&#39;m saying? The treats may not be the same in my house as in someone else&#39;s, but the point is that there are treats available for them to freely choose over other things like carrots or fruit. <br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"Genant2@aol.com","from":"Genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re:  Another food question...","postDate":"1074434890","msgId":89255,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3LjQxNzg4OWNhLjJkM2JlZDRhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":89240,"nextInTopic":89260,"prevInTime":89254,"nextInTime":89256,"topicId":88635,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/18/04 12:20:42 AM Eastern Standard Time, rose@gt.rr.com ...

If the kids want <br/>\n&quot;poptarts&quot;, I don&#39;t buy cereal.  I use the things they want to replace other things <br/>\nthat would usually be on our grocery list.  Also we now waste less food.  I <br/>\nthink this is funny because I always use to be worried about having enough food <br/>\nand making sure all the kids were eating enough and would make them clear <br/>\ntheir plates.

I <br/>\n&gt;wish I<br/>\n&gt;hadn&#39;t.  I put eight out on a plate of snacky stuff during Marty&#39;s birthday<br/>\n&gt;pizza dinner the other night and they went (along with four large pizzas, <br/>\n&gt;two cans<br/>\n&gt;of pineapple chunks, two cans of olives, a bowl of pistachios, a chocolate<br/>\n&gt;orange which had been in the bowl with the Oreos, and 1/3 of a small <br/>\n&gt;birthday<br/>\n&gt;cake.  They didn&#39;t want cake.  They were full of pizza.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Nobody came and said &quot;Do you have more Oreos?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I did.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Still do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If the kids are with you at the store, they can get the same thrill of<br/>\n&gt;choosing just for you letting them choose which fruit and vegetables to <br/>\n&gt;get, which<br/>\n&gt;juice to get, what cereal.  You could ask if they want to pick something, <br/>\n&gt;or<br/>\n&gt;you could cruise the canned fruit aisle, or dried fruit in bags, or <br/>\n&gt;something<br/>\n&gt;new and different to them.

The response <br/>\nwas something like &quot;I can&#39;t afford to buy all the video games in the world.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUh... <br/>\nYeah.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was a non-sequitor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo with food.  You don&#39;t have to buy the whole grocery store to loosen up on <br/>\nrules and regulations regarding the ingestion of foodstuffs within the <br/>\nconfines of your home.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I go to the store, I ask my kids if there&#39;s something they want.  <br/>\nUsually they say no.   Sometimes they&#39;ll name something they&#39;ve had a craving for.  <br/>\nRecent requests were some jelly other than grape, bananas, <br/>\nwhatever-those-nuts-are-in-that-candy (filberts, I said, and we found them in the shell at Wild <br/>\nOats), Malt-o-Meal, and cranberry juice.<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody has asked for candy or cookies.  I asked for Oreos a couple of weeks <br/>\nago and Keith brought oreos with chocolate inside.  I didn&#39;t care.  Holly <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like them and asked if we could get regular ones next time.  So I bought <br/>\nregular ones.  That&#39;s been over a week.  I&#39;ve eaten a dozen of them.  I wish I <br/>\nhadn&#39;t.  I put eight out on a plate of snacky stuff during Marty&#39;s birthday <br/>\npizza dinner the other night and they went (along with four large pizzas, two cans <br/>\nof pineapple chunks, two cans of olives, a bowl of pistachios, a chocolate <br/>\norange which had been in the bowl with the Oreos, and 1/3 of a small birthday <br/>\ncake.  They didn&#39;t want cake.  They were full of pizza.<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody came and said &quot;Do you have more Oreos?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI did.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the kids are with you at the store, they can get the same thrill of <br/>\nchoosing just for you letting them choose which fruit and vegetables to get, which <br/>\njuice to get, what cereal.
