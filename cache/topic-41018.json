Why anti<br/>\n&gt; unschooling?  Because one of the reasons people choose<br/>\n&gt; to unschool is the belief that there is no<br/>\n&gt; prescription for learning, life or ideas and each one<br/>\n&gt; of us as an individual and as a community, create it<br/>\n&gt; as we go along with an open mind and tolerance to<br/>\n&gt; others way of being. Removing Ned from the list is<br/>\n&gt; putting the unschooling ideas into a circle and<br/>\n&gt; punishing those, whom some of the list members think,<br/>\n&gt; are crossing the line. Such an action is assuming that<br/>\n&gt; there are external prescriptions for unschooling. If<br/>\n&gt; we keep an attitude of plentiful we can be a better<br/>\n&gt; force for change.<br/>\n&gt; Olly<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree........ I want Ned to stay.....

I wonder about the control issue.....<br/>\nOur we going to be like the gov&#39;t and try and control peoples thoughts, <br/>\nfreedoms, speech, wants, needs, etc.?<br/>\nWe may not all agree with Ned, but I am glad that he is here and I have <br/>\nenjoyed reading his points of view on things either way.<br/>\nAnyhow, Ned, if you are going to start your own  message group, please <br/>\nremember me and sign me up.
