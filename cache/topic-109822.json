I didn&#39;t know it for many  years.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t see how he could be blamed for recognizing and using that  power (bigger <br/>\nand stronger and smarter) in the total ABSENCE of any kind of  parental input. I <br/>\nam so ashamed of myself for allowing my younger son to even  *feel* <br/>\nvictimized and powerless over and over again, in a pattern, set up by my  &quot;rules&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis policy FAILED my sons.  I have indisputable proof from their very  own <br/>\nmouths about the effects this had on them.  Even the eldest knew what  he was <br/>\ndoing was wrong, and he shouldn&#39;t have had to feel that  self-loathing.  At the <br/>\nvery least my younger son shouldn&#39;t have been made  to feel powerless at the <br/>\nhands of someone who was supposed to love him,  while his parents were <br/>\ncomplicit in it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKids DON&#39;T know how to work it out.  They NEED input from their  parents.  <br/>\nYou DON&#39;T know if they are all happy with the outcome of any spat  that you <br/>\ndidn&#39;t &quot;interfere&quot; in, because I guarantee you your kids are NOT  telling you <br/>\neverything about how they feel.  This policy robs them of any  chance of <br/>\ndeveloping their own power, and they could really suffer from  it.  I hope you change <br/>\nyour policy.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela","from":"&quot;Angela&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] OT:  Fighting kids","postDate":"1132009158","msgId":109848,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWM1ZTk2ZiQwYjQ1OWI4MCQ2OTAwYThjMEBlYm9ueT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUxMTE0MjE0NzUwLjg0MzI5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzNDAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":109847,"nextInTopic":109850,"prevInTime":109847,"nextInTime":109849,"topicId":109822,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" I do just the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2126353382\">&lt;&lt;I have a policy of not interferring in sibling conflict unless they ask<br/>\nfor my help, or, more likely, come to complain about the sibling.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI do just the opposite.

I find that most of the time they will work it out and adult intervention isn&#39;t particulary helpful.  When they do ask for my help, I usually make several suggestions to see if any of those are aggreable to both.  If after several suggestions neither is aggreable to solving the issue, I remove whatever the source fo the issue is until they come up with an idea.  As an example, if the dispute is over a game, this would be a common one at my house.  I would make several suggestions, like replay the turn, start a new game, have older kid &#39;show them how to get through the &#39;level&#39;, then give younger kid two turns, change to single player and alternate rather than compete etc...  If none of this works, then they just have to take a break from the game until they can solve it.  <br/>\nAnother frequent conflict is if they both want to use the same cd for the computer.  I just don&#39;t buy duplicate software:0)...sooo I will try to suggest a cool alternative so they are happy about taking turns.  Clue finders is popular at my house right now, so while one is playing clue finders I have a cool dvd for the other to watch, then they could switch.  Once in a while it just helps for themto have an afternoon apart.  In which case I let them each invite a friend over so they  play separately for a while.
