A friend had told me about it and I knew his daughter and how I adored her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the decision for me to take my kids out of school came, I wrestled with it.  I *wanted* to unschool..but I had a lot of fears.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first day that I tried to sit Madison down to &quot;do work&quot; and saw the look on his face.  It was pain.  It was anxiety.  It was him saying &quot;So you took me out of school to do this???  Is this love????&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t been at this that long.  Really...a very short time.  In the last couple of weeks, the things I&#39;ve witnessed by child-led learning.  Yesterday, he pulled out a set of subtraction flash cards and said to my 5yo &quot;Max, you wanna learn subtraction?  I have an idea for a math game!!!&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t give him that idea.  I didn&#39;t even realize the flashcards were buried somewhere in his room.  In the process of finding them, he not only got a little math in, but made up a game for his younger brother!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy workbook voice got killed when I saw that look on his face...it&#39;s been getting quieter every day as I watch them learning.  Sure, most times, the first thing out of his mouth in the morning is &quot;Can I play the PS2???&quot;.  My little gamer (gee, wonder where he gets it *whistles*).  <br/>\n<br/>\nJump in, Priscilla!  The water&#39;s fine.  It&#39;s really amazing the things they&#39;ll want to learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Wife2Vegman <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, February 11, 2004 5:08 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] unschooling math and saxon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- Dawn Adams &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wishbone@...\">Wishbone@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes, but you have to just tell the little workbook<br/>\n  demon voice to shut up.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You can&#39;t unschool everything except math.

Some have teachers who loved 18th C. literature so they&#39;ve read <br/>\nfifteen novels from that time and as many poems.  Some read zip from that <br/>\ncentury.

Someday you&#39;ll stop measuring, if you don&#39;t give up in <br/>\nfear before then.<br/>\n<br/>\nOccasionally I see a lack in one of my kids.  But way more than occasionally <br/>\nI see a stunning maturity or ability or experience I know they would not have <br/>\nhad if they had been in school.  And I have never yet seen a lack I thought <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t be overcome with a little practice or inquiry later.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty is fifteen and is at the moment in his third of ten driver&#39;s ed <br/>\nclassroom sessions.  The only slightly schoolish thing he had ever done before was a <br/>\nweeklong intense Jr. Police Academy, last summer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMarty was afraid he wouldn&#39;t be able to take notes fast enough.  He sat and <br/>\nwrote things one night, practicing writing quickly and legibly.  He&#39;s <br/>\nblockprinting.  I asked if it would help to hold his notebook this way or that, but he <br/>\nsaid no, he was on it as was.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMarty&#39;s a lefty.  He&#39;s good at spatial reasoning and mathish stuff.  Puzzles. <br/>\n He can do any of those little nine-square puzzles in a minute.  I&#39;ve never <br/>\nfinished one in my life.  We quit buying them for him.  $6 or $8 apiece, and he <br/>\nworks them in a minute or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Marty had been in school, he and we would have heard the word &quot;dyslexic&quot; <br/>\nmany times, but Marty never heard it once unless he heard it from friends of <br/>\nhis or on TV.  It didn&#39;t matter, because we didn&#39;t press him to do anything <br/>\nbefore he just figured out how to do it.  He would have had to figure out his own <br/>\nway to do it at school anyway.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMonday night they gave a pre-test.  He missed four.  Three were because he <br/>\nmisread a question.  It was asked (in what exact words I don&#39;t know) for them to <br/>\nindicate which thing was not needed in the car when driving.  The right <br/>\nanswer would have been the car&#39;s title.  Marty had two disadvantages. He was <br/>\nunaware of testing traditions and set-ups.  He read it as &quot;what do you need when <br/>\nyou&#39;re driving&quot; and marked all but one answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis main problem was not knowing that multiple choice questions generally <br/>\nonly have one answer (and certainly on a ten-item test).  So he got three points <br/>\noff on one item. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe still got his learner&#39;s permit, and he didn&#39;t know what the title of an <br/>\nautomobile was anyway.  Neither did the other kids, but they knew enough from <br/>\nhaving taken tests for years that the one thing they&#39;d never heard of was &quot;the <br/>\nright answer.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause he missed it, though, we told him about what automobile titles are <br/>\nand why they shouldn&#39;t be carried in the car.  He and Keith had watched a movie <br/>\nabout racing for titles, and Keith reminded him that&#39;s what they are.  Oh!   <br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt any of the other kids, who got it right, discussed car titles when <br/>\nthey got home.  Maybe. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe very small list of things that schools consider &quot;everything&quot; is not worth <br/>\nbasing a life on.   If I lived my life so that my children would have that <br/>\nset of information, they would be missing much more information.  The small set <br/>\nthey can pick up later.  The larger, no-walls wide-world set of information <br/>\nseems to them theirs.  They don&#39;t know what is &quot;too old&quot; or &quot;too young&quot; or &quot;too <br/>\nhard&quot; for them.  They learn what they learn.  They ask what they wonder.   If <br/>\nlater they want to checklist themselves on what they might have missed in <br/>\nschool, it won&#39;t take long.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-sure i know i can look back when my kids are teens and adults and say, <br/>\n&quot;oh, yeah, they learned.&quot; -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will help if you can find other people&#39;s older kids and just hang out with <br/>\nthem.

JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to hear it, JJ.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaxon math up to third grade is very very different than Saxon math <br/>\nstarting with Saxon 5/4 and up through the higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaxon math up through 3rd grade is a very very very scripted (tells <br/>\nparent what to say) program that has lots of hands-on manipulative <br/>\nstuff, activities, and focuses on the real math young children are <br/>\ndiscovering around them. It is a big waste of money - for an attentive <br/>\nparent. There isn&#39;t anything in it that any child wouldn&#39;t come up with <br/>\njust in the course of daily life - assuming a parent who puts some <br/>\neffort into being with their kids and explaining things to them and <br/>\nhelping them understand things in a way that works for them. Assuming a <br/>\ncurious and enthusiastic parent who looks it up when the kid wonders <br/>\nwhy we have 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour and who <br/>\nthinks about why we have a ones place and a tens place and so on. <br/>\nParents don&#39;t have to KNOW everything. Unschooling parents really ought <br/>\nto be willing to wonder and think and investigate though and, when it <br/>\ncomes to math, they have to be careful not to avoid it or brush it off <br/>\nor say how they hate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter 3rd grade level, Saxon is a program that emphasizes computational <br/>\nskills and provides almost no explanation or context of any kind for <br/>\nwhy the particular technique works as it does or when or why you&#39;d ever <br/>\nwant to do it. For a long time I had a bunch of Saxon books around here <br/>\nand found them useful to quickly look up something I&#39;d forgotten, how <br/>\nto find the volume of a cone, for example. Now I&#39;d just google it, so I <br/>\nthrew the Saxon math books away to clear some space. Saxon books <br/>\nprovide brief explanations of HOW to perform some computation, an <br/>\nexample or two or three, and then many many problems to work. There is <br/>\na set of 25 to 35 problems after each new computational skill is <br/>\nintroduced, but only about 5 of the problems are practicing that new <br/>\nskill, the rest are review of skills previously introduced. This way <br/>\nstudents practice everything they&#39;ve learned repeatedly, not just <br/>\npractice the new skill and then not see it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t really see a place for Saxon math in an unschooler&#39;s life. I <br/>\ncan see a math book for older kids who have developed an understanding <br/>\nof math concepts and wants to learn to &quot;do&quot; math - meaning wants to <br/>\nlearn all the math computation techniques that are usually in, say, a <br/>\npre-algebra book, but unschoolers in that position would find Saxon far <br/>\ntoo dense - they wouldn&#39;t want to spend that much time reviewing over <br/>\nand over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that reviewing is necessary because the students aren&#39;t learning it <br/>\nwhen it is introduced. It has to be drummed into their heads.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut an interested learner who has the background understanding of why <br/>\nthings work as they do and who is learning it with a context in mind <br/>\nwhere it would be useful - doesn&#39;t have the need to force things into <br/>\ntheir brain with the Saxon sledgehammer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do worry about unschooled kids and math - ONLY because so many of <br/>\ntheir parents are so math phobic that they don&#39;t &quot;naturally&quot; support <br/>\nthe math learning that would otherwise ordinarily happen in an <br/>\nunschooling family. I think unschooling parents have an obligation to <br/>\ntheir children to find a way to get past their own math anxieties and <br/>\nphobias.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrowing a Saxon math book in front of them is a good way to pass ON <br/>\nthose anxieties and phobias, imo.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.

Please bear with me while I try to <br/>\nexplain.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has to do with the ways school teach, life all broken up into subjects, <br/>\nhistory, science, math and so on. To many people these subjects represent <br/>\neverything important about school and also the way school teaches them is the <br/>\naccepted method, very defined.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is life, our life here that is working pretty darned good. The <br/>\nthings I find myself thinking are important for life are sooo different. What I <br/>\nsee my kids doing is having a life, learning the good stuff that is important <br/>\nin their individual lives. They are very different people even though they are <br/>\nin the same family. If they were in school they would both be learning, let me <br/>\nrephrase that since we really don&#39;t know that they are learning anything the <br/>\nschool thinks is being taught.  They would be hearing basically the same <br/>\ninformation over time, the same subjects presented in very similar ways so they <br/>\n(kids) might look and sound more alike if they were in school than they do now <br/>\nsince they are not and are at home and have not been encouraged for a long time <br/>\nto think or act alike.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have trouble articulating for myself let alone anyone else how the old <br/>\nschool model of subjects fits into our life. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t think any of <br/>\nthose things are important but I don&#39;t necessarily think they are more <br/>\nimportant than other things they might learn like how to buy groceries or buy a car <br/>\nor teach someone snowboarding. They all have their place in life.<br/>\n<br/>\n When you have lived a lifetime thinking that we have to learn American <br/>\nHistory in 10th grade or whatever but then one day you look at American History <br/>\ndifferently and think how can I ever decide what parts are good or important to <br/>\nlearn and what parts we can let go? When you visit say Williamsburg and you <br/>\nread and walk and listen to the reenactors and you realize that there was much, <br/>\nmuch more to this whole story that was ever in any textbook in 10th grade. Then <br/>\nI start thinking about all of the subjects in the school model and all the <br/>\nthings my kids are doing, they are very busy  working on becoming themselves <br/>\nwhich takes a lot more time than kids are usually allowed. Whew!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dilemma is then just quieting that old voice in my head that now and then <br/>\nworries that somehow I am shortchanging my kids by not covering the <br/>\n&quot;subjects&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven rereading this is funny because I know they already know a lot in all <br/>\ndifferent subjects but I just can&#39;t box it up nice and pretty so I can check it <br/>\noff a list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sure hope this is understandable, thanks for reading,<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90973,"nextTopicId":90982}}
