Different people have different ideas of what<br/>\n*expensive* is when it comes to the cost of feeding the family, though. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nI worked for a family with a private chef.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was their personal dog groomer: they had a top-of-the-line groom room <br/>\nbuilt for me to work in. They had four standard poodles. Their <br/>\ndaughter, who also lived on the grounds in her own home, had two <br/>\nminiature poodles, two toy poodles, and one shih tzu. They also had <br/>\nanother standard poodle that lived in Arizona and visited often. I <br/>\ngroomed them all once a week. It was a FULL day of grooming---sometimes <br/>\n8:00 to 8:00.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best part was LUNCH! Alicia was, well IS, a wonderful chef.  She <br/>\nworked Monday through Friday and cooked lunch for the staff and supper <br/>\nfor the family. Lunch was always delicious. I often worked late enough <br/>\nto watch her preparing supper---WOW! To eat like that every night! &lt;g&gt; <br/>\nI took home many recipes and ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrazy place though! Along with me and Alicia, the chef, there were two <br/>\npersonal secretaries, a housekeeper, a laundress (really! someone who <br/>\n*just* did laundry!!!), a gardener and his wife, who was a florist <br/>\n(fresh flowers inside all the time!). There was a foreman, who did all <br/>\nthe outside stuff---like maintain the cars (gas, oil, wash, etc.) and <br/>\njust fix things, and numerous part-time folks---like the hairdresser, <br/>\nthe massage therapist, the dog trainer, etc. At one Christmas party, <br/>\nthe boss announced that they had eighteen employees!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe house was HUGE! 12,000 square feet, until they built the 7,000 sqft <br/>\naddition---now 19,000 sqft! The addition had imported Italian tile in <br/>\nthe entrance. They imported Italians to lay the tile! &lt;G&gt; Didn&#39;t speak <br/>\na word of English, but they were adorable. The new master bedroom had <br/>\nfiber optics lights in the ceiling so that it looked like the night <br/>\nsky. There was also a new spa with a table for her massages and a <br/>\nbarber chair and sink for her hairdresser---not to mention the lap <br/>\npool---the kind with a current so that you stay in one place? &lt;g&gt; What <br/>\na hoot! The new addition had a separate full kitchen. There was also a <br/>\nsummer kitchen off the garage.  They had a boat house with a full <br/>\napartment above (with its own kitchen!) and my groom room below. Tennis <br/>\ncourts, and an eight hole golf course. It&#39;s surrounded by the lake on a <br/>\npoint with an outdoor pool (in addition to the indoor lap pool). I <br/>\nlooked for a photo. I guess the website is no longer up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey weren&#39;t a very nice family. But the money was good----until it ran <br/>\nout. Now they&#39;re living in the boat house to avoid paying the <br/>\nelectricity bills on the big house. No more staff, although I&#39;m sure <br/>\nthere&#39;s at least a weekly maid. I guess they eat out every meal? House <br/>\nin on the market. They were trying to sell it for $7 million at one <br/>\ntime. They backed out of an auction just a little while ago when the <br/>\nprice went no higher than $3 million.

I AM a great cook & Dh teases me that I should start a similar <br/>\nbusiness.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that aside, this question (& responses) has brought up 2 trains<br/>\nof thought: 1- Will Unschooling prepare my DD for a livelihood? & 2-<br/>\nWill she ever see the need to create order out of chaos?<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so she turned 5 yesterday & we&#39;re not expecting her to be self-<br/>\nsufficient for sometime yet, but these concerns are always coming to <br/>\nmind!<br/>\n<br/>\nTrack 1- Observing my dd as she pretends (to be a chef, doctor,<br/>\ngarbage man, ballerina, Derek Jeter), I see that she follows <br/>\nprocesses that are clearly obvious to her, asks her patients/clients <br/>\nabout their wants & needs, seeks solutions to obstacles. All skills <br/>\nthat she will use to set & achieve goals that will allow her to <br/>\nfollow her dreams.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis line is of major concern to my dh. Who also got to see her <br/>\ncompletely focused last night. After our birthday dinner at DD&#39;s <br/>\nfavorite Japanese Hibachi, Mom got to go to bed early. Dad watched DD <br/>\nprepare a birthday gift for Mom, complete with a newly drawn card & <br/>\ndinner(bowl of cereal & a glass of water), which she carried all the <br/>\nway upstairs to my bed! <br/>\n<br/>\nTrack 2- Finding Method in Mayhem. DD sees little need to pick up <br/>\nanything that she plays with! I explain that things are often easier <br/>\nto find if you put similar items together. Her solution is to dump <br/>\neach container until she finds what she needs, or is distracted by <br/>\nsomething she&#39;s come across! I focus on safety issues (not leaving <br/>\nthings on steps or in exits). I also remind her that our Jack Russell <br/>\nTerrier can chew thru anything in a matter of seconds. &quot;It&#39;s okay, <br/>\nshe can have that&quot;, is her response. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re expecting a large group of family & friends to help us <br/>\ncelebrate DD&#39;s birthday in 2 days, so trying to tidy the house is <br/>\never present in mind. It also means that DH will tackle major house <br/>\nrepairs, prior to guests arriving. This year, Spring only got here a <br/>\nfew days ago, so outside maintenance and things that require open <br/>\nwindows have had to be postposned. I have reconciled myself to the <br/>\nfact that my home will never be &quot;neat enough&quot;.

You do the things you have to  do, <br/>\neven though you don&#39;t want to, because you know doing them will be better  than <br/>\nnot doing them.<br/>\n <br/>\nAt the last minute (night before), I asked my mother to drive me to  Little <br/>\nRock, about 3 hours away from here.  I knew Will, who&#39;s 11, would  resist the <br/>\nidea of getting up too early, at least at first, so I told her I  would be by <br/>\nat 9:00, using the shorthand explanation that that is when Will  would be able <br/>\nto be up and ready.  I hadn&#39;t had a chance to talk to him  about it, yet, and <br/>\nI knew he likes having information well in advance of change  of plans, and <br/>\nthis was rather last minute and he may have had plans for his  day.  She didn&#39;t <br/>\nlike 9:00, because she&#39;s an early riser and can&#39;t really  drive at night so an <br/>\nearly start (7:00) would be better for her.  After I  told her 9:00, she made <br/>\na semi-sarcastic comment like, &quot;Let me know when the  Little Prince would <br/>\nlike to get up and I&#39;ll be ready.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nThat kind of ticked me off, but I steeled myself so we wouldn&#39;t argue  all <br/>\nthe way to Little Rock. She cleverly worked the phrase &quot;Little Prince&quot; into  the <br/>\nconversation a couple of more times.  I ignored it.<br/>\n <br/>\nAfter that, I phoned my husband (who was watching Will at baseball  practice) <br/>\nand told him the situation, and asked him to explain to Will on  the way home <br/>\nwhy we needed to go THAT day and not any other.  When they  came in the house <br/>\nlater I asked Will if he knew about what was happening in the  morning.  He <br/>\nwas aware, and didn&#39;t complain.  He knew we&#39;d have  to get up even earlier than <br/>\n7:00 to get to my mother&#39;s by then.  I told him  I would get his clean <br/>\nclothes out of the dryer and he could wear his clothes to  bed if he wanted, and I <br/>\nwould just bundle him up in the morning in a blanket and  walk him sleepily to <br/>\nthe car.  He thought that was a good idea, and decided  to get in the shower <br/>\nright then so he would be clean for the next day.<br/>\n <br/>\nLater, as I was going up to bed, I found Will in his room setting his alarm  <br/>\nclock for 6:05.  He saw me and said, &quot;I&#39;m settimg my clock so you won&#39;t  have <br/>\nto wake me up in the morning.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nOkay. &lt;g&gt;  His alarm did go off at 6:05 and when I heard it I  helped him get <br/>\ndressed and bundled him in a blanket and walked him sleepily to  the car.  <br/>\nI&#39;d already started the car and turned on the heated seat so he  would be warm <br/>\nand comfy and get another 1/2 hour of sleep.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe was willing to get on board with the plan, because he knew I was being  <br/>\nconsiderate of what he needed.  He knew his sister-in-law was in the  hospital <br/>\nand couldn&#39;t sell the van she needed to sell. He knew I was the best  one to <br/>\nhandle it.  He knew that the next 2 weeks were booked solid for us  and Thursday <br/>\nwas the ONLY day we could do this.  He knew WHY what we were  doing had to be <br/>\ndone that day, with little notice, and he knew all that because  I was <br/>\nconsiderate of him.  And in turn, he was considerate of me AND my  mother.  She <br/>\nnever even got to know it, because she&#39;d prefer to think that  he was coddled and <br/>\ncatered to, like a little prince.  My mistake was not  explaining to her that <br/>\nI was *simply* taking his needs into consideration, and  thus her sarcastic <br/>\ncomment.  It&#39;s not the way of the world to take ALL the  needs of children into <br/>\nconsideration.  But, what goes around, comes  around.
