If you use Outlook Express,<br/>\nright click on Local Folders and then click new folder.  Make a folder for<br/>\neach category you want. I make one for each list I&#39;m on.  Then click Tools,<br/>\nMessage Rules, and then Mail.  Now you can set up your filters.  Click New.<br/>\nIn #1, click where subject line contains specific words.  In #2 click move<br/>\nto specified folder.  In #3 you click on the underlined words to edit them.<br/>\nSo for specified words, you&#39;d click that and then type in<br/>\nUnschooling-dotcom.  Then click specified and choose which folder it will go<br/>\nto.<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\nAlso, it would help everyone else if you delete everything but the specific<br/>\nwords you want to quote in your reply.
