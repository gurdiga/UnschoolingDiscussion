Kimber&#39;s intuition is correct, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe state does not own anyone&#39;s children. It has no right to act as though<br/>\nit owns them. Therefore it cannot control children who are not under its<br/>\n&quot;care&quot; by contract with the parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe state (the education establishment -- unions)  will continue to harass<br/>\nand intimidate homeschoolers until a family challenges these vague and<br/>\ndishonest regulations. When they are challenged and their true intent of<br/>\ncontrol is revealed, they will be removed, and homeschooling will be better<br/>\nfor everyone. All testing should be under the control of the people in<br/>\ncharge of the child, no one else.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat gives a &quot;state&quot; the right to test children who have opted out of its<br/>\nschools, especially since their reason for homeschooling was that the<br/>\nschools are inadequate and the tests are meaningless and dishonest?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tests have nothing to do with education. They are used as a mechanism to<br/>\ncontrol people and money.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41274,"nextTopicId":41528}}
