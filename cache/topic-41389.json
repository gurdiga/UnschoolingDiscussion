Prayer is doing what&#39;s good and right.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If God is &quot;omniscient&quot; as we are told, then do we really need to tell God<br/>\n&gt; our needs, or ask for favors?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, Ned, <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you don&#39;t.  Maybe prayer for you is living; as you suggest above, it&#39;s<br/>\ndoing what&#39;s good and right.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with<br/>\ndoing what&#39;s good and right, mind you!  But yes, I need to pray.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I don&#39;t think that prayer is about begging God for favors, nor do I<br/>\nthink that it&#39;s telling God what God already knows.  Prayer is about ME.  If<br/>\nI never stop to think, to be quiet, to sit and &quot;be&quot; in the presence of God,<br/>\nwhich to me is praying, I am not right with myself or God.  As my husband<br/>\nsays, I become a human doing instead of a human being.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that sounds a lot like meditation, you&#39;re right.  But there&#39;s another<br/>\nelement of it for me, and that&#39;s talking to God.  Yea, I believe that God<br/>\ndoes already know.  (But sometimes my husband does, too, and I talk to him!)<br/>\nIf I believe that God is great and a wonderful power in my life, then surely<br/>\nin my prayers it makes sense to stop and say thank you.  (If I believe that<br/>\nyour posts are useful, I say thank you to you, too, right?  Why not God?!)<br/>\nWhy ask God for something?  Because it surely doesn&#39;t hurt to ask.  I find<br/>\npeace in asking God to be with someone in need, in telling God my fears and<br/>\nasking for his peace, and things like that.  Does God give me everything I<br/>\nask?  Of course not.  I don&#39;t give my son everything he asks for, either.<br/>\nSomethings aren&#39;t the right thing for us, whether or not we can see that at<br/>\nthe time.   But prayer is important to me, and to many other folks as well.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41348,"nextTopicId":41390}}
