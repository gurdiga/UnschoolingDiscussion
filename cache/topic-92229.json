You need to have Action Replay for gamecube (it comes with a disk and it&#39;s own &quot;memory&quot; card), and enter the master code at the top to activate it.  The test room codes are near the bottom of the page.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://us.codejunkies.com/codes_show.asp?c=US&cr=USD&cs=$&r=0&l=1&g=7340272&p=7\">http://us.codejunkies.com/codes_show.asp?c=US&cr=USD&cs=$&r=0&l=1&g=7340272&p=7</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf the link above doesn&#39;t work, just go to codejunkies.com and search for wind waker ... that should bring it up.  Tons of codes to play around with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd another use for codes ... this morning Michael (he&#39;s 6) was playing this.  Last night he tried a few times to bomb this wall he needed to get through while his boat was caught in a whirlpool.  He can only carry 30 bombs and got discouraged after a few tries (he either ran out of bombs and had to go buy more or eventually got sucked into the whirlpool).  This morning he came down and said he had a great idea!  He started up the game and activated the infinite bombs code.  He was through the wall in a couple of minutes!  :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI really love all the different kinds of learning that happen when using game codes.  Michael used the code to compensate for his lack of experience aiming his cannon, plus to overcome his lack of confidence when faced with two variables - the aiming the bombs at the wall and the whirlpool spinning him around.  If he found lots of things frustrating in the game he would realize it was beyond his skill and give up pretty soon, even with codes.   But using them to get through a few tough spots shows some cool problem-solving!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll stop now.  :)  I could go on and on about all the learning that happens when playing video/computer games, even when they&#39;re being played &quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":135843572,"authorName":"24hrmom","from":"&quot;24hrmom&quot; &lt;24hrmom@...&gt;","profile":"learn2day2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: fun in violence","postDate":"1080229211","msgId":92250,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzNDYwMWM0MTI3ZiQ3NWM3YzczMCQwMzAwYThjMEBUaW5rZXJiZWxsPg==","referencesHeader":"PGMzdGhhdStkNDc0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDMwNjAxYzQxMjY4JGM2NmRhNjMwJDAzMDBhOGMwQFRpbmtlcmJlbGw+IDwwMzJmMDFjNDEyN2EkNzg0ZWIyNzAkZmQwMGE4YzBASmVubnk+"},"prevInTopic":92246,"nextInTopic":92260,"prevInTime":92249,"nextInTime":92251,"topicId":92229,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" LOL!

They played around with / built a VB version of Frogger.  He ended up being the only kid that week (they have 4 max per course); when I realized that I spoke with the teacher/leader and told him not to worry about following the &quot;course outline&quot;, to feel free to follow my son&#39;s lead - my money after all!  So the guy let him bring in his own sprites / files of fave Golden Sun characters and stick them in for the frogs etc. Joseph had fun with that!  In fact, he mentioned the course this morning in his ramblings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey gave him his code at the end of the week so we could pull that out, grab VB for Dummies / online tutorials and he can play around some more.

I grew up with Pac Man and Pong . not much you<br/>\ncan do with those!  <br/>\n <br/>\nI probably would do both - first say &quot;that&#39;s terrible&quot; and then laugh.<br/>\nMy first response would be a conditioned response so the collective<br/>\n&quot;they&quot; wouldn&#39;t think I was a mean person who enjoyed hurting people but<br/>\nI would probably think it was funny because my sense of humor is kind of<br/>\ndry.  My dh gets the brunt of that when he stubs his toe and I laugh<br/>\nhysterically - but I do the same when I hurt myself (which could be<br/>\nconsidered odd I guess if I stop to think about it).<br/>\n <br/>\nMy 5yo once in a while plays with dolls and says &quot;I&#39;m going to kill you,<br/>\nyou are dead now!&quot;  She realized what death was last year when her Nana<br/>\ndied so she understands that you go away forever.  I think she&#39;s just<br/>\nworking out the concept.  Although I did once say &quot;I&#39;m going to brain<br/>\nyour father!&quot; and she took me very literally.  &quot;No MOM!  You can&#39;t take<br/>\ndaddy&#39;s brain!&quot;  I had to explain about phrases we use but assured her I<br/>\nwould not actually take his brain.
