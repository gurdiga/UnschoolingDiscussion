It may <br/>\ntake long-term observation.  Some food allergies can really make kids lose <br/>\ncontrol.  Otherwise, maybe an extreme sensitivity to texture, light, or <br/>\nsound?  I think it&#39;s helpful to get a notebook and write down details of each <br/>\nincident.  Maybe make a chart that shows how often problems occur and at what <br/>\ntime of day?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf if would make you feel more empowered to be able to &quot;do&quot; something, then <br/>\npro-actively following a Feingold diet, or a food elimination plan, or just <br/>\nbuying healthfood with fewer additives for awhile might be worthwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn younger kids, tantrums are a fairly normal response to the &quot;last straw&quot; of <br/>\nstress.  It could just be that.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!
