They<br/>\nare being offered in our area for the first time. I&#39;ve long been intrigued<br/>\nbased on what I&#39;ve read, but before I plunk down my money I&#39;d love to hear<br/>\npros and cons from anyone out there. How much does class success depend on<br/>\nthe individual teacher? Is there an optimimum class size (ie. too few and<br/>\nnot enough fun energy, too many and too much chaos)? My kids are five and<br/>\n2.3 and I&#39;d want to take them together. Also, we sing and dance around here<br/>\nalmost constantly -- I&#39;m interested in the class more for the fun of the<br/>\nexperience together and with other kids than for the music education, though<br/>\nif we get some of that that&#39;s great, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo broaden the topic a bit, how do you unschoolers feel in general about<br/>\n&quot;extracurricular&quot; such as Girls Scouts, 4-H, gymnastics classes, art<br/>\nclasses, etc. The last thing I want to do is clutter up our schedule, but,<br/>\nfor us, it seems the occasional class would give us some variety, plus give<br/>\nus a chance to be together with some of the other kids in our area and<br/>\ndevelop some friendships. We are very rural and friendship opportunities do<br/>\nneed to be created; we can&#39;t just go out and play with the neighborhood<br/>\nkids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any information,<br/>\n<br/>\nAshley Harvie &#39;79</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"sdQ4C1kA6NU52a6qvxyV6irI_qYQQid2ls2fNJ0im1W1jeEP8nFUz1Vm6JeLkK1gn9I9nKk3SWqjzV89NQQuPu7et6bzROlkUqIaGIWwvIxq7gbhyA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 898","postDate":"977259111","msgId":14663,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBM0ZDQTY3LjI3NzczLjVDOUY5REBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PGZiLmYyNmQ1YjEuMjc3MDBjYWFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":14623,"nextInTopic":14664,"prevInTime":14662,"nextInTime":14664,"topicId":14623,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The new edition of Three in a Bed (and I seem to remember something in Do Not Disturb, I was forewarned before I read CC *grin) might have something, I haven t","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-652065701\">The new edition of Three in a Bed (and I seem to <br/>\nremember something in Do Not Disturb, I was forewarned <br/>\nbefore I read CC *grin) might have something, I haven&#39;t <br/>\nread it through yet.
