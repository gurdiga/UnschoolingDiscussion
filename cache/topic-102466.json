Something really cool about having your tunes handy for any <br/>\nsituation!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought the soprano ocarina from Songbird and it sounds lovely. <br/>\nI&#39;ve really been wanting the little silver pendant one. I bet it&#39;s <br/>\nhard to get your fingers on those teensy holes though.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone ever heard of &quot;puny tunes&quot;? This guy made up his own <br/>\nlittle instrument which is a tiny wood flute,  like a mix between a <br/>\nrecorder and an ocarina and called them Puny Tunes. He doesn&#39;t sell <br/>\nthem anymore, but a friend of mine gave me one...it&#39;s really cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102464,"nextTopicId":102465}}
