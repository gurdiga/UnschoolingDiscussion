I think part of the point was to make people think about<br/>\nteenage conformity and non-comformity.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkellig is just...  very interesting!  I cried at parts of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI belong to an adult book club.  We read a children&#39;s book about once a<br/>\nyear, and have discussed both Harry Potter and Stargirl there.  We read Snow<br/>\nFalling on Cedars, by David Guterson, who also wrote a homeschooling book<br/>\ncalled Family Matters.  Anyway, I later heard that Snow Falling on Cedars<br/>\nwas banned in a Texas high school because of the sex in it and my first<br/>\nthought was what sex?  Then I remembered that there were a couple of minor<br/>\nsex scenes, but they were such a small part of the story and both took place<br/>\nbetween willing partners who really cared for each other.   They just didn&#39;t<br/>\nstand out to me in my reading of the story.  It is an excellent book by the<br/>\nway, and deals with Japenese internment in America during WWII and takes<br/>\nplace in the San Juan Islands on America&#39;s and Canada&#39;s West Coasts.   One<br/>\nof women in my book club commented that when she was a teen, she went out of<br/>\nher way to read banned books.  She wanted to see what they were trying to<br/>\nkeep from her.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69205,"nextTopicId":69220}}
