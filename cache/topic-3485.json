It is the same as asking &quot;What is the<br/>\ndifference between being Buddhist and being Atheist, being Hindu and being<br/>\nAthiest, being (Any religion) and being Atheist?&quot;  Atheism is the denial of<br/>\nthe existance of dieties or the existence of divine beings.  Coming from a<br/>\nChristian perspective, one might take it to mean that if you are not<br/>\nChristian or do not believe in the Christian version of God, then you are<br/>\nnothing.  I will give you the benefit of the doubt however, and just assume<br/>\nthat you were confused as to the meaning of atheism.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPaganism is a religion, or I should say that the term refers to many<br/>\nreligions, with dieties, beliefs, traditions, holidays, symbols and<br/>\nsymbolism, a rich history and a thriving modern community.  Paganism can<br/>\nrefer to many things, including modern Druidism, revering the Norse Gods,<br/>\nVoodooism, Shamanism, Native American traditions, Native African religions,<br/>\nor any religious traditions that are stemming from ancient practices.<br/>\nChristianity and it&#39;s offshoots are fairly new, when compared to so many<br/>\nother of the world&#39;s religious traditions.  As I said, there are as many<br/>\nways to be Pagan as there are Pagans.  Pagans are often said to follow the<br/>\n&quot;old religion&quot; or the &quot;old ways&quot; and many Pagans combine traditions and<br/>\npractices based on where they live and who they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolidays would also vary based on what type of Paganism you were talking<br/>\nabout.  Many follow natural cycles of the moon, sun, stars, seasons, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor us, Paganism means following the traditions of the old Celtic calendar<br/>\nand a mix of European traditions, as well as elements which have meaning<br/>\nfor us here in this land.  We worship both the Goddess and God in equally<br/>\nimportant roles.  Balance is a key factor, and reverence for the natural<br/>\nworld.  We respect the energy (life) in all things and in all beings.<br/>\nHolidays for us are the eight Sabbats that mark the Wheel of the Year:  <br/>\n<br/>\nImbolg (Candlemas) February 2nd: the Celebration of Lights in the Spring,<br/>\nrepresenting the strengthening spark of light beginning to pierce the gloom<br/>\nof winter.  Also this holiday has a fertility aspect for the coming spring.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Spring Equinox March 21st: the celebration of the realization of<br/>\nspring.  The Equinox, when night and day, light and darkness are equal is a<br/>\ntime to remember the place that both winter and summer, birth and death,<br/>\nlight and darkness, male and female aspects play in our life, (think<br/>\nying-yang from Asian tradition and you&#39;ll have the idea.)  It is a joyous<br/>\ntime full of new life as well as a reverent acknowlegment of the importance<br/>\nof balance in our lives and in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nBealtaine (May Day, May Eve)April 30th: the beginning of summer, and<br/>\nlooking forward to the realization of the bounty of summer. Rekindling the<br/>\n&quot;Bel-fire&quot; of summer (symbolized by lighting candles or a fire) honoring<br/>\nhouse &quot;Lares&quot; or house icons/spirits/etc and in general celebrating the<br/>\nnewly fertile and renewing world.  Maypoles play into this celebration.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMidsummer (Summer Solstice) June 22nd: the time when the sun is at it&#39;s<br/>\ngreatest power, the longest day and shortest night of the year.  This is<br/>\nthe apex of light and warmth, and a celebration of abundance.  This is also<br/>\na time to remeber, in the warmth and abundance, that the days will be<br/>\nsuccessively shorter henceforth, so this is also the first herald of the<br/>\ncold season (themes of balance are recurring in all the Sabbats.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLughnasadh (Lammas) July 31st: a time of symbolic death and rebirth, the<br/>\nfirst of the two Harvest celebrations.  This is the reverence and<br/>\nacknowledgment of the harvest time, the bounty of spring and summer in<br/>\nfuition.  Fertility and the fullness of life are celebrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAutumn Equinox (Mabon) September 21st: like the Spring Equinox, this is the<br/>\ntime when Light and Dark are equal, so it is a time of balance.  The Spring<br/>\nEquinox might be described in aspect as the athlete poised for action after<br/>\nwinter, while Autumn equinox might be described as rest after labor.  The<br/>\nHarvest has been gathered in and is now complete.  It is a time of<br/>\nthankfullness for the bounty of the warm months and rest and preperation<br/>\n(mentally, spiritually, physically) for the leaner months ahead.  It is a<br/>\ntime for changing gears into cold season mode.<br/>\n<br/>\nRounding out the calendar of the eight Sabbats are Samhain and Yule, which<br/>\nI ppreviously described.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3528,"nextTopicId":3541}}
