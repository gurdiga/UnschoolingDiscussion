While DH and I were relaxing on the warm rocks on the beach, our 2 daughters were searching through the rocks picking out the best ones.  Then they went through the baggage searching for a receptacle to put their rock treasures in.  Then that evening after dinner, they presented their Mother&#39;s Day gift to me!  The most beautiful rocks they could find that were polished  and rounded by the waves!  That was my most special Mother&#39;s Day gift!  And I still have them and take them out and look at the precious gems from time to time!<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21191,"nextTopicId":21034}}
