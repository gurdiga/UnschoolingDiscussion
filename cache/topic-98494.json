I&#39;m only 5 foot,<br/>\nbut I was very underweight.  I don&#39;t think I had an actual eating disorder,<br/>\nbut easily could have.  Forcing kids to eat is a power play.  I learned<br/>\nevery trick in the book to hide food or feed it to the dog.  My parents try<br/>\nthat garbage with my son, and I tell them that he eats what he wants.  They<br/>\ndon&#39;t try to force him like they did me, but they try all of those<br/>\nmanipulative tricks on him.  He tells them &quot;I&#39;M DONE, LEAVE ME ALONE&quot;.<br/>\nWhenever they would take him somewhere or watch him for a few hours, the<br/>\nfirst thing she tells me is what he ate.  It makes me crazy.  He is also<br/>\nvery small for his age and skinny.  My mom was so obsessed about his weight<br/>\nwhen he was a baby.  Granted, he was a preemie and was very very small, so<br/>\nit was hard not to.  It drove her crazy that he was breastfed and I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nmeasure the amount he was getting.  Then, it drove her crazy that I let him<br/>\nnurse whenever he cried.   They were so into the power struggles for<br/>\neverything, sleeping, eating, potty training (hate that word).  We went in<br/>\nthe complete opposite direction with everything.  Craziness does not have to<br/>\nheredity!<br/>\nLaura J</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98194,"nextTopicId":98517}}
