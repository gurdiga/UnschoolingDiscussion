However, there IS<br/>\n real &quot;witch craft&quot; and it is a vehicle for Satan to use. Spiritual<br/>\n warfare is very real. I have  experienced it first hand within myself, and I<br/>\n have watched both my immediate and extended families go through it. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe in Satan, I don&#39;t believe in hell. I&#39;ve seen the kind of things your &quot;first hand experience&quot; get people all excited about, and all I see is natural (and sometimes unhealthy) human behavior causing all the problems.<br/>\nPeople need to blame evil entities in order to explain things, but that doesn&#39;t have anything to do with my point...which was about real witches.<br/>\nI know real witches, I know practicing wicca members.<br/>\nNot ONE of them seems in any way worshipful of anything remotely evil. Actually, they are very peaceable, earthy folks, interested in environmentalism and connections to the earth.<br/>\nLet&#39;s just assume Satan is real for a moment.<br/>\nThe Bible says he will be seen &quot;as an angel of light&quot;, not exactly the demonic version most Christians ascribe to.<br/>\nAnd if a person is using their intentions to bring about GOOD in this world, if their religious path is all about being positive and being a better person and helping others, how on earth could THAT be a vehicle for Satan? <br/>\n<br/>\nI see witchcraft the same as I do all religious ju-ju. The true power comes from within each of us. We all have great power to do wonderful things with our lives. Our positive thoughts and intentions can bring those very things into our lives (energy attracting energy). So whether one uses spells, or prayers or meditations or some other ju-ju, it&#39;s all coming from within us. <br/>\nWe need not fear our own greatness and power, we can embrace it and create lives that create happiness and joy that spills over to everyone around us.<br/>\nFear of witches or witchcraft will not help your children love other human beings. It will help them separate things into neat little boxes (Christian/not-Christian) and that inhibits true learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen, who dabbled with witchcraft as a teen and certainly did not end up being a witch!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.&quot;<br/>\nAlbert Einstein</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89347,"nextTopicId":89387}}
