And I personally never want to <br/>\nhear that particular song again. I have to admit though we did have a good <br/>\ntime, and I absolutely love to hear her real laugh.

Kearstin has many interests, she goes back<br/>\n&gt; and forth(she likes that ;) ) Right now she is trying to raise a baby<br/>\nturtle<br/>\n&gt; that she found. This has been alot of fun for all of actually , even Daddy<br/>\n&gt; kicked in his expertise. But this is the first time in awhile that she has<br/>\n&gt; gotten excited about something and she is already getting bored , the poor<br/>\n&gt; turtle doesnt roll over , play dead , fetch, and damn it he refuses to get<br/>\n&gt; the paper. We (hubby and I) spent alot of money housing this turtle and<br/>\nspent<br/>\n&gt; hours reading about what to do with it and now I think he will be orphaned<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;grandparents&quot; thats what she calls us. She would love to sew I think<br/>\n.<br/>\n&gt; Ill have to look into that. , as far as is she interested in any specific<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; the t.v. , no I dont think so , she mostly seems to be vegging. I have sat<br/>\n&gt; with her and try to see what she sees but you see I am at a disadvantage a<br/>\n&gt; big one . I hate t.v. , always have, I would rather have my face stuck in<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; book. she watches with her Dad alot. and they seem to laugh alot. I havent<br/>\n&gt; quit figured out why. Dont get me wrong I will watch t.v. occasionally and<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; will laugh too but only at cartoons LOL. and usually not more that a 1/2<br/>\n&gt; hour. Give me a book almost any book and Ill disappear and forget<br/>\neverything<br/>\n&gt; around me.<br/>\n&gt; As far as doing things for me , I definately do. We have two horses and I<br/>\n&gt; spend alot of time at the barn, she really has no interest.That kills me<br/>\n&gt; because when I was a kid I would have done anything for a horse.I dont<br/>\npush<br/>\n&gt; it on her she does her own thing when were there. She does have a thing<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; rocks.   ???

When I asked her what she was doing she got her little sheepish grin<br/>\n&gt; and says she likes to see all the different colors that the rock has.

Kearstin has many interests, she goes back <br/>\nand forth(she likes that ;) ) Right now she is trying to raise a baby turtle <br/>\nthat she found. This has been alot of fun for all of actually , even Daddy <br/>\nkicked in his expertise. But this is the first time in awhile that she has <br/>\ngotten excited about something and she is already getting bored , the poor <br/>\nturtle doesnt roll over , play dead , fetch, and damn it he refuses to get <br/>\nthe paper. We (hubby and I) spent alot of money housing this turtle and spent <br/>\nhours reading about what to do with it and now I think he will be orphaned to <br/>\nthe &quot;grandparents&quot; thats what she calls us. She would love to sew I think . <br/>\nIll have to look into that. , as far as is she interested in any specific on <br/>\nthe t.v. , no I dont think so , she mostly seems to be vegging. I have sat <br/>\nwith her and try to see what she sees but you see I am at a disadvantage a <br/>\nbig one . I hate t.v. , always have, I would rather have my face stuck in a <br/>\nbook. she watches with her Dad alot. and they seem to laugh alot. I havent <br/>\nquit figured out why. Dont get me wrong I will watch t.v. occasionally and I <br/>\nwill laugh too but only at cartoons LOL. and usually not more that a 1/2 <br/>\nhour. Give me a book almost any book and Ill disappear and forget everything <br/>\naround me. <br/>\nAs far as doing things for me , I definately do. We have two horses and I <br/>\nspend alot of time at the barn, she really has no interest.That kills me <br/>\nbecause when I was a kid I would have done anything for a horse.I dont push <br/>\nit on her she does her own thing when were there. She does have a thing for <br/>\nrocks.   ??? Im not sure what her thing is yet but she can spend hours <br/>\nsitting on this little hill and she has one of my horse brushes and her &quot;rock <br/>\nhammer&quot; and she crushes them then brushes them off then crushes them some <br/>\nmore. When I asked her what she was doing she got her little sheepish grin <br/>\nand says she likes to see all the different colors that the rock has.

The arts<br/>\nand crafts that someone mentioned can counteract that,<br/>\nand you can watch a movie at the same time.  You can<br/>\nrewind, if you get thirsty or something.

If you would like to share specifics some more,<br/>\nI&#39;m not adverse to talking off list. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;ll be OK.....but sounds like you need something<br/>\nfor yourself!! What do YOU like to do?  Just do it. <br/>\nShe can&#39;t help but be interested, even if it does just<br/>\nseem nosey, at first.

Then just as school <br/>\nwas about to start I got nervous because my daughter wasnt doing anything ( I <br/>\nknow , I know I should have left her alone) so I spent the money to sign her <br/>\nup for Laurel Springs because I thought she needed the structure (ahem)  We <br/>\nused that curriculum and it was good I thought , but the battles ........Need <br/>\nI say more? We more or less wasted our money because 90% of the materials <br/>\nwent unused and now I feel like a failure for not following through with <br/>\nanything Unschooling or schooling. I have tried to lay off of her as I feel <br/>\nit is my fault for not being consistant. We have not done any school work at <br/>\nall since aroung Feb. vaca. ( I notice this seems to be our cut off point) <br/>\nI have so many things going on in my head , I dont know what is right or <br/>\nwrong any more. I seriously considered putting her back in school for 5th <br/>\ngrade, my husband strongly against this , he feels that she has been out of <br/>\nschool for too long and is afraid she will have the shock of her life when <br/>\nshe gets there. Also he does not want to undo what we HAVE accomplished with <br/>\nher. As far as what she wants , I have asked her if she would like to go <br/>\nback. She goes back and forth with it , she likes the idea of having so many <br/>\nkids around and the music concerts and the not feeling alone part (shes an <br/>\nonly child and there are no support groups around) But to actually go back to <br/>\nschool for school she doesnt like that at all. So I have not pushed the issue <br/>\nwith her ,but for myself I am driving myself crazy. At one point I had it all <br/>\nset in my head that she was definately going back. Let me tell you the <br/>\nfeelings and thoughts that saved me from that. First I felt relieved, as you <br/>\nall know homeschooling is a way of life therefore it is on my mind 24/7 I was <br/>\nrunning out of ideas and was sick of being worried about if I was doing it <br/>\nright or not.<br/>\nSecond I felt sad that I was giving up on her. (not on her part , on mine)<br/>\nThird I was mad at myself for not being strong enough, creative enough, <br/>\npatient enough.<br/>\nFourth., I was scared, of what would  school do to her. the kids the teachers <br/>\nthe STRUCTURE. <br/>\nThen finally I decided that I just cant do it. I cannot send her back to <br/>\nschool. Period. <br/>\nMy bestfriend whom I trust implicitly with my feelings and I have had some <br/>\nreal good arguments about the fact that she is missing out on so much(her <br/>\nthoughts ,not mine) we have finally agreed to disagree . All of her kids are <br/>\nvery popular and straight A students. You know the type , and dont get me <br/>\nwrong I am happy for her and her kids. I always encourage them and talk <br/>\n&quot;school&quot; with them. Because it makes them happy. okay enough of that. <br/>\nMy point is I am back to Unschooling. I know about the deschooling part of <br/>\nit, and I think she has been deschooling, doing whatever comes along and such.<br/>\nThe child is a t.v. addict and I have completely laid off when it comes to <br/>\nthese things feeling that soon or later she will get bored and find something <br/>\nto do. NOT. I swear sometimes I can see the brain cells floating off towards <br/>\nthe set. (that was supposed to be a joke) <br/>\nEvery one I know is giving me a hard time about , Im not tough enough on her <br/>\n, she has no structure. She has no bedtime. She sleeps late in the <br/>\nmorning(what kind of a life is that for a child, hehee) Sometimes I can laugh <br/>\nat that and sometimes it really bothers me.<br/>\nSometimes you can see the fact that she hasnt learned what the school kids <br/>\nhave and sometimes you would never know. ( This in itself does not bother me <br/>\n, the fact that it bothers my family and my close friends does. They cannot <br/>\nnot see the big picture , they do not have any clue as to what I am trying to <br/>\nget done.) Sometimes I can look going to the bank as a learning experience <br/>\nother times I scoff and say who am I kidding she hasnt heard a word you have <br/>\nsaid. Sometimes she fools me and she has!! Alot of times she has not.<br/>\nIm afraid that if I dont bring things up she will  miss it. Im afraid if I <br/>\nlet my guard down and just live then she wont learn anything.  It must work <br/>\nso many of you do it and your kids are learning. Some of them are <br/>\noverlearning or over achievers . I keeep waiting for that. It has not come <br/>\nyet. I keep my mouth shut. and I encourage her as often as possible. I keep <br/>\nthinking just how much t.v. can she watch , how long can she play that <br/>\ngameboy. She seems bored out of her mind ,but says she isnt. When I walk into <br/>\nthe room and she is watching t.v. or playing her gameboy, I quickly go away <br/>\nand try to keep myself busy to keep from saying something like &quot;You are <br/>\nwatching t.v. again. &quot; well something to that effect. When she gets excited <br/>\nthat she just got to the next level on her gameboy. I do try to encourage <br/>\nthat and get excited for her. (sometimes that is a small feat for me)<br/>\nI am sorry this is so long and kind of jumbled , but I had to get it out and <br/>\nI had to talk to someone who is not going to tell me I am ruining her life. I <br/>\nhad to get some answers from someone.
