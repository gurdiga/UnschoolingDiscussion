When I was <br/>\nlittle, there was a book in our school&#39;s library about the history of <br/>\nlanguage and writing, and I bought one from scholastic books for 35 cents or <br/>\nso in 4th grade.  Had it for years.  Might still have it, come to think of <br/>\nit.  They stapled them in the early 60&#39;s. so they stay together better than <br/>\n&quot;perma bound&quot; (glued to paper) pages.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor myself, I have a dozen or twenty books about English trivia, development, <br/>\nand such.  But none that would appeal to kids, and I can&#39;t list titles <br/>\nbecause they&#39;re a flight and a half of stairs from me and my wheelchair.   IN <br/>\nJANUARY I will see my library again. &lt;g&gt;  (Probably December.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was teaching Jr. High, instead of a textbook we used paperbacks of the <br/>\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary which has lots of word origins, and we played a <br/>\ngame (A LOT) where someone would name a word and I (at first, and soon kids) <br/>\nwould guess what language it came from.  In no time, it&#39;s not &quot;guessing,&quot; <br/>\nit&#39;s knowing.  That lead to the fun of tracking down the oddities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the backs of those dictionaries is the &quot;Indo European Roots appendix&quot; and <br/>\nwith that they show how some of the oldest words, like &quot;book&quot; and &quot;ship&quot; are <br/>\nrelated to so many other languages, and what the sound seems to REALLY <br/>\noriginally have indicated.  Winter is a good one too, related to &quot;water,&quot; <br/>\nalthough that&#39;s not apparent in English.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo just playing with dictionaries (or online etymological sites) is fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like anything else, I think instead of making a unit study of something, <br/>\njust becoming open to learning more about it for the rest of your life is <br/>\ngood enough. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t binge.  I BINGE!   A friend in England sent her <br/>\ndaughter here to spend time with grandparents and friends.  There was a <br/>\nschedule.  She was with us for three days.  It was very efficient.  But <br/>\nanyway, gifts were sent.  I got books from thrift stores.  A 1950s imprint of <br/>\nSeven Years in Tibet.  I just finished it this morning.  While I was reading <br/>\nit, I kept looking things up on the web, I watched the movie again, read <br/>\ncommentary about the movie, and talked to various friends about what I was <br/>\nreading.   So although it was immersion, in a way, I&#39;ll keep adding to my <br/>\nknowledge of those days for the rest of my life (or until Alzheimer&#39;s <br/>\ndistracts me).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an SCA-focussed article which might be of use to a few people here, <br/>\nthough.
