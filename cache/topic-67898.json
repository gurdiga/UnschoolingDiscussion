The one we saw was hunting for a muskrat.  It was wonderful to<br/>\nwitness all of this first hand  _ I kept thinking if the kids were in<br/>\nschool right now they&#39;d miss all of this!!  :)   It looked like a fisher<br/>\nto me but seemed small for one.  Maybe a runt?  &lt;g&gt; What I have come to<br/>\nknow about fisher cats is they are making a comeback and have been found<br/>\ncloser to residential areas now.  They are neat to see but do lock up<br/>\nyour cats at night - the fishers will kill them or any other small<br/>\nanimal around.  <br/>\n We are in MA, Heather where in CT are you ? <br/>\nHave fun!
