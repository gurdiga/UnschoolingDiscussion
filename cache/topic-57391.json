Now they  have their own other avenues for finding <br/>\nmovies, or recommendations from friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve watched movies with all of them variously about things I never would <br/>\nhave watched on my own, and had lots of fun.  One was about snowboarders and <br/>\nthe resort&#39;s being taken over by an evil Texan (or some such).   Teenage boy <br/>\nhumor, mostly, but some great stunts and funny gags.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly asked me to look on Netflix for a movie she had seen called <br/>\n&quot;babysitting in the city&quot; or something, she said.  I just searched for <br/>\nbabysitting and told her her choices.  It was &quot;Adventures in Babysitting.&quot;  <br/>\nIt was FUN!   I started watching it with Keith last night, after we watched <br/>\nPatriot Games (too violent for my tastes).  My foot&#39;s sore, and Keith was <br/>\nsoaking an ingrown toenail.  So we two aging parents were watching videos <br/>\ntogether.  And so we put that one in.  Holly came home from a trip to the <br/>\nmall with a teenaged friend of hers and I went to bed, while Holly watched <br/>\nthe rest of the kid-adventure movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of those movies were art films.  They weren&#39;t about historical <br/>\nperiods (well, the 1980&#39;s as a historical period, in the latter maybe).  <br/>\nThere was good music in both.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the best part was that the adults were participating with and paying <br/>\nclose attention to things the kids had liked or wanted to see.  And our going <br/>\ninto their world and communicating and communing was more important than <br/>\nwhich movie it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother movie Holly brought home after seeing it elsewhere was the one about <br/>\nthe young pregnant woman who is abandoned at a WalMart--Where the Heart Is, I <br/>\nthink.  It did NOT sound interesting when she told me about it, but because <br/>\nHolly was so enthusiastic, I watched it to see what had so sparked her <br/>\ninterest.  I COULD have said I didn&#39;t want to see it, because in many <br/>\nrational and logical ways I didn&#39;t want to.  But I pressed myself to watch it <br/>\nbecause I really love Holly.  And she was right, and I was wrong.  It was a <br/>\ngood movie, and we had great conversations because of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] how to include my son","postDate":"1044031119","msgId":57399,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMTMxMTYzODM5LjcyOTkwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE1OC4xYjI4ZjUzOS4yYjZiZmJkN0Bjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":57391,"nextInTopic":57629,"prevInTime":57398,"nextInTime":57400,"topicId":57391,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I probably just need to lay off.
