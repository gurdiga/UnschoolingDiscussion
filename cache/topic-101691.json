People will come over with fast food and walk in the house!  <br/>\nUnder certain gamer-circumstances, it&#39;s not so bad, but generally it&#39;s insanely <br/>\ntreating a person&#39;s house as though it were a public park with a picnic <br/>\ntable, or like a parking lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- And then the next time &quot;What happened with Johnny? It <br/>\nseems like he really needs your help. Everyone is taking care of <br/>\ntheir own kids since my daughter is with her friends.&quot; Etc.  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there were a next time, I would tell Johnny &quot;Go sit with your mom,&quot; and <br/>\nwhen I got to the mom would say &quot;You need to stay with Johnny.&quot;   I wouldn&#39;t.  <br/>\nShe could stay with him at my house or take him to her house.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the problem is that those who are problematical are often those who <br/>\nare lacking social skills and as there&#39;s a genetic component, the parents might <br/>\nbe similarly lacking.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had a friend who was like an asocial bull in a social china shop, but she <br/>\nnever felt bad or embarrassed because she didn&#39;t seem to perceive that element <br/>\nof life on earth.  In a meeting, she would close her eyes and then interrupt, <br/>\ntalking with her eyes closed.  No point could be made with her without the <br/>\nperson being blunt to the point of cruelty, and THEN maybe she would take it the <br/>\nway others take very tactful little hints.  Statements that would have turned <br/>\nme to crying goo were met with &quot;Oh.  Sorry.  I didn&#39;t think about that; <br/>\nthanks,&quot; and a smile, and an attempt to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo just as one wouldn&#39;t invite the tone deaf to sing madrigals nor the <br/>\nstumble-footed to play soccer, just don&#39;t invite the socially inept to social <br/>\nparties.  Ceremonies (weddings, baptisms, funerals), fine.  Those are rarely in <br/>\nprivate homes anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101666,"nextTopicId":101701}}
