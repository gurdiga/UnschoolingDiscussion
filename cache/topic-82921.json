A special Eye on America investigation<br/>\nonly on Monday&#39;s CBS Evening News.” The following is from home school<br/>\nleaders in North Carolina: “Following discussions that Hal Young, the<br/>\npresident of NCHE (North Carolina Home Educators), had on Friday with<br/>\nthe CBS Evening News producer, it is anticipated that CBS will be<br/>\nrunning a 2 part series on Monday & Tuesday evening on Homeschooling<br/>\n(The report is already complete, but be mindful that other news may<br/>\npossibly preempt it). “This report is expected to focus on the handful<br/>\nof child abuse cases over the past 5 to 10 years involving ‘presumed<br/>\nhomeschoolers’ including the murder/suicide of ‘Non homeschooled<br/>\nhomeschoolers’ in Johnston County, NC two years ago. The CBS reporters<br/>\nwill be highlighting various murders, suicides, etc. involving<br/>\n‘homeschoolers’ nationwide and will attempt to argue that ‘Homeschooling<br/>\nis out of control’. The woman producer stated directly to Hal that he<br/>\n‘would not be pleased with the report’, and that the intent of the<br/>\nreport is to encourage further state and federal government regulation<br/>\nof homeschooling.” THSC will take a proactive position on this issue, as<br/>\nwe have in the past. Texas home schoolers should be aware of this issue<br/>\nand be prepared to respond. Following are some points that should be<br/>\nmade concerning filicide and home schooling. * Filicide is not rare.<br/>\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI filicide is not<br/>\nuncommon. In fact, an article by the Houston Chronicle in 2001, made the<br/>\nsame point. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/topstory/950318)\">http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/topstory/950318)</a> *<br/>\nHomeschooling has grown dramatically over the last twenty-five years,<br/>\nbut filicide has decreased or is flat; it has not increased. Therefore,<br/>\nit would seem that there is no connection. * While filicide is not<br/>\nuncommon, it appears that the education of the children is rarely an<br/>\nissue unless the family is home schooling. A specific Texas example is<br/>\nthe case of Darlie Routier in Rowlett, near Dallas, a few years ago. In<br/>\nthat high profile case, the mother was convicted of murdering two of her<br/>\nthree sons while her husband slept. The education of the children was<br/>\nnever an issue. As this issue is raised, Texas home school leaders<br/>\nshould stay on message with the points above and maintain that everyone<br/>\nis horrified at every instance of filicide, but this is not an education<br/>\nissue. Those who support state regulation of home education should not<br/>\nuse such travesties to support a political agenda.<br/>\n<br/>\nFREE SUBSCRIPTION TO THSC REVIEW Texas Home School Coalition REVIEW<br/>\nmagazine is advertiser supported and FREE to Texas home educators.
