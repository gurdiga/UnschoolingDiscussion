Does the Peregrine really look like a Peregrine?   Are the<br/>\ncolors right for the birds that are identified?    If so, then  what is<br/>\nthe beak and tail shape like and the leg color of the bird you haven&#39;t<br/>\nidentified?<br/>\nHarris&#39;s Hawk has red wings, but the white breast is wrong, they are<br/>\ndark.  They have a white rump and white band at their tail.   Juveniles<br/>\nhave a lighter streaked breast.<br/>\nLastly, if the other birds look somewhat like the bird they are claiming<br/>\nto be, check the country in which your kit was made and do an Internet<br/>\nsearch for common birds in that country.   American guides list very few<br/>\nvagrants from other countries. <br/>\nGood luck!   Let us know if you find it!    It&#39;s possible it&#39;s just a<br/>\nmade up bird... <br/>\nWhere did you get your kit?    Can you call the company and ask?   Not<br/>\nthat they would know...<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nOn Sun, 24 Nov 2002 13:27:01 +0000 &quot;elaine greenwood-hyde&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elainegh8@...\">elainegh8@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;    we&#39;re trying to identify a bird that may be an Anerican species. <br/>\n&gt; It has a <br/>\n&gt; white breast, red wings and a blue or possibly black head.
