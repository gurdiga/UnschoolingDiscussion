She couldn&#39;t read before and <br/>\nphonics just made big tears.  I couldn&#39;t stand them.  She reads now.  She <br/>\nstarted really reading at 12.  I stopped all phonics and reading lessons at nine. <br/>\nI wasn&#39;t sure if she could ever read well or not.  Now she speed reads.  She <br/>\ndoes very well.  And she is spelling too.  Why?  Because she wants her friends <br/>\nto know what she has to say when she im&#39;s them or emails them.  Because I <br/>\nallow her to play on neopets as long as she wants, and she wants to know how to <br/>\nspell because she wants people to go to her shop.  Caitlin can&#39;t really read <br/>\nyet.  She is doing neopets too and wants to now.  She is 11 and I am pretty sure <br/>\nshe will read.  Caitlin has had a problem with alot of reversal of letters and <br/>\nnumbers.  Typing helps unless she puts the word out totally backwards.  But <br/>\nshe is starting to see it when she does it.  Frankie can only read words that <br/>\npertain to codes and games.  LOL words like all weapons, and lots of money or <br/>\nlife.  Not really but those words interest him.  He can read Harry the dirty <br/>\ndog and other Harry books because he loves them.  We both love goose bump books. <br/>\n Books I used to ban my oldest son from.  He&#39;s 9 going on 10.  I fret <br/>\nsometimes but I don&#39;t want to affect them with my fretting so I keep it to myself.  <br/>\nThey are fine.  I am the one that is not fine LOL.  I keep reading this list <br/>\nand learning.  We live in Fl so now is the time for all parents to panic because <br/>\nevaluations are due.  I hate those things.  I&#39;m wanting someone that is unsch<br/>\nooling friendly.  Does anyone know anyone that is truly unschooling friendly <br/>\nthat has a teachers certificate??
