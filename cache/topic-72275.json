My daughter Casey only went to one year of preschool and <br/>\na tiny specilaized Kindergarten program. She&#39;s 9 now.<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Do you have high schoolers or have you &quot;graduated&quot; high schoolers?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Conor would be considered high school age for the upcoming school <br/>\nyear. But we don&#39;t do school years and we won&#39;t do high school. He&#39;ll <br/>\ncontinue on the path of following his interests and learning for the <br/>\nsake of knowledge, not to pass a course. He won&#39;t graduate because he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t consider learning something that should ever end. He is <br/>\nconsidering Community College at some point during his teen years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;My ds is just beginning to HS. He was in the 7th grade butwould <br/>\n </span></blockquote>like to skip the 8th grade and move on tothe 9th. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s home now. Why not skip the grades altogether and move on to the <br/>\nlearning? He (and you) will need time to deschool and get used to <br/>\nlearning in freedom. Have either of you read The Teenage Liberation <br/>\nHandbook by Grace Lewellyn? Lots of great ideas for teens in there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He is very smart but...&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Forget the but. Leave it at &quot;He is very smart.&quot; School is not real <br/>\nlife. What he will do from now on is his real life. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I have tried to be flexible with my 7th grader,  but I do tryto get <br/>\n </span></blockquote>him to do some &quot;school work&quot;. He goes back and forth between wanting <br/>\nme to give him assignments and telling me I am too pushey. I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink he is sure what he wants. He certainly has me confused.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is learning totally removed from school. Your son has <br/>\nonly known school, so he doesn&#39;t remember what learning outside the <br/>\nsystem is like. That may even be true for you as well. I would <br/>\nsuggest you keep reading here, read at the unschooling.com website <br/>\nand also at sandradodd.com. You&#39;ll have lots of time this summer <br/>\nwhere you won&#39;t feel you have to worry about &quot;schooling&quot; him.
