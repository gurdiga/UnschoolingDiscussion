I use the research to point out that home-educated children outperform","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1539258229\">Hello all<br/>\nthis point comes up alot when I try to explain our way of life to others.  I<br/>\nuse the research to point out that home-educated children outperform their<br/>\nschooled peers in just about everything.  But my belief in &quot;unschooling&#39;<br/>\nmeans that I often do not teach them anything.  I am here to help them live<br/>\ntheir lives the way they want, not treating childhood as a training ground<br/>\nfor adulthood.  I find it distressing when people unschool as long as their<br/>\nchildren are doing things that they approve of, or doing lots of academic<br/>\nstuff, but then become strict and stifling as soon as it appears that the<br/>\nchildren are going in their own direction.  That people sometimes talk about<br/>\nunschooling as a teaching method is ridiculous. That people think<br/>\nunschooling is okay as long as you have children who are accomplishing<br/>\nthings also disturbs me.  I know of children who do not read, but are read<br/>\nto, and they have immense thinking abilities.  I know children who are<br/>\namazing who have never done anything but play Magic and Playstation and<br/>\nother war games.  I know children who are thought of as slow, but their<br/>\nparents dedication to unschooling meant that it was not as issue, and one<br/>\nday they woke up and wanted to do exams and go to university (and did).  I<br/>\nthink that the use of the genius example has its place.  It helps to explain<br/>\nto outsiders, it helps many of us to see that our children are not going to<br/>\nsuffer BECAUSE they are home- educated, but it does often undremine our<br/>\nconfidence in ourselves and our children to read about all of these<br/>\nexceptional people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember hearing John Taylor Gatto talk at a conference in London.  He<br/>\nused the word &quot;miracle&quot; to describe young people who had accomplished much<br/>\nwhile they were young, settign up businesses etc.  The problem is that it<br/>\nisn&#39;t a miracle.  So many young people would accomplish so much if they were<br/>\nnot held back by institutions and people who force them to live lives<br/>\naccording to external motivation.  But wehter or not WE see them as<br/>\naccomplishing much is not the point.  It is whether or not THEY feel that<br/>\nthey have accomplished something that is important.  Winning the regional<br/>\nPokemon tournement may not be held up by home-educators as  great an<br/>\naccomplishment as winning the regional spelling bee, but that is not for us<br/>\nto decide. It is still a great accomplishment.  Finding the courage to<br/>\npartake when you know you are going to lose is equally great.<br/>\nI am beginning to ramble but I think my point is that achievemnt and success<br/>\nare only relevant according to our own personal goals.  To objectify them<br/>\nand use, money or status or academics as a measure of success only leads to<br/>\ndisatisfied human beings.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I really understand where you&#39;re coming from with your statement about<br/>\n&gt; home/unschoolers always wanting their children to excel or be seen as<br/>\n </span></blockquote>genius<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; material.

We have plenty of hand held<br/>\nintruments around. <br/>\n<br/>\nI see my dd who is very dramatic both in her<br/>\npersonality and her play. She likes to look herself in<br/>\nthe mirror and play with her facial expressions when<br/>\nshe is talking. So I often think oh acting for her<br/>\nmaybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when I see these things and think I am projecting<br/>\nor maybe not. Or I wanting something special/<br/>\nsomething to put my kids in a box to be something. Or<br/>\nmaybe its the trap up &quot;keeping up with the Jones&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGot any words of wisdom anyone?
