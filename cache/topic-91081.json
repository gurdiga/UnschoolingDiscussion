He says that he is supportive of <br/>\nunschooling but, whenever I bring up going to a conference, he <br/>\nalways has some reason as to why we shouldn&#39;t go.  However, this is <br/>\none that I just might go to without him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne question, my DD will be 3 by the time the conference rolls <br/>\naround and I would need to bring her with me.  I am not comfortable <br/>\nleaving her with people that I don&#39;t know (assuming that there is <br/>\nsome kind of daycare set up), would I be able to bring her to <br/>\nthe &quot;seminars&quot; with me?

In fact some of the <br/>\nnicest testamonials were from dads! They get to see older unschooled children and <br/>\ndads who &quot;get it&quot;. There will be a special &quot;Dads Only&quot; secret society where <br/>\nthey can talk freely about their concerns with other dads----with no moms to <br/>\nterrorize them and monopolize the conversations! &lt;g&gt; They can immerse themselves <br/>\nfor three days into unschooling and come out with a new understanding of <br/>\nunschooling-----and some have become downright (dare I say it????) evangelical! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the kids: they&#39;ll have a great time! There is no &quot;daycare&quot; as such <br/>\n(this IS an UNschooling conference, after all!), but I&#39;m sure Kathryn will have a <br/>\n&quot;safe room&quot; where the littluns can play safely with a parent nearby as we did <br/>\nbefore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d hightly recommend that the whole family come, BUT there is a handful of <br/>\nwomen who came without kids and had a blast. They are known as the &quot;ladies on <br/>\nthe terrace&quot;, as they spent most their free time outside with bottles of wine! <br/>\nThey DID complain to me last week, though, that their husband still don&#39;t get <br/>\nit. I recommended that they might should bring their husbands this year! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith or without husbands and/or children you will get a BUNCH out of this <br/>\nweekend. But as unschoolers, I&#39;d say that it&#39;s best as a family affair!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope to meet you (all) then!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91078,"nextTopicId":91083}}
