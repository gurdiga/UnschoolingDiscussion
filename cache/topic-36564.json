Weve been home schooling our children for 5 years.<br/>\nThis<br/>\nyear we enrolled them in Einstein Academy, and it was a disaster.<br/>\n <br/>\nBefore considering The Grace Academy, you should know that Mimi and Howie<br/>\nare<br/>\nEinsteins founders. Their company, Tutorbots, mismanaged the school<br/>\nuntil about<br/>\nthree weeks ago. In her dealings with Einstein families, Mimi used the<br/>\nname<br/>\nMimi Rothschild.<br/>\n <br/>\nIEPs were not done for the 300 special ed children who were enrolled in<br/>\nthe<br/>\nschool. It is now the end of April and only nine IEPs have been written.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have never seen a more substantive fundamental violation of special<br/>\neducation<br/>\nby a local education agency, charged Jane Sullivan, special education<br/>\nadviser<br/>\nfor the education department, who testified against Einstein Academy.<br/>\nCourier<br/>\nTimes 3/20/02<br/>\n <br/>\nThe curriculum was not what Einstein promised. One class didnt have a<br/>\nteacher<br/>\nuntil early Dec  then he left the school in February, and the class is<br/>\nteacherless<br/>\nagain. <br/>\n <br/>\nEinstein has been sued by many PA school districts and the PA Department<br/>\nof<br/>\nEducation. It is only open now through a court-brokered agreement which<br/>\nrequired:<br/>\neliminating Tutorbots as manager and financial manager of the school,<br/>\nforensic<br/>\naccounting of payments to Tutorbots, approval of all payments by a<br/>\ncomptroller<br/>\nwho reports to the chartering school district and strict oversight by the<br/>\nchartering<br/>\nschool district. <br/>\n <br/>\nHere are excerpts from articles about Tutorbots and its mismanagement of<br/>\nEinstein:<br/>\n <br/>\n************<br/>\n <br/>\nI am convinced that Einstein will not be successful as long as Tutorbots<br/>\nis<br/>\nthe management company, Ken Junkins, the Morrisville board president,<br/>\nsaid<br/>\nyesterday.<br/>\n <br/>\nI believe Tutorbots is not properly managing Einstein. I believe there<br/>\nis possible<br/>\nmismanagement of funds, and they are not responding appropriately to the<br/>\nneeds<br/>\nof students, he said.<br/>\nCourier Times 2/28/02<br/>\n <br/>\n**************<br/>\nWe believe they (Tutorbots) totally mishandled the management of the<br/>\nschool.<br/>\nSaid Morrisville Superintendent John M. Gould.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe school board, Gould said, is particularly concerned about Tutorbots<br/>\ngeneral<br/>\noperation of the school, a lack of fiscal oversight and problems<br/>\nproviding services<br/>\nto special education students.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnother source of Morrisvilles ire: Einsteins teachers havent been<br/>\npaid since<br/>\nearly February. We are quite angry at Tutorbots because they have used<br/>\n$2.3<br/>\nmillion to pay themselves but have not paid the teachers,  Gould said.<br/>\nThats<br/>\nunconscionable.<br/>\nMorning Call 3/2/02<br/>\n <br/>\n***************<br/>\nCourt documents showed that about $3 million was paid to Tutorbots during<br/>\nthe<br/>\nschool year, while teachers have gone unpaid and the schools internet<br/>\nservice<br/>\nprovider, Digital Freedom, canceled its service for nonpayment.<br/>\n <br/>\nOther complaints include copyright infringement, a lack of curriculum and<br/>\nteachers<br/>\nand a lack of special education services.<br/>\n <br/>\nDuring todays arguments, attorney Scher insisted that the state has a<br/>\nresponsibility<br/>\nto pay its bill owed the cyber school, some 15 million in all. The judge<br/>\nasked<br/>\nScher how the state would know that the money is not going to a bank in<br/>\nthe<br/>\nCayman Islands.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut from day one they (the state) funded you and you did virtually<br/>\nnothing,<br/>\nJudge Pellegrini said. You are supposed to be up and running on day one,<br/>\nnot<br/>\nday 90 of a 180-day school year. In effect, you put Tutorbots over the<br/>\ninterest<br/>\nof the children you were supposed to educate.<br/>\nLancaster New Era 3/22/02<br/>\n <br/>\n****************<br/>\nGould believes Mandel and Rothschild are controlling much of the schools<br/>\nspending.<br/>\n <br/>\nHowie Mandelhad the responsibility forapproving all invoices, Gould<br/>\nclaimed<br/>\nin a letter to Einstein, including invoices from his own company,<br/>\nTutorbots,<br/>\nand Gould said some of those invoices are grossly inflated<br/>\n <br/>\nAll this while other vendors, and even the schools teachers went unpaid.<br/>\n <br/>\nEinstein paid Tutorbots $2.4 million before paying teachers, Gould<br/>\nsaid. <br/>\n <br/>\nWGAL 3/26/02<br/>\n <br/>\n*****************<br/>\nour information is that Einstein has received $3.3 million from the<br/>\nCommonwealth<br/>\nof PA to fund its educational program. Our Business Administrator cannot<br/>\nconceive<br/>\nof any way that the funding to date would not be sufficient to allow<br/>\nEinstein<br/>\nto be current on its bills and meet payroll.<br/>\n <br/>\nMorrisville attorney <br/>\n <br/>\n*****************<br/>\nTutorbots Inc. is prohibited from providing any management or financial<br/>\nmanagement<br/>\nservices to Einstein. In addition, a forensic accounting firm will review<br/>\nall<br/>\npaid and outstanding invoices previously submitted by Tutorbots to<br/>\nEinstein<br/>\nto determine if they were properly paid and that the funds were used for<br/>\npurposes<br/>\npermitted under the Public School Code:<br/>\nPDE press release 3/28/02<br/>\n <br/>\n*****************<br/>\nIn June a forensic accounting firm will do an audit to determine whether<br/>\nthe<br/>\npayments Einstein made to Tutorbots were warranted. A total of $2.2<br/>\nmillion<br/>\nof $3.8 million in state funding that Einstein received went to<br/>\nTutorbots, and<br/>\nthe state Education Department wants to know why, said Beth Gaydos, a<br/>\nspokeswoman<br/>\nfor the Education Department.<br/>\nCourier Times 4/4/02<br/>\n <br/>\n****************<br/>\nThe computer problems coincide with a new legal battle between Einstein<br/>\nand<br/>\nTutorbots, which is demanding the repayment of a loan of about $345,000.<br/>\n <br/>\nTutorbots officials, Howard Mandell and his wife, Mimi Rothschild, also<br/>\nthe<br/>\nfounder of Einstein, have been withholding student records as well as<br/>\ncontrol<br/>\nof the schools web site, until the money is repaid.<br/>\n <br/>\nLast week, a judge in Philadelphia ordered the return of the records as<br/>\nwell<br/>\nas the web site, but as of Tuesday that had not happened.<br/>\nIntelligencer Journal 4/10/02<br/>\n <br/>\n*****************<br/>\n <br/>\nTutorbots mismanagement turned what could have been a great cyber school<br/>\ninto<br/>\na disaster which damaged children enrolled.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou should exercise great caution before considering The Grace Academy!<br/>\n <br/>\nBuyer Beware!<br/>\nElizabeth Stone<br/>\n<br/>\nClick here for more info:<br/>\nCyber School Flunking First Year<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/news/school/0,1383,51489,00.html\">http://www.wired.com/news/school/0,1383,51489,00.html</a><br/>\n <br/>\nThis email may be reproduced in its entirety and posted where<br/>\nappropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nThe above was written in response to this email sent to many homeschool<br/>\negroups...<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Mon, 29 Apr 2002 15:53:16 -0000 &quot;mimi_rothschild&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mimi@...\">mimi@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Dear Fellow Homeschoolers,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My name is Mimi and I have been homeschooling  my 7 kids for the <br/>\n&gt; past 14 yearsway back when people did not even know what it was.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In 1997 every parents nightmare came true for my husband (of 23 <br/>\n&gt; years) and I lost our beloved Andrew to an unnecessary and <br/>\n&gt; preventable death. Rather than become debilitated by our devastating <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; loss, the Lord gave me the hope that He would use this tragedy for <br/>\n&gt; His glory. Immediately following Andrew&#39;s death, another son, Riley <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Josiah, became critically ill and required life support, 24 hour <br/>\n&gt; nursing, and 26 operations in 2.5 years. During this time of <br/>\n&gt; mourning our loss, caring for our sick child I was caring for a <br/>\n&gt; newborn and homeschooling 4 other kids. The Lord taught me two <br/>\n&gt; invaluable lessons - not all loving parents are able to homeschool <br/>\n&gt; by themselves and that there was an enormous need for a <br/>\n&gt; homeschooling help to come to parents when they cannot do it all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To fulfill this need and God&#39;s promise that our loss would be used <br/>\n&gt; for good, my husband and I founded The Grace Academy, an online <br/>\n&gt; school (pending licensing) that delivers world class curriculum to <br/>\n&gt; children throughout the world. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Many have called The Grace Academy the &quot;best of both world-<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling and Christian private school.&quot; Grace provides a <br/>\n&gt; comprehensive, world class Christian K-12 curriculum, daily Bible <br/>\n&gt; studies, devotions, and dedicated Christian teachers - all while <br/>\n&gt; your child(ren) learn in your safe and nurturing home..
