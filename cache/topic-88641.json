But there are so many things I CAN do that many, <br/>\nMANY average mom&#39;s were never taught (sewing, altering, knitting, spinning, <br/>\ncarding, (learning) weaving, gardening, butchering and skinning, building, masonry <br/>\nwork) that I just learned from living the way we do.  We are not <br/>\nsurvivalists, but if a great depression swept across the country I have no doubt my kids <br/>\nand their kids could easily survive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe house we live in was built entirely from the first boards nailed, by my <br/>\nson (10 yo when we started, 15 now) and my husband, with the girls and I doing <br/>\na good deal of work too.  I have no doubt my son could build his own house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of my kids are artistic, creative, and talented.  They all dance and fool <br/>\naround with musical instruments.  Other than dance lessons, we&#39;ve just given <br/>\nthem the TOOLS to be artistic, creative and talented with, and they&#39;ve done <br/>\nthe rest.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I seriously consider the kind of person they turn out to be the most <br/>\nimportant, high above academics.  They&#39;re all easy to get along with, kind to <br/>\nothers, crazy funny, independent, and strong in their convictions.  I want them to <br/>\nknow, above anything, that THEY can make their lives happy if they choose to <br/>\nbe happy in whatever they do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B. in WV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1658973,"authorName":"Barb Eaton","from":"Barb Eaton &lt;homemama@...&gt;","profile":"homesmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[UnschoolingDiscusion] Another question","postDate":"1073972333","msgId":88641,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJDMjhFRTlDLjFDQUFEJWhvbWVtYW1hQGluZmluZXQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":88665,"prevInTime":88640,"nextInTime":88642,"topicId":88641,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Wendy, I never went to college and have my own gifts .

I can&#39;t see anything better than that. Following his interests<br/>\nand talents. Celebrating who _he_ is now. The future is there for him to<br/>\ngrasp. How could that possibly limit him?<br/>\n<br/>\n   We all go through times of doubt. I&#39;ve been there but as they say &quot;this<br/>\nto shall pass&quot;. These women want you to be just like them. One upmanship and<br/>\nall that. A follower of the herd. Brake out from that corral and be that<br/>\nwild mare/stallion. Stand by your convictions and lead the way!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBarb E<br/>\n&quot;The function of the child is to live his own life - not the life that his<br/>\nanxious parents think he should live, nor the life according to the purpose<br/>\nof the educator who thinks he knows what is best. All of this interference<br/>\nand guidance on the part of adults only produces a generation of robots.&quot;<br/>\nA S Neill<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\none of them told me that only people with<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; higher education should unschool, and that you must be a very smart person<br/>\n&gt; to unschool. Do all of you have higher education and are you &quot;Gifted&quot;. One<br/>\n&gt; girl told me that I was limited and that I shouldnt homeschool/unschool<br/>\n&gt; cause Im holding my son back.<br/>\n&gt; Im so hurt by these women.
