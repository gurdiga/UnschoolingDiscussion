Don’t get me wrong, we love our teacher! However she wants to wait until she is 11. I feel like I would be disrespecting her judgement and experience if I were to go out and buy Grace some pointe shoes without involving her. It’s the potential injury risk too as you have said. We have only one dance school in our town so I don’t have the option to shop around. We are participating in one of the Australian Ballet school summer workshops in January though so maybe we can get more feedback there.&lt;&lt;</span></div><div><br> </div><div><font size=\"4\">I wouldn&#39;t ask the teacher anymore - demi or otherwise, she &#39;has&#39; to follow this guideline. You are right also about her seeing it as disrespect, and now that we have a clearer picture of just one dance school in town and one dance shop too - I can see that the buying of a first pair of pointe shoes for your daughter would be news and spread like wild fire..and of course keep her sweet she certainly sounds sweet, and I have heard worse ways of telling a desperate dancers mum that they are not ready! , she is not wrong and she is following dance teacher/school guidelines. I think it really is about helping her through this frustrating time as best you can and being a support and a good ear. She is certainly not alone there are lots of young girls dreaming and longing for those magical shoes!</font></div><div><font size=\"4\"><br></font></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 128, 128);font-family:Calibri;font-size:16pt;\">You mentioned the risk of twisting ankles. I have read online lots about risk of permanent injury. IS this an overstatement or actually something to be concerned about? </span></div><div><font size=\"4\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"4\">Dance is full of potential injuries and risks and  some are permanent and career ending - NONE of it is natural, and ALL professional dancers have wrecked bodies from about early to late thirties on… (dealing with a recurring and painful back injury as I write) with pointe work there are risky areas like knees and  ankles mainly, EVEN if the child is 11 and strong, and of course lots of scare mongering too as with everything. But most of those injuries would only happen if a young child went up on pointe and immediately danced around doing lots of steps, but thats not going to happen and but the reality is way different….It hurts! and its a shock how much it hurts, and it&#39;s really disappointing too…. I cried and exclaimed loudly that this isn&#39;t fair why does it hurt so much! So the reality is she will not get much further for a long while than just going up and down. So it will be a slow but sure process and easy to assess where any weakness&#39;s are, and which areas need to be strengthened and the teacher will be on the ball for that, and as Joyce pointed out she may be held back by the others, or be the bench mark.</font></div><div><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-size:15px;line-height:21px;\"><br><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> </span></blockquote></span></div><div><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-size:15px;line-height:21px;\">&gt;&gt;My take on it -- just from a learning standpoint since I don&#39;t have much knowledge of dance -- is that if your daughter were to do pointe at home, she&#39;d learn her limits.

Be understanding that it&#39;s frustrating when bodies grow at their own speed and not at the speed we want them to.

id=\"ygrps-yiv-1205595552\"><div dir=\"ltr\">I pretty much never post on this group because others are much more intuned with (and articulate about) unschooling than I am, and I find that I do better if I just absorb and live. But something struck me in this, maybe because I do have an idea for you: empathy. As in, empathize, but don&#39;t try to fix it. She&#39;s hitting a wall based on the reality of her current place in life, and that&#39;s so, so frustrating. But you can&#39;t fix it, and really, neither can she. It&#39;s a question of time and growth, right? <div>\n<br></div><div>I remember once someone giving me the following story to help me with this concept. Imagine that you&#39;re working an office job. Another employee sabotages you, and you are fired, unceremoniously, and on-the-spot. No opportunity to defend yourself, just an unjust ruling and you&#39;re out of a job. You&#39;re scared for the future, you&#39;re angry about what happened, and you feel betrayed. You go home to your partner, and you vent about what happened. Do you want your partner to: 1) tell you it&#39;s not that bad, you can get another job, just relax and calm down (dismissing all of your emotions about the situation); 2) get really angry on your behalf and try to call your boss to fix the situation (escalating the situation and stealing any power you might still have); or 3) give you a big hug and say &quot;Wow, that sucks. I&#39;m so, so sorry. I&#39;m here for you.&quot; (empathizing with you and giving you the support to make your own decisions and heal in your own way)</div>\n<div><br></div><div>Offer your child what you would want offered to you if the worst thing happened. Know that your child&#39;s frustrations and pains are as scary and demoralizing and huge as your own are, even if they don&#39;t seem that way &quot;in the big picture.&quot; Growing up is so hard (and takes forever! as my kids like to tell me....). Let her know that you know it sucks that she can&#39;t do pointe right now, and you love her, and if there&#39;s anything that you can do, you&#39;re there to do it. Then just stop talking and acting and having any opinions, and follow her lead. Listen to her. Be present and calm and empathetic, but don&#39;t fix it (because the reality is, you can&#39;t, right?!). If she wants a solution from you, then you can honestly say that you don&#39;t have one, except to work hard and build the muscles and let time do its thing. And you recognize that&#39;s not the answer she wants and it&#39;s frustrating. </div>\n<div><br></div><div>Obviously, if you get some good concrete suggestions for ways to help her sooner, that&#39;s great, but I personally don&#39;t have any, so I&#39;d go the route of knowing my limitations and trying to empathize with how frustrating the world can be sometimes. And know that sometimes even good concrete solutions won&#39;t be what she&#39;s looking for, sometimes she just needs someone to confirm that whatever she&#39;s going through sucks. (with an underlying message that you have confidence in her resilience and her ability to get through this.)</div>\n<div><br></div><div>I hope that helps. </div><div><br></div><div>Best,</div><div>Kimberley <br clear=\"all\"><div><br></div>-- <br><div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;border-collapse:collapse;line-height:15px;\">“It is paradoxical that many educators and parents still differentiate<br>\nbetween a time for learning and a time for play without seeing the<br>vital connection between them.”<br>-- Leo F.

Don&#39;t say &quot;Yes, I understand, but ...&quot; She&#39;s going to be frustrated and irritated even if she understands. Find fun things to distract her so she doesn&#39;t wallow.

Don’t get me wrong, we love our teacher! However she wants to wait\nuntil she is 11. I feel like I would be disrespecting her judgement and\nexperience if I were to go out and buy Grace some pointe shoes without involving\nher. It’s the potential injury risk too as you have said. We have only one dance\nschool in our town so I don’t have the option to shop around. We are\nparticipating in one of the Australian Ballet school summer workshops in January\nthough so maybe we can get more feedback there.</font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">She gets onto youtube and checks out all the videos of\nyoungsters on pointe and she gets very upset. I suggest she doesn’t watch them\nas it just makes her feel worse.</font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">I agree, I love barefoot dancing too! There’s something very\nmagical about those pointe shoes though.</font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">That’s why I was looking into demi pointes. Anyway, I think\nour teacher would be none too pleased if I went off and did our own thing with\nthis. You mentioned the risk of twisting ankles. I have read online lots about\nrisk of permanent injury.
