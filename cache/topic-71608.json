We&#39;ve only had one <br/>\nportfolio review so far, but it was with an unschooling friendly person.  The <br/>\nportfolio was just a box full of miscellaneous from the year: literature from any <br/>\nprograms we attended, art work, stories she wrote, a book my daughter had just <br/>\nfinished reading.  This year the progress is obvious to me. My daughter went <br/>\nfrom a tentative reader to a &quot;just about can read anything&quot; reader. So I&#39;ll <br/>\nmention that to the reviewer, but I won&#39;t prepare anything to quantify it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegina<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Date: Fri, 30 May 2003 23:57:29 EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HMSL2@...\">HMSL2@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSubject: How to show progress<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions on showing progress for a review?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I mean is I have a Portfolio review and I have to &quot;show&quot; progress over <br/>\n<br/>\nthe year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had planned on saying/writing down what he has done over the year.
