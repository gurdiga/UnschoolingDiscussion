I have not begun homeschooling yet but <br/>\nyesterday I was able to attend a hs meeting closeby for the first <br/>\ntime. I found out a lot of information and realize that this is what <br/>\nI really want to do. My 2 dd&#39;s will surely enjoy this as well (ages 6 <br/>\n& 3). I know that I will get a lot of support from this group (and I <br/>\nwill need it). My goal will be to start hs part time for the summer <br/>\nas my oldest dd really wants to finish kindergarten with her friends <br/>\n(and there is only 5 including her in her class) and continue thru <br/>\nthe summer with this same group for day camp. Since I really want to <br/>\nknock out as much debt as possible before quitting my current job, <br/>\nthis will work to my advantage, as long as she remains happy. And <br/>\nbefore any of you ask, no I cannot continue this current job part <br/>\ntime or on any other hours than 8:30-5 mon-fri, nor can I work from <br/>\nhome with this company. I would still like to hear from the rest of <br/>\nyou as to any part-time (preferrably from home) jobs everyone has <br/>\nthat has found to be helpful. I&#39;m in Illinois (homeschoolers <br/>\nparadise, from what I&#39;ve been told). Thanks for everything! <br/>\nEveryone&#39;s advise has been very helpful.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20782,"nextTopicId":20047}}
