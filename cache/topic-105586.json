It&#39;s the <br/>\ndifference between anger, regret, resentment and happiness, comfort <br/>\nand joy in life.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 4 years ago, we lived with my husbands grandma to care for her <br/>\nafter grandpa died and she couldn&#39;t live alone any longer.  To try to <br/>\nmake a long story short, she fell, broke both arms, it was cheaper <br/>\nfor me to quit my job and take care of her than going into a nursing <br/>\nhome/rehab center so yes, I chose to care for her.  I should have <br/>\nknown better - for as long as we knew her, she was known to say mean, <br/>\nspitefull things, talk behind your back, be very demanding <br/>\netc....Well, I took care of her for about 18 months full time - alone <br/>\nbecause no one else in the family could stand to be around her.  I <br/>\nalmost fell apart - I think I must have had a nervous breakdown - I <br/>\nmade some really bad choices because I was so miserable - I turned <br/>\ninto her - I was just awful to be around but didn&#39;t feel like I had <br/>\nany choices.  Even though she was so awful to me, I couldn&#39;t stand <br/>\nthe thought of putting her in a nursing home, I was afraid that she <br/>\nwould feel so alone and out of place so I wouldn&#39;t consider it.  My <br/>\nfamily & marriage suffered terribly until she passed away.  After she <br/>\nwas gone I told myself &quot;never again&quot;.  But as I see our parents <br/>\naging, I&#39;m already telling myself I couldn&#39;t put them in a nursing <br/>\nhome - yes that&#39;s my choice I guess but it&#39;s also my responsibility?  <br/>\nor my guilt?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m kind of in the same boat now - I&#39;m not very happy with my life <br/>\nbut I feel I have no choice and it&#39;s due to guilt.  I work for my <br/>\ndad&#39;s small business, it&#39;s going under, they just filed bankruptcy <br/>\nbut if we can someone just make it work until dad&#39;s full retirement <br/>\nkicks in in about a year, I&#39;m barely getting paid anymore, we are <br/>\nfalling behind on our bills, but if I quit (which I really would have <br/>\nliked to do years ago) then my mom would have to do my job and the <br/>\nlast time they tried working together they almost got a divorce and <br/>\nstill have marriage problems.  So I stay, also I tell myself it&#39;s a <br/>\ngood flexible situation with my daughter being homeschooled and them <br/>\nbeing her grandparents!  Then throw my 28 year old brother into the <br/>\npicture, he&#39;s back home with my mom & dad, trying to recover from <br/>\nprescription drug abuse.  He&#39;s been home 3 years and driving us all <br/>\ncrazy - we think he&#39;s bipolar, there&#39;s no money for counseling etc.. <br/>\nhis pride prevents him from going to the county for help unless one <br/>\nof us take him by the hand etc.... I learned my lesson from taking <br/>\ncare of grandma - I don&#39;t want to be around a situation like that <br/>\nagain but I kind of am now.  BUT my guilt makes me stay or my feeling <br/>\nof responsibility.  I&#39;d love to say that I quit because I need a <br/>\npaycheck, and not worry about what that will do to mom and I love to <br/>\nwork somewhere else where I&#39;m not around my brother all day BUT <br/>\nagain, I stay..........Is that my choice?  or my guilt?  or my <br/>\nresponsibility?<br/>\n<br/>\nTracie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105283,"nextTopicId":105601}}
