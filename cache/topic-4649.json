Ideally, I take everything<br/>\noff the table, and cover it with newspaper (taped on underneath so it<br/>\nstays).  If I don&#39;t have time to do that (often I don&#39;t), we either use<br/>\npaper on one section, or do without and wash up soon after.  But I don&#39;t<br/>\nparticularly care about stains on the table, so that&#39;s an option for us<br/>\nthat might not be an option for others.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than paint:  we use markers, rubber stamps (lots!), different kinds<br/>\nof crayons, colored pencils, other pens and pencils, ink pads and<br/>\nfingerprints (get the washable kind!).<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of these aren&#39;t particularly messy.  We also use a variety of sizes of<br/>\nthings to paint on- postcards, small circles (to be made into ornaments).<br/>\nKeeping things small reduces mess and clutter some.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also do stuff with paper and scissors (that&#39;s messier than paint, I<br/>\nthink), hole punches in various shapes, folding paper (origami and other<br/>\nstuff), fimo clay, stuff from nature (pine cones, twigs, dried flowers,<br/>\nwhatever is around).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my three is very much into art.  We bought her a large portfolio to<br/>\nkeep her work in after it dries, and a small rack thing to dry paintings in<br/>\n(it is really a thing designed to organize paperwork- several page sized<br/>\nshelves in a wooden thing like a cube, found it at a yard sale)  She<br/>\ndecides what to keep.  She also has several cheap frames, and she puts some<br/>\nwork in the frames and changes that from time to time.  I also have a<br/>\nlaminator, and occasionally, will laminate a very special piece.  We have<br/>\nalso made color copies of special pieces, and laminated those to send to<br/>\nrelatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nLinda Wyatt<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hilinda@...\">hilinda@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lightlink.com/hilinda\">http://www.lightlink.com/hilinda</a><br/>\nLearning everywhere, all the time.<br/>\nAlgebra before breakfast<br/>\n&quot;A lie, you see, no matter how often or how vociferously repeated, may be<br/>\nmistaken for the truth, but it does not become the truth.&quot; - Adam Crown</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"megates@xxxx.xxx","from":"megates@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"NaKP9zApZWL2KR181V3MLtNwyJl0CaIc-SQvIABk4FAI64VKUs7d2yslUvGaYZPIIalsR89exQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"ART","postDate":"943035864","msgId":4649,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zMDQuNDY0OS45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4650,"prevInTime":4648,"nextInTime":4650,"topicId":4649,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m on the fence with the math drills, but here is my concern: Paint, messy paint, -takes longer to set up and clean up than for them to paint- Paint!
