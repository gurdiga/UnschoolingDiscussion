There&#39;s a ton of stuff written about and <br/>\nby him, but here&#39;s something easy with a timeline:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://oaks.nvg.org/wm6ra6.html\">http://oaks.nvg.org/wm6ra6.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nA quote:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- In Rudolf Steiner spiritual wisdom assumed a new shape. He began to <br/>\noperate from pure thought, and detected living thoughts filling the Universe. As a <br/>\nresult of his discoveries, Steiner was bent on putting force and life into <br/>\nthinking, through thinking, within thinking. His basic philosophic works, <br/>\nespecially the Philosophy of Spiritual Activity, and many exercises he devised, are <br/>\ndirected to this end, to strengthen the thinking faculties in man till thinking <br/>\nworks itself on and up and gets free from the brain system.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s some more, and at the risk of irritating his fans, I think it can be <br/>\nsummarized as &quot;he pulled this stuff out of his ass,&quot; or &quot;out of the air.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- After reaching this stage of &quot;independent thinking&quot;, Steiner discovered <br/>\nthat this &quot;living thinking&quot; could awaken parts of him from &quot;above&quot;. Thought <br/>\nthat had risen into subtility, could even impart life to a dormant spiritual <br/>\nperception in Steiner. From about 1900 Steiner began to pursue this path with <br/>\ndetermination, and gradually came to discern three forms of higher knowledge:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Imagination: a higher seeing of the spiritual world in revealing images; <br/>\n2.  Inspiration: a higher hearing of the spiritual world, through which it <br/>\nreveals its creative forces and its creative order; <br/>\n3.  Intuition: the stage at which an intuitive penetration into the sphere of <br/>\nSpiritual Beings becomes possible.<br/>\nEquipped with his few-found imagination, inspiration, and intuition, Steiner <br/>\ndeveloped a substantial body of spiritual and practical knowledge up to his <br/>\ndeath in 1925. He gave it the name &quot;Anthroposophy&quot;-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother (scarier) bio is here:  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kheper.net/topics/Anthroposophy/Steiner.htm\">http://www.kheper.net/topics/Anthroposophy/Steiner.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97523,"nextTopicId":97536}}
