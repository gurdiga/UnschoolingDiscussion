It&#39;s a really peaceful religion.  <br/>\nThere aren&#39;t many of those in the world.  And it didn&#39;t save India from <br/>\nEngland or from the religious wars there which spawned Pakistan (East and <br/>\nWest) and then Bangladesh.  Their beliefs about their soul&#39;s immediate future <br/>\nare much different from the beliefs of their own Moslem neighbors, and from <br/>\nmost Americans.<br/>\n<br/>\nLess than two weeks before the attacks here, Keith and I had told our kids <br/>\nabout Japanese kamikaze fighters in WWII, and how their religious and <br/>\ncultural beliefs allowed for suicide which our own culture declares sinful <br/>\nand illegal, and soul-damning.  Now we&#39;re up against another religion and <br/>\nculture which also allows and sometimes glorifies self-immolation.  We can&#39;t <br/>\nchange their history or their culture or what their religious leaders say.  <br/>\nWe can&#39;t change what the Koran says.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could lie down and be peaceful until we&#39;re all dead.  We could die <br/>\nwishfully hoping that our wishful hoping could avert millions of believers in <br/>\nother religions.  That&#39;s a lot of what religion is anyway---what were you <br/>\nbelieving at the moment of your death?
