Anna has always been &quot;backwards&quot; with her words.. Its been a constant <br/>\n( good natured) joke around here .. Hmm. let me see if I can think of some <br/>\nothers.  She told me her preschool teacher&#39;s name was money.. it took me a <br/>\nwhile to remember her name was Penny.. lol.. She used to say her pants were <br/>\n&quot;driving&quot; up her butt, inside of &quot;riding&quot; up her butt..She used to recite a <br/>\nblessing before dinner. &quot;Come Lord Jesus, be our guest, put our service to <br/>\nthe test&quot;  ( that last line mixed up from Beauty and the Beast.. it should <br/>\nhave been , let this food to us be blessed) Then as she got older, her flubs <br/>\nwere even more funny.. A couple of years ago, she took me aside and told me <br/>\nin all seriousness that uncle Kyle&#39;s pants made him look like he had an <br/>\nerosion.  LMAO!!.. I about DIED.. OH GOD, it was so freaking funny.. because <br/>\nhe DID look kind of like an idiot in these spandex/lycra bike shorts that had <br/>\na padded crotch.. AND because Anna had obviously made a connection from our <br/>\nrecent discussions of boys getting erections and Kyles &quot;erosion&quot;  Whew wee.. <br/>\nThen, one night we talked about renting Children of the Corn, it was one of <br/>\nthe first horror movies that dh and I saw together.. The rental store didnt <br/>\nhave the first one.. but we got some of the sequels.. Anna asked later.. &#39;are <br/>\nwe going to watch that Corn Kids movie&quot;    She does this kind of thing all of <br/>\nthe time.. its really endearing. She is such a sweet, smart girl.. its funny <br/>\nto hear her get her words mixed up.
