(choose your<br/>\nword)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had been gone all evening and we were hungry.  We live in the country and<br/>\nMcDonald&#39;s in a ten or 15 minute drive from our house but near my mother&#39;s<br/>\nhouse.  We go to McDonald&#39;s maybe half a dozen times a year, at most.  But I<br/>\nwanted something hot and fast and cheap and I like McDonald&#39;s food, even<br/>\nthough I know it isn&#39;t the most nutritional food on the planet.  I thought<br/>\nabout ordering a salad or some other healthy thing but then I thought.  I go<br/>\nto McDonald&#39;s so infrequently, a Big Mac and fries isn&#39;t going to kill me.<br/>\nSo, we went and got some MD food and decided to go to my mom&#39;s and visit her<br/>\nwhile we ate dinner.  I can&#39;t even remember what she said but she commented<br/>\non the fact that we were eating such unhealthy food.  I knew she would<br/>\nbefore I went there.  In the past I wouldn&#39;t have brought McDonald&#39;s food to<br/>\nher house to eat just because of that.  I didn&#39;t want a dose of guilt with<br/>\nmy fries, thanks.  I knew they weren&#39;t healthy and I chose to eat them<br/>\nanyway.  This time decided that it was worth the visit (we hadn&#39;t visited<br/>\nfor a few weeks) and that I would disregard her comments.  When she asked<br/>\nwhy we got that *crap*, I responded that I wanted something cheap and hot.<br/>\nShe said she&#39;d have made us something.  I responded that I wanted something<br/>\ncheap, hot, greasy and good and that McD fit the bill.  I told her that I<br/>\nthought of getting something healthy but decided that I eat there so<br/>\ninfrequently that it wouldn&#39;t kill me.  And it tastes good to me. My kids<br/>\nwould prefer Subway but both thought the idea of something hot was a good<br/>\none this time.  We had been out in the cold drizzle for 3 hours watching<br/>\nhorses and riders.   Both ate their fries and drank their drinks.  I threw<br/>\nout a whole wrapped hamburger and one that had a couple bites taken out of<br/>\nit.  It wasn&#39;t *because* it was junk or that my mother commented on it.  It<br/>\nwas because they just don&#39;t like it all that much and they ate just what<br/>\nthey wanted from the meal and no more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try really hard NOT to give my kids a dose of guilt with their food, and<br/>\nalthough I know I am successful most of the time, I know I fail sometimes at<br/>\nit.  I shall try harder not to do that to my kids because one day instead of<br/>\nbringing their dinner to my house to eat while they visit, they may eat in<br/>\ntheir car instead of having a dose of guilt with their food.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; That&#39;s not a good way for natural learning to unfold peacefully.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not a way for family life to become more harmonious. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] the problem with dichotomies and definitions","postDate":"1119063845","msgId":106707,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyQjM4RjI1LjUwODA1MDZAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQyQjM4NjVDLjIwNTA4MDdAc2lvLm1pZGNvLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDE0NS40Nzc3NGRjZi4yZmU0ODY0ZUBhb2wuY29tPiA8NDJCMzg2NUMuMjA1MDgwN0BzaW8ubWlkY28ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":106703,"nextInTopic":106753,"prevInTime":106706,"nextInTime":106708,"topicId":106696,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** MY fear in this situation is the child will eat the *crap* and think, Something this good just *can t* be crap, mom must be a liar.
