The issue is whether they can use public accommodations in doing so --<br/>\npublic schools, public parks, etc. -- which are paid for with funds collected<br/>\nfrom the entire community, including people who happen to be gay.  I am not<br/>\npermitted to not pay my taxes to support the use of these public accommodations<br/>\nby groups which practice exclusion.  So the only fair solution is deny access to<br/>\nthose who practice exclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, I work for a public agency.  Gay-only bars and clubs cannot solicit<br/>\nfor funds through the United Way in my agency because they practice exclusion.<br/>\nSo it would be a double standard to allow the Boy Scouts to do so.

Every leader is subject to back <br/>\nground checks and is required to sign statements that they understand and <br/>\nagree to uphold the BSA standards.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery boy is required to review a pamphlet directly addressing abuse, <br/>\nincluding sexual abuse.

There is no way to miss it.<br/>\n<br/>\nScout leaders have ongoing training directed at avoiding problems with abuse <br/>\nof any sort.  Leaders are required to NEVER be alone with a boy.  All scout <br/>\nactivities are to include at least 2 adults.  Boys are to work in teams to <br/>\naccomplish their rank advancement and merit badge activities.  This is for <br/>\nthe safety of the leader, the boy and BSA&#39;s liability.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone that has been actively involved in Boy Scouts or has spent any time <br/>\nchecking out the organization or the requirements for Scouting would know <br/>\nthese steps are taken.  This is not a new thing.  The above requirements have <br/>\nbeen in place for at least 20 years.

I think people have a right to associate<br/>\nwith whomever they choose when it is not funded by taxpayers dollars.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the scouts don&#39;t want &quot;x&quot; folks in their &quot;club,&quot; then &quot;x&quot; folks should<br/>\njust go and start their own group.  And, it isn&#39;t just about the<br/>\norientation thing either.  I think it was absolutely ridiculous for the<br/>\nparents of that girl to sue because she wanted to be a BOY scout.  I think<br/>\nit is absolutely ridiculous for women to want to join men&#39;s clubs and I<br/>\nthink the reverse is true also.  This sue, sue, sue garbage is out of<br/>\ncontrol.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, there are times when &quot;civil rights&quot; issues should be addressed and<br/>\nthere should be some equal access issues addressed but I really think there<br/>\nare more important things in life that needed to be addressed than who gets<br/>\nto join private clubs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, what&#39;s next, is someone going to sue an individual family because<br/>\nthe one family won&#39;t let their kids play with the other family&#39;s kids?   I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think this is any different than those nutcake newagers who say they<br/>\nhave a right to our ndn religions and traditions!  They aren&#39;t wanted and<br/>\nif they choose to sue, then we will fold up shop and go underground!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the private vs. public in the solicitation of funding, why not?  No<br/>\none is forced to donate, that is a personal choice.  As to the use of<br/>\n&quot;public&quot; buildings, well if the KKK can use them and have then the same<br/>\nprinciple that their use was based on would apply to the scouts, they pay<br/>\ntaxes, they have a right to use what their tax dollars have paid for.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda, who will quit rambling now as I am sure that this was all clear as<br/>\nmud &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Nanci and Thomas Kuykendall &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tn-k4of5@...\">tn-k4of5@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Save Our Scouts website<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thursday, September 28, 2000 8:33 AM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Not sure if any of you are interested in the  Boy Scouts current<br/>\n </span></blockquote>problems.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nope.
