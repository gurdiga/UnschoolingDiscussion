One day for no<br/>\nparticular reason I was late and during that time a girl stopped by because<br/>\nshe needed a new room and my name was on a list of people without roommates.<br/>\n(Mine had moved to a sorority.) I said sure and she moved in and we became<br/>\ngood friends. She introduced me to the frat she hung out at where her<br/>\nboyfriend was. We hung out there regularly and a couple years later I met my<br/>\nfuture husband at that frat.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas my being late for dinner that day driven by cosmic powers so my husband<br/>\nand I could meet a few years later?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, why wouldn&#39;t the cosmic powers have just brought my roommate to my<br/>\ndoor earlier so they didn&#39;t have to delay me to dinner?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if we&#39;d missed each other and The Cosmic Powers wanted me to get<br/>\ninvolved with the frat, wouldn&#39;t they send other event my way?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly I think the foundations of cosmic forces crumble once you start<br/>\nthinking them through.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were choices and circumstances that brought us together at the right<br/>\ntime and future events happened because of it, but I think the conjunction<br/>\nwas all just chance. It&#39;s spooky that I was late to dinner the one day my<br/>\nroommate and I could have hooked up. But, nonetheless, I don&#39;t believe there<br/>\nwere any cosmic powers directing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And <br/>\n&gt; whether it is or isn&#39;t, is there a purpose for being here, that you see?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No predetermined purpose.

And everyone will pay attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think people have been conning others since the beginning of language.<br/>\n<br/>\nI heard about this scam in college. A guy would write to a 1000 people and<br/>\ntell half he predicted a certain stock would rise and tell the other half it<br/>\nwould fall. Of those half he sent the &quot;right&quot; prediction to, he split those<br/>\nin half and sent half rise and half fall predictions on a different stock.<br/>\nAfter 5 predictions he&#39;s got about 30 people convinced he can predict<br/>\nstocks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you <br/>\n&gt; automatically discount them and what they seem to believe they know if they<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t explain how or where it comes from?<br/>\n&gt; What benefits would a child get<br/>\n&gt; from <br/>\n&gt; an adult who doesn&#39;t believe them, from your POV?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter is sometimes convinced that she&#39;s right on something she<br/>\nremembers when I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s wrong.

Psychic phenomena<br/>\nis low on my believability scale so from my point of view the explanations<br/>\nof someone telling a &quot;psychic&quot; tale would be that they were confused or<br/>\nlying or teasing me.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Learning Lessons from life (was some digest xtyx2...","postDate":"1064365549","msgId":81358,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDOEQ3Mzk0LUVFMkItMTFENy1BRTQ0LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJrcW5vZStjcm44QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":81350,"nextInTopic":81360,"prevInTime":81357,"nextInTime":81359,"topicId":81336,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
