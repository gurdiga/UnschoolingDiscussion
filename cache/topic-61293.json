Entitled &quot;The O&#39;Keefes,&quot; and starring Judge Reinhold and <br/>\nKirsten Nelson as loving but (stereo-typically) eccentric parents of <br/>\nthree (stereo-typically) brilliant children, the show apparently <br/>\ncasts the parents as the (stereo-typically) over-protective type of <br/>\nhomeschooling parents. When the teenagers (stereo-typically) grow <br/>\ncurious about the outside world and attend public school, they are <br/>\n(stereo-typically) unable to converse with kids their own age.<br/>\n<br/>\nA show of hands, please  - who is surprised to find homeschoolers <br/>\nstereotyped this way? More about that in a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn February 23, 2003, homeschooling author (The Homeschool <br/>\nRevolution) Isabel Lyman took umbrage with the TV show&#39;s promotional <br/>\nmaterial in her sharply worded article, &quot;The Why of Homeschool,&quot;and <br/>\nlambasts the stereotypes. Read her article at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mises.org/fullstory.asp?control=1167\">http://www.mises.org/fullstory.asp?control=1167</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn response to Lyman&#39;s article, Cathy D. Henderson writes &quot;How do I <br/>\nStereotype? Let Me Count the Ways,&quot; claiming that Lyman&#39;s article <br/>\noffers its own batch of stereotypes at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.educationalfreedom.com/pages/editorial.html\">http://www.educationalfreedom.com/pages/editorial.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNow, back to those stereotypes.  The stereotypes in this proposed <br/>\nshow seem to me to derive either directly or indirectly from the very <br/>\nreasons we love to cite when we promote homeschooling. Doesn&#39;t our <br/>\nsuccess practically guarantee that sometime, somewhere, somebody is <br/>\ngoing to try to lampoon homeschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure that we win, no matter what happens.  If the show turns out <br/>\nto be actually funny, we as homeschoolers can show that we have the <br/>\nmaturity to laugh at ourselves, all the while using the show as a <br/>\nspringboard to redirect the public eye to a more truthful view of <br/>\nhomeschooling. If the show is a dud, we&#39;ll only have to endure it for <br/>\na few weeks, all the while using the show as a springboard to <br/>\nredirect the public eye to a more truthful view of homeschooling. And <br/>\nperhaps the show won&#39;t air at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecretly, I hope the show turns out to be a hilarious send-up of <br/>\npublic school stereotypes through the eyes of three stereotyped <br/>\nhomeschooled kids - now THAT would be funny.

March 8, 2003<br/>\n From the article:<br/>\n&quot;That&#39;s &#39;crunchy,&#39; as in crunchy granola. There&#39;s a whiff of the New <br/>\nAge movement about them. They eat organic food and oppose suburban <br/>\nsprawl. They rarely watch TV and question consumerism, value the arts <br/>\nand read authors like J.R.R. Tolkien, media critics like Neil Postman <br/>\nand eco-urban planners like James Howard Kunstler. But they&#39;re also <br/>\n&#39;cons,&#39; as in conservative. They&#39;re religious, in an orthodox way, <br/>\nand oppose abortion, euthanasia and same-sex blessings. They&#39;re <br/>\nsuspicious of big government. They value family and have big ones. To <br/>\nprotect their kids from salacious mass culture, they tend to <br/>\nhome-school.&quot; (Near as I can tell, the term was first coined last <br/>\nfall in The National Review.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs if we needed another label.<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\nThe &#39;Why We Homeschool&#39; Department<br/>\n<br/>\nSt. Petersburg Times, St. Petersburg, FL   March 16, 2003<br/>\nHeadline:  Homework crunch: Is there time to just be a kid?<br/>\n&quot;First-graders spend minutes on it. Seniors can take hours. Some <br/>\nparents say free time is disappearing.&quot;<br/>\nThe article suggests that too much [home]work makes Jack and Jill <br/>\ndull, dull, dull. I couldn&#39;t agree more.  There is more to life than <br/>\nhomework.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally...<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease let me know what is happening in YOUR part of the homeschool <br/>\nworld. Are there homeschooled kids and families in the news?  Do you <br/>\nhave legal/legislative challenges or successes?
