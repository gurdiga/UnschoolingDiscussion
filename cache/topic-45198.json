It drives some people batty.<br/>\nBut she is slowly getting more open and talkative. Even ordered her own food <br/>\nat the restaurant last week, a first! Usually the waiters get ignored.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s the name. &lt;BG&gt; My Sierra will talk in the kind of ways you are <br/>\nmentioning. What I have a problem with is her talking to me when something <br/>\nhappens between her and her brother or sister. She generally just starts <br/>\ncrying and I can&#39;t get anything out of her. If I try later when she&#39;s calmed <br/>\ndown, she may just start crying all over again, or get real teary eyed and <br/>\nnot say anything but &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; It&#39;s real hard for me to get a <br/>\ndiscussion going with her about &#39;what happened&#39; and what we can do to fix <br/>\nit. There are times when she just sits there without saying anything at all <br/>\nwhile I&#39;m just asking her a question. It&#39;s very frustrating to me and my <br/>\nhusband when we are trying to help. And this only happens with her when <br/>\nthere is some kind of confrontation, either because of her or in spite of <br/>\nher.<br/>\nAny ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45033,"nextTopicId":45107}}
