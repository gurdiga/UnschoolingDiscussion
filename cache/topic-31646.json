For example what happens is your kids say &quot;We&#39;ll forgo the<br/>\nextra money this week - how much time can we buy with those dollars on the<br/>\ncomputer?&quot;  Do you then change the rules by refusing to allow them to do<br/>\nthat?<br/>\n<br/>\nWith system 1, you are training your children to live the way so many adults<br/>\nhave to live - work is &quot;negative&quot; boring, hard, tedious, to be escaped from<br/>\nasap; play is &quot;positive&quot; fun, enjoyable, real challenges - separate and<br/>\ndefinitely not equal. The good stuff is all in the future sometime. People<br/>\nwho have embraced unschooling are helping their children find their<br/>\npassions, enjoy them today, and relish challenges as part of a full life.<br/>\nThere are so many lengthy threads about the value of &quot;de-limiting&quot; computer<br/>\nand video game time that you could spend many hours reading and learning -<br/>\nas long as someone doesn&#39;t come along and tell you that it is time you did<br/>\nsome work first! Most of us do not entertain the idea that these things are<br/>\na privilege, any more than warm clothes, a place to sleep, and enough food<br/>\nare privileges.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWith system 2 - well the issue is still coercion. If you have some tasks<br/>\nthat you are responsible for, but really don&#39;t like, why not offer the kids<br/>\nthe opportunity to earn extra money by doing them? You could just as well be<br/>\noffering the job to a neighbor&#39;s teen, or it would be as if your kids were<br/>\noffered a job by someone outside of the immediate family. The key here is<br/>\nthe right of refusal. I would never tie refusing these job opportunities to<br/>\nany kind of punishment - including wandering around with a resentment in<br/>\nyour heart and on your face.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; We do this not only to &quot;coerce&quot; them into working but to show them that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; there is a relationship between doing work and enjoying the benefits of<br/>\n&gt; having worked.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why use quotation marks? This is not euphemistically coercion, this is the<br/>\nreal thing. Unschooling does not set up artificial situations with arbitrary<br/>\nlimitations, in order to demonstrate some principle or other. Unschooling<br/>\nallows people to discover their best selves - and lets life take care of the<br/>\nlife-lessons. The first time your toddler struggled to complete a block<br/>\ntower that stayed up, he learned about the joy of doing work.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523757,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"&quot;Pam Hartley&quot; &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","profile":"pdhartley2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Rewards","postDate":"1068422212","msgId":84286,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMxMTA5MjM1Ni5oQTlOdU9WczAxNTA4NUBtdGF3Ni5wcm9kaWd5Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":31680,"nextInTopic":84293,"prevInTime":84285,"nextInTime":84287,"topicId":31646,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That is much better&quot; kind of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, I expected kids to perhaps lose interest in a few months and<br/>\nclass to fold.  It has now been 7 months, most everyone is here for all of<br/>\ntheir classes.  All 8 of my students travel the 3 hours to Houston to test<br/>\nfor each belt level and so far no one has missed at all.  I told them that<br/>\non the 3 nights a week we don&#39;t have class, I was going to be working out<br/>\nanyway and they were welcome to come if they chose.  They chose.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my experience with &quot;no rewards&quot;.  I didn&#39;t want to spend my time<br/>\nbaby-sitting people.  I wanted to do karate.  I believe that if people want<br/>\nto do something, learn something, they will.  With my class and with my<br/>\nkids, I provide the opportunities and help when asked, other than that I<br/>\nstay out of the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84307,"nextTopicId":83965}}
