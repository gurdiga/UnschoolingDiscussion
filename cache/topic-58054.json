WORTH","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-657648917\">From another list;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have kept a journal for years. It&#39;s wonderful.<br/>\nMy son keeps a journal.<br/>\nBrianna keeps a journal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very thankful for my journal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWORTH REMEMBERING: &quot;People can keep a journal to record their life, their<br/>\nthoughts, their happiness, the events of their families, etc. They can also<br/>\nkeep a journal of creative observations, their hopes, their ideas and<br/>\ndreams, as Leonardo da Vinci did. He always had a notebook hanging from his<br/>\nbelt to record his observations. I have one constantly in my pocket and on<br/>\nmy night table. We must be the source of good ideas and dreams for a better<br/>\nworld. We are part of evolution.&quot; -- ROBERT MULLER<br/>\n<br/>\nCoyotes Corner<br/>\nVery Cool Stuff for the World<br/>\n&lt;www.coyotescorner.com&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57710,"nextTopicId":57954}}
