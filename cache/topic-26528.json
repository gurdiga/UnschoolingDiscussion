Hypocrisy: <br/>\n      {Ironically, in the Sept. 2000 edition of her Dr. Laura <br/>\nPerspective magazine, Laura endorses the same strategies GLAAD <br/>\nemployed. In the second part of her &quot;Kids & Sex&quot; article, Laura <br/>\nsays: &quot;Write to the source of any offensive content and tell them of <br/>\nyour concerns. Write that not only will you stop watching the program <br/>\nor reading the publication because of the stories or advertisements, <br/>\nbut you will also go out of your way not to purchase the sponsors&#39; <br/>\nproducts and will encourage others to avoid them as well&quot; [p. 7]. <br/>\nThis is exactly the kind of campaign GLAAD orchestrated.
