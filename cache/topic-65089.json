This discussion happened in the store while I was looking for hair color and I agreed to let her choose &quot;my color&quot;. Funny thing was when the tub filled with a deep hot pink color, (it was called cinnamon..) her response was &quot;&lt;g&gt;oohhh, never mind, I don&#39;t like it,  just keep rinsing till its gone.&quot;  People thought I was crazy for keeping it in, my mother for one and my boss another. (I was working fulltime) It was fun. It was then that I knew I was not the same as the &quot;other&quot; parents. I was told a child should never have that type of &quot;power&quot; over an adult. What power?!, I let them choose my hair color!?! We were just having fun! A couple of weeks later it washed out. And I was back to being...dare I say...normal?! &lt;g&gt;~We always have such a good laugh we look through the photo album. My fiance thinks we&#39;re a little crazy.  Once while still working I took a day off for a &quot;dress up&quot; day. (needless to say I had a very difficult time with the schools...they said I had to have permission to withdrawal my children in advance...silly people...lol...when will they learn...lol) We called David up at work and invited him to lunch. When he arrived he was greeted by 3 very lovely girls all dressed in my finest bridesmaids and prom dresses from years gone by. Complete with jewelry, gloves and heels. The table was set with candles and fine china. We presented him with a bow tie (from my waitress days) and seated him at the head of the table. The girls prepared the goumet meal...pb&amp;j&#39;s, I think that is the day we truely won his heart! He called in and spent the rest of day with us! We all look forward to spending the rest of our lives together.~Annie~~You may laugh at me because I am different.

Mine went through the pink, blue and purple hair. {even the then 2 year old} I liked the purple the best. It was semi-perm but because they had naturally blonde hair, and the two oldest&#39;s hair had a previous chemical {I&#39;m a cosmetologist and streaked their hair for them} it grabbed. They wore it for a while but got tired of it and I got it out for them. They may try it again later, if so it&#39;s cool with me. There are worst things they could do....Tracy---------------------------------Do you Yahoo!?The New Yahoo! Search - Faster. Easier.
