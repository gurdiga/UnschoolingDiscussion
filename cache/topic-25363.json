Eventually <br/>\nthings calmed down with him. We eliminated alot of the enriched flours from <br/>\nour diet, got rid of the Kraft maccaroni and cheese. Switched to Honey <br/>\ninstead of jellies. We had a decent diet, but I made some changes to things I <br/>\ndidnt know before. Like I didn&#39;t have any clue that white bread turns to <br/>\nsugar once in our system. I dusted off my bread maker and started making <br/>\nhomemade whole weat unriched bread. I started using honey and maple to flavor <br/>\nthings instead of sugars, etc. He calmed down a bit, but we still have <br/>\nsituations. Today for instance. He was out just plain picking fights. Nothign <br/>\nreally violent, but definately picking fights. He&#39;s been through so much, but <br/>\nI do hope that one day he can figure out how to heal enough that he&#39;s not so <br/>\nangry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25488,"nextTopicId":25490}}
