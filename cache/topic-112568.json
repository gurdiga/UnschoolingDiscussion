Even relying on  <br/>\nbooks too much or too early inhibits the ability of children to  <br/>\ndevelop direct relationships with the subjects they are studying-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nTell her you&#39;re not relying on books OR computers &quot;too much or too  <br/>\nearly,&quot; and that unschooling is all about direct learning by MANY means.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the article is titled &quot;Charlotte&#39;s Webpage: Why children shouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nhave the world at their fingertips.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re discussing classrooms, and book reports.    A quote about  <br/>\n&quot;the problem&quot;:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-The teacher explained that her students were so enthusiastic about  <br/>\nthe project that they chose to go to the computer lab rather than  <br/>\noutside for recess. While she seemed impressed by this dedication, it  <br/>\nunderscores the first troubling influence of computers. The medium is  <br/>\nso compelling that it lures children away from the kind of activities  <br/>\nthrough which they have always most effectively discovered themselves  <br/>\nand their place in the world.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I doubt that this author has been &quot;outside for recess&quot; in a  <br/>\npublic school lately.  That is NOT where people discover themselves  <br/>\nand their place in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is artsy and poetic, but it doesn&#39;t mean much:  &quot;If children do  <br/>\nnot dip their toes in the waters of unsupervised social activity,  <br/>\nthey likely will never be able to swim in the sea of civic  <br/>\nresponsibility.&quot;    For one thing, &quot;Myspace&quot; is quite an unsupervised  <br/>\nsocial activity. &lt;g&gt;  And to glorify school recess for being less  <br/>\nsupervised seems crazy to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-If they have no opportunities to dig in the soil, discover the  <br/>\nspiders, bugs, birds, and plants that populate even the smallest  <br/>\nunpaved playgrounds,-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nREALLY!?  We had a big playground, but there were no spiders, bugs,  <br/>\nbirds or plants.  There was sandy dirt, with some gravel and some  <br/>\nbroken glass.  One year there were three piles of dry cowdung,  <br/>\nbecause they had planned to plant something.  They never did.  We  <br/>\nplayed king of the mountain on piles of poo until it was evenly  <br/>\nscattered over the two acres of unpaved playground we had.  We did  <br/>\nhave six trees or so, honey locust or something with thorns and seed  <br/>\npods.  We weren&#39;t in danger of learning the fragility of flower  <br/>\npetals on that playground.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  thought it intriguing that the exerpts Sandra<br/>\n&gt;&gt; made highlighted the benefits of the Internet/computer use, whereas<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the education/computer &quot;expert&quot; in the Orion article bemoans the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; computer&#39;s tendency to separate kids from real life. (Didn&#39;t someone<br/>\n&gt;&gt; once say that about TV...?)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Guess it&#39;s a matter of user-failure -- or success!!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s a matter of the definition of success of the reporter.   <br/>\nOrion wants kids to be artists and poets in tune with the biological  <br/>\nworld.  Business Week wants to know how people are spending their  <br/>\nmoney, and whether those kids can get into Harvard.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the orion article:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Yet these projects�the steady diet of virtual trips to the  <br/>\nAntarctic, virtual climbs to the summit of Mount Everest, and trips  <br/>\ninto cyber-orbit that represent one technological high after another� <br/>\ngenerate only vicarious thrills. The student doesn&#39;t actually soar  <br/>\nabove the Earth, doesn&#39;t trek across icy terrain, doesn&#39;t climb a  <br/>\nmountain. Increasingly, she isn&#39;t even allowed to climb to the top of  <br/>\nthe jungle gym.<br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about books?  Same for books, only books don&#39;t have moving color  <br/>\nphotos taken yesterday (or a second before).  And kids can&#39;t ask a  <br/>\nquestion of a book.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-For children, belonging is the most important function a community  <br/>\nserves. Indeed, that is the message that lies at the heart of  <br/>\nCharlotte&#39;s Web. None of us�whether of barnyard or human society� <br/>\nthrives without a sense of belonging. In my case, belonging hinged  <br/>\nmost decisively on place-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids find belonging online AND in real life, where they have more  <br/>\nsocial life than I had when I was in high school and clubs, and I was  <br/>\npretty busy.  The argument that belonging has only to do with place  <br/>\nis small.  Those Orion readers and writers are probably scattered all  <br/>\nover the world, but they consider themselves a community, I&#39;m sure.   <br/>\nThey have something in common with those who believe as they do, and  <br/>\nthey are clearly communicating by mail and by websites.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf computer students he had worked with in gifted and talented  <br/>\nprograms:  -=-They preferred discussing cultural diversity with  <br/>\nstudents on the other side of the world through the Internet rather  <br/>\nthan conversing with the school&#39;s own ESL students, many of whom came  <br/>\nfrom the very same parts of the world as the online correspondents.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHOW hypocritical.
