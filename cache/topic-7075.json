If I remember correctly chemistry used mostly algebra.  Personally I loved algebra so the high school and college textbooks worked fine for me....Trig was another story though.  Also my husband bought a softwared program called mathematics deluxe that has everything from pre-algebra to calc and statistics.  I haven&#39;t tried it out yet so it may be to &quot;drillish&quot;, but no one says you have to do all the problems.  I do believe though that learning the math as it comes up in chemistry may be better because then it has &quot;real world&quot; concept behind it.
