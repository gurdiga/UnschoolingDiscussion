I was going to get the book but<br/>\n+ it&#39;s on the high side<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought Gatto&#39;s book on the subject was high, too, but I&#39;m really glad I<br/>\nbought it.  I haven&#39;t finished it, though, so don&#39;t plan on getting this one<br/>\nyet.  His writing style is difficult for me to get through (and even his<br/>\nspeaking style is hard for me to follow), but I&#39;m determined to get through<br/>\nit eventually.  I had to make an unexpected trip out of town this weekend<br/>\nand grabbed 3 conference tapes I had of Gatto (conference was in Tacoma,<br/>\nWA).  I had *no* other distractions, so was able to follow OK.  His speech<br/>\npatterns are &quot;different&quot;....not exactly monotone, but his tone doesn&#39;t go up<br/>\nand down in the appropriate times or something.  At least not what I&#39;m used<br/>\nto in the midwest...  I&#39;ve seen him speak on 3 occasions (at least one of<br/>\nthem was a 4-day conference where he spoke several times) and he *READS* his<br/>\nspeeches; doesn&#39;t give them off the top of his head.  I think that&#39;s the<br/>\nproblem.  One session I went to of his he asked not to be taped and in this<br/>\nsession he was interesting to listen to....it *was* off the top of his head<br/>\nand he told lots of stories--he&#39;s at his best when he tells stories; when he<br/>\ngets &quot;sidetracked&quot; from what he wants to say.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n+ <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.educationnews.org/No%20Child%20Left%20Behind.htm\">http://www.educationnews.org/No%20Child%20Left%20Behind.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI just opened that page up and will read through it this afternoon--thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n--Leslie Moyer / Oklahoma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59497572,"authorName":"Sarah Carothers","from":"&quot;Sarah Carothers&quot; &lt;puddles@...&gt;","profile":"sarahjocarothers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Deliberated Dumbing Down","postDate":"1010971288","msgId":31055,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDNDIzMjk4LjAwMDAwMS4wMTI4NEBQMjAwLVM+","referencesHeader":"PFBHRUZKT0JOTklDRUJKSEpLUEtQTUVFUENKQUEuTGVzbGllTW95ZXJAZ2VvdGVjLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":30860,"nextInTopic":31062,"prevInTime":31054,"nextInTime":31056,"topicId":30860,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Leslie, That site is pretty disturbing!
