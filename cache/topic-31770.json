I have developed a tendency to avoid those who<br/>\nconsider themselves &quot;experts&quot;.  In gact,  one of the reasons I quit my part<br/>\ntime job at the local Alzheimer&#39;s Association invoved this &#39;philosophical&#39;<br/>\ndifference in approach between my supervisor and I.<br/>\n    I all my speaking with families coping with the disease,  groups,  and<br/>\nindividuals...I (and my co-workers)  emphasized that while we may have a<br/>\ndetailed knowledge and large information base...the individual/family is the<br/>\nonly one who can utilize that information in the &quot;best&quot; way for their<br/>\nparticular situation.  I usually reffered to them,  pr asked of them,  to<br/>\nbecome (if I felt they weren&#39;t *there* yet)  the *expert* of their<br/>\nsituation.  And to utilize the knowledge of professional as it fit their<br/>\nneeds.<br/>\n    My hope was to have that onus of responsibilty on them....mostly to<br/>\n&quot;empower&quot; them (now there&#39;s a Social Work word for ya!) to have confidence<br/>\nin dealing with Drs., Lawyers, Social Workers,  nurses,  etc....I tend to<br/>\nhave less respect for the ones who portray themselves as &quot;experts&quot;,  then<br/>\ndon&#39;t give a family or individual the time,  the listening ear,  etc.  Plus<br/>\nit puts themn in the &quot;I&#39;m *helping* you&quot; position rather than the &quot;I&#39;ll<br/>\nlisten and provide information that you may be able to help yourself&quot;<br/>\nposition where people are equals.<br/>\n    Those oare my thoughts on *experts*...they generalize to other areas.<br/>\nMore ramblings,<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31714,"nextTopicId":31773}}
