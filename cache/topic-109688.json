I said it&#39;s absolutely NOT true here.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was out here for a few weeks, and though she could&#39;ve found the same info <br/>\nwith google from her home, she&#39;s a busy person.

It is structured<br/>\nlogically in easily digestible steps in order to<br/>\nfacilitate learning. Essentially, the job of the<br/>\nstudent is to follow a learning sequence that is<br/>\npredetermined. But when children learn<br/>\ninformally, they seem to do the opposite and<br/>\nimpose their own sequence on what they learn.<br/>\nCurriculum logic and child logic do not equate.<br/>\nChild logic is individual and determined by the<br/>\ncomplex and dynamic interplay between the childs<br/>\nexisting level of knowledge and incoming<br/>\ninformation, mediated by interest, motivation,<br/>\ncuriosity or desire to take on a challenge. Its<br/>\nas if each child has his or her own theory of<br/>\nlearning. It is quite efficient because new<br/>\nknowledge and understanding are only assimilated<br/>\nwhen they extend existing knowledge. The converse<br/>\nequally contributes to the efficiency of informal<br/>\nlearning  when new material is unlikely to<br/>\ndovetail into and extend knowledge or<br/>\nunderstanding it is discarded. This utterly<br/>\ncontradicts conventional school learning in which<br/>\nstudents are expected to persevere when they do<br/>\nnot comprehend, often acquiring no more than a<br/>\nsuperficial level of understanding, what has been<br/>\ncalled surface learning (Biggs, 1987). Informal<br/>\nlearning therefore follows a kind of fuzzy and<br/>\nnon-linear logic that is particular to each<br/>\nchild. It has a parallel in the childs<br/>\nacquisition of language, learned in a similar<br/>\nfashion and equally individualistic (Crystal,<br/>\n1976). Perhaps informal learning is better suited<br/>\nto the innumerable connections and networks in<br/>\nthe cerebral cortex.
