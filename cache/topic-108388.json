They rode down on their 4 <br/>\nwheelers.  While dad stayed outside and visited with my dh, nephew <br/>\ncame in to play.  He knows where all the cool stuff is in the house, <br/>\nso came in asking to play computer.  I honestly answered him saying I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know what my own daughters had loaded onto the computer in <br/>\nquestion (meaning I didn&#39;t think his favorite Hot Wheels game of ours <br/>\nwas loaded on and unfortunately I was in the middle of dinner and <br/>\nbabysitting my grandbaby, so felt a bit too busy to stop everything <br/>\nand load the game for him in the event).  I suggested, however, <br/>\nanother of his favorite things to do at our house, play Nintendo.  <br/>\nThe look he gave me made me ask him if he was in trouble and grounded <br/>\nfrom the video games.  He said no.  I went over and turned on the <br/>\nsystem and he was happy.  When asking his dad about it later, his <br/>\ndad&#39;s only comment was &quot;He&#39;s always getting in trouble for <br/>\nsomething.&quot;  A few short years ago, he was a bright inquisitive <br/>\nenergetic kid.  Now he&#39;s a trouble maker?  It is sad to see this <br/>\ngoing on before your very eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSally</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108264,"nextTopicId":108387}}
