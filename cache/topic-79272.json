The rules <br/>\ndo seem harsh and arbitrary, but they are in place for safety and business <br/>\nreasons.   Although not all kids, maybe not even many kids, will be sneaky and <br/>\nunethical, some will.   Kids will try to sneak in the rink without paying when <br/>\nanother person goes in ( hence getting buzzed in)  Kids will go in and out of <br/>\nthe rink, goof off outside, maybe get hurt outside or damage property..hence <br/>\nhaving to pay to get back in.   When a person stops on the rink, it is <br/>\npotentially dangerous for themselves and other skaters, it&#39;s difficult to stop on a <br/>\ndime in skates.  Kids at the rinks are skating on different levels, some may get <br/>\nbored with continuous free skate, so other activities are provided to keep <br/>\nall the customers happy.   You also have to keep in mind that most kids at the <br/>\nskating rink are dropped off and left with no adult supervision, other than the <br/>\nrink employees.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of rules do suck, and a lot of them are really not needed, but they are <br/>\nin place to protect the business from law suits and the customers from the <br/>\nfew folks that do not behave appropiately.   Sometimes we forget that the rest <br/>\nof the world does not operate on unschooling principles.   We take for granted <br/>\nthat folks will always do the right thing.  I get caught up in that bubble <br/>\nsometimes too.    Going on a homeschool day would probably be a lot better.. at <br/>\nleast you would have some other familes to commiserate with about the rules..<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4257114,"authorName":"Cathy Hilde","from":"&quot;Cathy Hilde&quot; &lt;childe@...&gt;","profile":"cathyhilde","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-Discussion] Rules and Regulations at the Roller Rink","postDate":"1062028289","msgId":79284,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE5DQkJMUElPR0pQRUhFR0lPUENLR0VQTUpDQUEuY2hpbGRlQHNlcnZpY2VwYXBlci5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGJpamE5bitnNGRrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":79272,"nextInTopic":79287,"prevInTime":79283,"nextInTime":79285,"topicId":79272,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We frequent three rinks in our area and none are this rigid.
