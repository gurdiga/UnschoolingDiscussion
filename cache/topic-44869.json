My old vet which is a teaching <br/>\ncenter as well became extremely expensive and you saw someone different <br/>\nevery time you went. We then tried two other vets that just didn&#39;t sit well <br/>\nwith me. I need someone to listen to me and what I know about my animals, <br/>\nthen I&#39;ll ask what I don&#39;t. We finally found a one vet practice just down <br/>\nthe road and if I knew of a typical country vet, this guy would be it. He <br/>\nlistens and when our bullmastiff puppy came down with mange, he was the only <br/>\none that let us treat it the way we wanted to without trying to force his <br/>\nways.

It takes a lot out of a dog and if <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t young and healthy, it&#39;s not the best for the animal. If it&#39;s an <br/>\nold dog who hasn&#39;t been given a heartworm preventative, then a simple blood <br/>\ntest will tell you if they have it or not. If not, then the heartworm meds <br/>\nare no big deal. But that last part is a matter of decision also. Our older <br/>\nLab only went out for walks as we didn&#39;t have  a fenced in yard at that <br/>\ntime. I sprayed him down with Adams before he left the house and didn&#39;t use <br/>\nheartworm meds on him in his older age.

Didn&#39;t that stuff kill a bunch of cats and cause<br/>\nseizures in dogs.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah I guess similar to Frontline and just like with any med, there are <br/>\nalways contraindications that could lead to death.

You can give your dog heartworm preventative<br/>\nmedicine which protects the dogs from the heartworm parasite and other<br/>\nparasites/worms as well. My vet strongly recommended that we give our dog<br/>\nheartworm pills even though we hardly have any mosquitos here in Phoenix<br/>\n(AZ). Apparently, once the dog gets a heartworm, it is very  hard to treat<br/>\nand can be deadly - so prevention is key.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44881,"nextTopicId":44914}}
