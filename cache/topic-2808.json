She is showing some of the same symptoms...the <br/>\ndifference for her is that she is a rhythmic gymnast and trains 5 hours a <br/>\nday, 6 days a week, so that takes up a lot of her time.  When she comes home, <br/>\nthough, it&#39;s right to the computer to check her mail and talk with her <br/>\nfriends (some of whom she just left at the gym!!).  She doesn&#39;t watch much <br/>\nTV, but music is important to her (and all of her friends).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI look at what she does though and I can put &quot;education&quot; of some sort to <br/>\nalmost everything.....gym = physical education; computer time = reading, <br/>\nwriting composition, spelling and typing skills; gymnastics notebook that she <br/>\nis required by coach to keep = handwriting, spelling, some French terms; gym <br/>\ntime = socialization; injuries = anatomy and physiology and kinesiology.

We recently got back from vacation and that took care of history, <br/>\ngeology, social studies and American Literature (we went to Key West and <br/>\nstudied the history and geology of the Keys, visited Hemingway&#39;s home, etc.). <br/>\n We will take the occasional trip to our Science Museum, but, compared to <br/>\nothers we&#39;ve been in, it&#39;s not so hot and really doesn&#39;t hold much of <br/>\nanything interesting in it...so, for science we get the Experiment of the <br/>\nWeek from Robert Krampf emailed to us.....they&#39;re just simple science <br/>\nexperiments that you can do at home, but I put them in her folder and that <br/>\ntakes care of Science.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that maybe what we&#39;re experiencing right now is just 14yo stuff ... <br/>\nand I&#39;m not sure it isn&#39;t happening to all of them!!

After all, we adults have gaps in our education...things we have <br/>\nlearned and forgotten or things we never learned.  What do WE do if we find <br/>\nwe have to learn about something?  We go out and find someone or something to <br/>\nteach us.....our kids will do that too.
