For<br/>\n+ example, as<br/>\n+ I&#39;m wasting away in Bartlesville next weekend at the in-laws, you wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n+ be close by, would you? Havanese are just the cutest; did you get yours<br/>\n+ around there? Just curious...<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m quite close to Bartlesville--in Skiatook (about 30 minutes south of<br/>\nB&#39;ville)--and would love meeting you.  We&#39;ll be around all weekend, I think.<br/>\nMy phone number is 918-396-0108 (it is long distance from B&#39;ville).  I&#39;m<br/>\ntrying to make plans with some (mostly) unschooling friends for a small<br/>\nparty, but not yet sure if we&#39;re going to try to do that New Year&#39;s Eve or<br/>\nnext weekend, but if you&#39;re here then you&#39;re welcome to come to that, too.<br/>\nIt&#39;s just 3 other families...  Either way--give me a call!  Beware,<br/>\nthough....if you meet Sparky in person it will be enough to push you over<br/>\nthe edge from &quot;considering&quot; into &quot;doing&quot;.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI did get my Havanese here--there is a small family breeder in Broken Arrow<br/>\n(Tulsa suburb).  They are homeschoolers, too, in fact....and a<br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling friend of mine bought the sibling of the puppy we<br/>\ngot.  There must be some sort of attraction there...  They don&#39;t have any<br/>\nmore pups from this litter, but I think they have two females, so may have<br/>\npups again soon-ish.  I know there&#39;s a breeder in Ardmore, too, who says she<br/>\nwill have pups mid-summer, but those are the only ones I know about in<br/>\nOklahoma so far.  Where do you live, Karen?  I&#39;m *considering* breeding,<br/>\ntoo, but it will be at least 2 years before we had pups....probably more<br/>\nlike 3 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI notice that Sarah said she was going to attach a photo but there was no<br/>\nattachment.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s because the list doesn&#39;t accept them or<br/>\nif she forgot or had a problem, but I&#39;ll try attaching a (small) photo of<br/>\nSparky, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really will try participating in some of the more intellectual<br/>\nconversation soon.  :-)  My daughter&#39;s birthday is today and she has 5 girls<br/>\nover for a party right now, so I&#39;m a little distracted.  Enjoying the<br/>\nconversation here, though....<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie Moyer / Oklahoma<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_<br/>\n<br/>\n\r<br/>\n_________________________________________________________\r<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?\r<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30508,"nextTopicId":30512}}
