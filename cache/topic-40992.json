I know exactly what you are <br/>\nsaying about the extracurricular, the blind leading the blind, and I agree <br/>\nwith you.

To claim <br/>\nto love Jesus but hate the established religion is OK, except for the fact <br/>\nthat the established religion became just that the moment the record got <br/>\nwritten and began circulating as the Word of God in the 1st Century. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo though you might put off going to your pastor, or any other Bible scholar, <br/>\nfor advice, the very Bible you personally search to find answers is the <br/>\nresult of tradition.  Does that mean it is any less true? Not at all. Martin <br/>\nLuther relied upon his sole private reading and understanding of the <br/>\nScriptures -- sola scriptura, after all. But even he knew he must at least <br/>\npick and choose his tradition.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, unless you&#39;re some sort of Gnostic, the record of the Jesus <br/>\nyou love is the result of a tradition which is the result of people following <br/>\npeople.

But I do find there to be alot of extracurricular human tradition - along with ideas of things like heaven and hell that stem from Greek Mythology, Philosophy and the blending of beliefs to create a &quot;religion&quot; - which on the face is based on the Bible - but the preconceived notions are so strong that one cannot get by them. An example is the Pope. - I apologize if I offend anyone here - but he is supposed to be God&#39;s repetitive on Earth - the Holy Father...and yet the Bible says &quot;Call no man thy Father, save the Father which is in Heaven&quot;. So masses follow him - take what he says as infallible - and are deeply rooted in tradition - <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the great things about Jesus was that he really knew what motivated people. How else could he excuse those who under the Jewish Law should have been stoned - and yet come down hard on the scribes and Pharisees? We are to model our character after Him, and it takes working it out. Thinking about what he says, and applying it. - Not just listening to the Sunday morning sermon and going about our routine. It is a personal endeavor. I agree wholeheartedly we should be following Jesus - but he never said - go to your pastor for all the answers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rsale515@...\">rsale515@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2002 12:31 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: 2239 - Ned back to Tia re HSLDA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 8/14/2002 8:40:07 AM Pacific Daylight Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bacwoodz@...\">bacwoodz@...</a> writes: <br/>\n  &gt; I think it&#39;s more of a sin to be a follower...(following pastor..or <br/>\n  &gt; whatever) without doing your own studying, thinking, working it out<br/>\n<br/>\n  Heather,<br/>\n<br/>\n  How do you reconcile this with Jesus&#39; commandment to &quot;Follow Me&quot;?

And they represent themselves as representing all or most hs, <br/>\nwhich is certainly not true.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;From where I sit, the HSLDA is helping by being a visible advocate and<br/>\n&gt;lobbyist, but along the way, they can&#39;t help but antagonize plenty of folks<br/>\n&gt;because ot their religious slant and political/legal tactics that seem to<br/>\n&gt;favor them instead of parents, sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This sentence seems pretty contradictory to me.  They&#39;re helping by <br/>\nlobbying but antagonizing many of the people they&#39;re supposed to be <br/>\nlobbying for?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What seems to happen is that the HSLDA divides groups of parents from each<br/>\n&gt;other on issues -- christians versus all the rest. I don&#39;t know if it can be<br/>\n&gt;really blamed on the org or not. Christians for one reason or another, seem<br/>\n&gt;to like state regulations. I can&#39;t figure that out. The HSLDA seems to be<br/>\n&gt;behind that. (if there were none, then what would all those lawyers fight<br/>\n&gt;against?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly!  The harder it seems to legally homeschool, the more members <br/>\nthey&#39;ll get, and the more money they can channel into their political cause.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;On balance, I&#39;d say HSLDA is doing more good than harm, but in states where<br/>\n&gt;the climate is favorable for homeschooling, I see no need to join, and that<br/>\n&gt;means many states. Homeschooling is getting large enough to have lots of<br/>\n&gt;lawyers among its practitioners. Who needs outsiders?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly.  I think they might be doing some good for people just like them <br/>\nand only in the unfavourable states.  The rest is harm.  I just hope they <br/>\nstay the h*ll out of BC.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you think of me is none of my business.<br/>\n*********************************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: 2239 - Ned back to Tia re HSLDA","postDate":"1029344829","msgId":41055,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFqZTJudCt0amF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE4Yy5jNmEyZjcxLjJhOGJkZmQ1QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":41041,"nextInTopic":41059,"prevInTime":41054,"nextInTime":41056,"topicId":40992,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ll take a stab at that.

We don t have to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-837423057\">I&#39;ll take a stab at that.  Christians are supposed to follow Jesus.  <br/>\nBut Jesus offers freedom to those who accept him as Lord and Savior.  <br/>\nWe don&#39;t have to follow all kinds of laws.  All that we are supposed <br/>\nto do is summed up by loving the Lord with all our hearts soul mind <br/>\nand strength and loving our neighbor as ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, in the old testament, people needed to follow a sabath.  <br/>\nThere were all kinds of rules about the sabbath.  How far you could <br/>\nwalk, you couldn&#39;t work, even to light a fire, etc.  Now for some <br/>\nweird reason, many Christians don&#39;t get it when Jesus says that He is <br/>\nnow our Sabbath rest.  We are to rest from our attempts at good works <br/>\nin Him.  Instead, many Christians teach their kids that they need to <br/>\nfollow the 10 commandments (even though we&#39;re not under the law <br/>\nanymore) and that one of those commandments means to remember the <br/>\nSabbath and keep it Holy by going to Sunday School and Church on <br/>\nSundays!!!???!!!  The church they go to has its origins in paganism, <br/>\nright down to the three point sermon, building with the steeple on <br/>\ntop, and choir.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut we are to follow Him, by loving.  We show our love to Him by <br/>\nmeeting with others to praise Him.  We don&#39;t pray and sing praises <br/>\nbecause we have to, but because we love Him and we want to.  We love <br/>\nothers by being a friend to them and helping those in need.  Again, <br/>\nnot out of a sense of obligation  but because God has shown us how <br/>\ngood love is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Jesus created us as individuals, with individual likes and <br/>\ndislikes, different talents, and different plans for our lives.  I do <br/>\nbelieve that God has a definite plan for our lives.  That&#39;s part of <br/>\nwhat unschooling is for me--getting out of the way so that the Holy <br/>\nSpirit can guide the child&#39;s life.  Each person was made to do <br/>\nsomething special in the universe and only God knows which puzzle <br/>\npieces he needs to put his part of the puzzle together completely. <br/>\nThe Bible says to train up a child in the way HE should go, and the <br/>\nway HE should go is probably going to be different than the way <br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s child should go.  God could have made us clones, but <br/>\nHe didn&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Jesus did say that He was THE way, THE truth, and THE life, and <br/>\nthat no one comes to the Father except through Him.  I do believe <br/>\nthat to be true.  Just like I believe that unschooling is THE way to <br/>\neducate a child.  I do believe in absolute rights and wrongs.  But <br/>\nit&#39;s also true that in Christ, there is so much more freedom, so much <br/>\nmore individuality, so much more love.  It&#39;s so hard to see the true <br/>\npicture of Christianity, as Christ intended, without seeing the stuff <br/>\nthat the institutional church has added to the picture.  <br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do you reconcile this with Jesus&#39; commandment to &quot;Follow Me&quot;? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>He doesn&#39;t <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; say, &quot;Go study, work it out, see if I&#39;m the real deal, and then <br/>\n </span></blockquote>follow me if <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I line up with your perspective.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is what bothers most people about Christianity, and they use <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; fundamentalists as whipping boys.

Alas, even at this list!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you made the accusation toward fundy Christians, and it&#39;s clear you &quot;have <br/>\nissues&quot; with them. So I&#39;ll go with that, because I think you are wrong. The <br/>\nbottom line, from your perspective, is that the fear of hell is what <br/>\nmotivates them. Fear is indeed a dangerous and harmful motivator. But there <br/>\nare fears other than hell that motivate all of us, not just the Christians. <br/>\nWhat about the fear of being unhip; poor; without answers; forsaken; sick; <br/>\nrejected; alone; losing your children; not being able to unschool; etc? Hell <br/>\nis only one of a million fears. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut you think that fear of hell, and slavish devotion to others is what <br/>\nmotivates fundamentalist C&#39;s: Consider this: The opposite of fear is love. <br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s love that motivates them. And that what appears as fear, may in <br/>\nfact be a love of things like devotion, order, absolute truth, hierarchies of <br/>\nvalue in art, method, life, eternal justice, God. Moreover, what appears to <br/>\nbe slavish succumbing, may in fact be devotion. You may despise the object of <br/>\ntheir devotion, but are you not devoted to someone, something? <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso consider that the belief that there is order in the universe, and order <br/>\nin our souls, and that this order is manifested everywhere, is as old as the <br/>\nhills -- even older! (The great Eric Voegelin made it his life&#39;s work to <br/>\nstudy this revelation of order. What he found regarding ancient Israel is <br/>\nstaggering -- a truly blessed people. I digress.) Christians assume this <br/>\norder, and look to see that some of it gets manifest in the political realm. <br/>\nThat&#39;s not unusual, Sandra, it&#39;s the story of humans.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fear of hell is not peculiar to fundamentalist Christians, and I doubt it <br/>\nis what motivates them to belong to HSLDA, or Promise Keepers, or any other <br/>\norganization. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour remarks above betray that you fancy yourself a freethinker.

Twenty-five years ago, the picture was grim compared to today, even<br/>\nthough it&#39;s still bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nWho doesn&#39;t have something against lawyers? HSLDA is run by lawyers as a<br/>\nbusiness. That&#39;s strike one and two. They have a conflict of interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn CT, fifteen years ago, school boards had the say in whether a family<br/>\ncould homeschool or not. I was not involved then, but when our Hsing org<br/>\nwanted to change that, the head of HSLDA came and made a case to the State<br/>\nSchool Board in an effort that he claimed would help. His presentation was<br/>\nnot accepted even by CT homeschoolers, so it created much confusion at the<br/>\ntime. Ultimately, the parents themselves took charge of the negotiations and<br/>\nwere able to make the state eliminate its regulations, so that now, there is<br/>\nreally no regulation at all for homeschoolers here, and no law that uses the<br/>\nword homeschooling.  That might be up for a redux next year again, since we<br/>\nwere attacked this year by superintendents trying to create restrictions.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom where I sit, the HSLDA is helping by being a visible advocate and<br/>\nlobbyist, but along the way, they can&#39;t help but antagonize plenty of folks<br/>\nbecause ot their religious slant and political/legal tactics that seem to<br/>\nfavor them instead of parents, sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat seems to happen is that the HSLDA divides groups of parents from each<br/>\nother on issues -- christians versus all the rest. I don&#39;t know if it can be<br/>\nreally blamed on the org or not. Christians for one reason or another, seem<br/>\nto like state regulations. I can&#39;t figure that out. The HSLDA seems to be<br/>\nbehind that. (if there were none, then what would all those lawyers fight<br/>\nagainst? <br/>\n<br/>\nOn balance, I&#39;d say HSLDA is doing more good than harm, but in states where<br/>\nthe climate is favorable for homeschooling, I see no need to join, and that<br/>\nmeans many states. Homeschooling is getting large enough to have lots of<br/>\nlawyers among its practitioners. Who needs outsiders?<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41119,"nextTopicId":41197}}
