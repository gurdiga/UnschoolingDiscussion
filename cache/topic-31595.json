I<br/>\nknow.  I&#39;ve been there.  My son is 9 and we have been going through the same<br/>\nthing.  I think it must be harder when the kids are going from being<br/>\ncontrolled to making their own decisions.  Or perhaps its a boy thing<br/>\nbecause both of my boys are having many more issues than any of my 3 girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been about a year since the controls came off.  We have never been a<br/>\nreal controlling house but we saw where we had made some fairly arbitrary<br/>\n&quot;rules&quot; and worked to change that.  Zach initially did pretty well as far as<br/>\nself regulating but then it seemed that no matter where the line was drawn<br/>\n(not being rude and hurtful to people) it was a major battle.  He wouldn&#39;t<br/>\ngo to bed at night.  We would say fine but please turn out the lights.  When<br/>\nwe got up in the morning, EVERY light would be on REPEATEDLY.  He would get<br/>\nout dh&#39;s tools and dh would say great but please put them back when you are<br/>\ndone.  I don&#39;t think they were EVER put back without it becoming a big<br/>\nargument over doing what you say you&#39;ll do.  I would ask him to do some<br/>\nminor thing, like please pick up his jacket that he threw in the kitchen<br/>\nfloor and I would just get a list of reasons why he didn&#39;t have to.  Zach<br/>\nwould commit to projects for 4-H, things that infringed on other people in<br/>\nthe club if he didn&#39;t do them, I would remind him and then he would get mad<br/>\nat me for bringing it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt got to where I didn&#39;t want to spend time with him, didn&#39;t want to talk<br/>\nwith him because no matter what, he tried to turn it into an argument. He<br/>\nwould ask what time it was, I would look at the clock and tell him just<br/>\nabout 10:00, he would then proceed to tell me how I&#39;m wrong that it is 9:59.<br/>\nHe would get accidentally jostled by a younger sibling and yell at them.  I<br/>\nwould touch his shoulder and point out that it was an accident.  Zach would<br/>\njerk away from me and yell at me.  This got worse and worse over months.  I<br/>\nfinally lost it.  Told him I refused to be treated that way by anyone, that<br/>\nI refused to have my children treated that way by anyone including him,<br/>\npointed out how I treat him with respect but that I refused to be his<br/>\nwhipping boy. (Reading back over this it sounds like I was calm,  I wasn&#39;t.<br/>\nI really lost it....not something I&#39;m proud of)<br/>\n<br/>\nZach has for now moved back into my structuring a lot of his life.  It has<br/>\nbeen 2 days and he truly seems happier.  I don&#39;t know what that means.  Is<br/>\nthe problem the lack of imposed structure or is it an adoption issue related<br/>\nto birth mom having another child?  Did the lack of structure somehow equal<br/>\nloss of love to him?  Did he act ugly to me to try to get the structure<br/>\n(love) back and it pushed me farther away?  Should I have just hugged him<br/>\nanyway (even though when I did he would just pull away)?  Should my letting<br/>\ngo have been much more gradual?  I don&#39;t know the answers to any of it.

I think the definition<br/>\nends there. Other decisions that you make regarding your children&#39;s limits<br/>\nor parenting are separate issues.  Granted, a lot of things overlap and<br/>\nthere are many gray areas, but I would consider anyone who allows their<br/>\nchildren to be self-directed in their education as unschool.  I think that<br/>\ncan include people who do not have a t.v. or choose to limit t.v or people<br/>\nwho make their children brush their teeth or straighten up a room.  Every<br/>\nchild&#39;s environment is controlled to some extent.  I think the line is drawn<br/>\nwhen someone forces their child to do school work, including forced reading,<br/>\ngames, math, listening to stories that they do not choose, copy work, work<br/>\nsheets, practicing an instrument, etc.  I didn&#39;t realize that other people<br/>\ndidn&#39;t define unschooling similarly.  From all the books I have read<br/>\nconcerning unschooling, that is what I have surmised.  Of course, there is<br/>\nalways room for other people to interpret things differently, however, after<br/>\nbeing on unschooling lists for the last few years, that is what I understand<br/>\nmost other unschoolers to believe too.<br/>\n<br/>\nYMMV,<br/>\nAngela in Maine<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling@...\">unschooling@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy Unschooling Page!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/autonomousangela\">http://www.geocities.com/autonomousangela</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.&quot;  -<br/>\nWilliam Butler Yeats<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85994576,"authorName":"Kolleen","from":"Kolleen &lt;Kolleen@...&gt;","profile":"kaydeecross","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Balance","postDate":"1012177364","msgId":31686,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMTI4MDAyMS5nMFMwTGpFRTAyMjEyM0BueWNzbXRwMm91dC5yZGMtbnljLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":31676,"nextInTopic":31692,"prevInTime":31685,"nextInTime":31687,"topicId":31595,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I know <br/>\n&gt;some people say that unschooling is about freedom and there is no good or <br/>\n&gt;bad time spent. So if I am not way off on my understanding of that being <br/>\n&gt;an unschooling philosophy then answer me this. Other than some basic <br/>\n&gt;helping out around the house, what responsibilities should our unschooled <br/>\n&gt;kids have?  And I know most will say &quot;what ever they choose&quot; but in the <br/>\n&gt;past I could relate their ps time as their job. What do they need to learn <br/>\n&gt;to balance in their lives?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok, now that they&#39;re unschooling, their learning time isn&#39;t so precisely <br/>\nset out as it was when they went to school.  But they&#39;re still learning and <br/>\ngrowing, and isn&#39;t that still their main job?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the people on this list handle the idea of chores in a lot of <br/>\ndifferent ways.  I think I&#39;m somewhere near the middle.  I do insist on one <br/>\nkitchen chore daily.  I figure Rod earns the money for the meal.  I buy the <br/>\ngroceries and cook it.  Lars can do *something* to help with either prep or <br/>\nclean up.  We ask him to do other things, but it&#39;s more asking than <br/>\ninsisting.  I ask him to bring in firewood and split kindling when Rod <br/>\nisn&#39;t around, because I can&#39;t do it without a lot of pain.  Rod asks for <br/>\nhelp when he needs it.  I don&#39;t worry about his room, and it gets cleaned <br/>\nup more often than when I hassled him about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I would love to sit here on my computer and read all 200 messages that I <br/>\n&gt;got today (I need to unsubscribe to some lists) but I have to balance this <br/>\n&gt;desire with the other things that need to get done.  I make a deal with <br/>\n&gt;myself that I will accomplish x or y before I sit down at the computer and <br/>\n&gt;allow myself x amount of time, etc.  The freedom I have is to make the <br/>\n&gt;deals with myself.  No one is telling me how much time or when I can have <br/>\n&gt;the computer and some days I might say bag it to my other stuff and veg <br/>\n&gt;for a little bit.  This is the same freedom I feel my kids should have.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.  But I sometimes talk with Lars about my procrastination tendencies <br/>\nand the various tricks I use to get my backside moving.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;How can they learn to balance their desires and responsibilities in a life <br/>\n&gt;so free of responsibilities?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think they gradually take on the responsibilities themselves.  When Lars <br/>\nisn&#39;t working, he stays up late, sleeps in, and generally takes it <br/>\neasy.  When he&#39;s working, he makes his lunch and gets his gear together in <br/>\nthe evening and then goes to bed early.  He gets up cheerfully in the <br/>\nmorning, because he&#39;s chosen to do this.  Even when he doesn&#39;t feel like <br/>\ngetting up and going to work, he does anyway because he&#39;s made a commitment <br/>\nto his dad to be there.  At 14, his work habits and attitudes are better <br/>\nthan any of his older sibs (who went to school) and better than many of the <br/>\nother employees.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\nEleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59432230,"authorName":"joanna514","from":"&quot;joanna514&quot; &lt;Wilkinson6@...&gt;","profile":"joanna514","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Balance","postDate":"1012155181","msgId":31625,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEzMWZ2ZCtoa2tlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNjYwMWMxYTc0ZCRhOTAwYjIwMCQwMzAxYThjMEBvZmZpY2U+"},"prevInTopic":31622,"nextInTopic":31676,"prevInTime":31624,"nextInTime":31626,"topicId":31595,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"(I m using thriving deliberately as a possibly controversial term.) ...

But here goes anyway:<br/>\nI think there is a difference between unschooling and unparenting.  I <br/>\nthink that children should have household responsibilities.  How you <br/>\narrive at the breakdown of who does what and what the consequences <br/>\nare is going to be different from family to family.  And it is <br/>\ntotally unrelated to what they choose to learn outside the scope of <br/>\nfamily life.  My kids HAD to learn to cook and do laundry.  The don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to learn algebra or the history of the US.

I&#39;ll bet seeing the amount of time I spend on email will<br/>\n+be scary!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n+Tia<br/>\n<br/>\nYou bring up something that I have been thinking about lately.  I know some people say that unschooling is about freedom and there is no good or bad time spent. So if I am not way off on my understanding of that being an unschooling philosophy then answer me this. Other than some basic helping out around the house, what responsibilities should our unschooled kids have?  And I know most will say &quot;what ever they choose&quot; but in the past I could relate their ps time as their job. What do they need to learn to balance in their lives? <br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to sit here on my computer and read all 200 messages that I got today (I need to unsubscribe to some lists) but I have to balance this desire with the other things that need to get done.  I make a deal with myself that I will accomplish x or y before I sit down at the computer and allow myself x amount of time, etc.  The freedom I have is to make the deals with myself.  No one is telling me how much time or when I can have the computer and some days I might say bag it to my other stuff and veg for a little bit.  This is the same freedom I feel my kids should have.  <br/>\nHow can they learn to balance their desires and responsibilities in a life so free of responsibilities?<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Yahoo!
