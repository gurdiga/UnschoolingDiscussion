He used to be a happy little boy, before going to school. We started homeschooling in Feb of  this year. That didnt work so I looked different ways to do this and found unschooling. He is starting to act like the child I used to know and we are just taking it one day at a time. I,m so glad I found you guys. Its going to take awhile for both of us, but we are on the right trail. I hope we get to come to the SC conference. I&#39;m trying to get the money to go, but we are on a limited income. Maybe a work scholorship would help, if I knew who to talk to about this. Do you know who I could contact about it? I seen this on one of the other posts before. I&#39;m a little scared to drive the distance with just bj and myself, but I think we will be okay. We will be coming from Chattanooga if we get to go. Hope to meet everyone then. B.J. says thanks and I say thanks.
