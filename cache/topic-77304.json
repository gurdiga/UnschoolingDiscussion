Where is the peace in <br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; type of reply? Where is the love & understanding. Intolerance and <br/>\n&gt; impatience<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t tools for teaching and I am here to learn.I will make mistakes <br/>\n&gt; in my<br/>\n&gt; parenting path and I will disagree with people here as we are all not <br/>\n&gt; alike<br/>\n&gt; nor are our styles of &quot;parenting&quot; and that should all be ok.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I shouldn&#39;t feel afraid to post in fear I&#39;ll get slammed by certain <br/>\n&gt; members<br/>\n&gt; like Oom. I didn&#39;t feel she was accusing or labeling anyone in <br/>\n&gt; particular,<br/>\n&gt; just sharing an opinion. So why attack? I&#39;m positive, I too, will get a <br/>\n&gt; heap<br/>\n&gt; of flaming, but I find this terribly uncomfortable and unfair. I&#39;d be <br/>\n&gt; much<br/>\n&gt; more willing to listen to a non-reactionary gentle reply. It&#39;s a bit <br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt; the pot calling the kettle black to accuse of attack and then retaliate <br/>\n&gt; by<br/>\n&gt; attacking back as well. Non-reaction is an emotionally adult way to <br/>\n&gt; handle<br/>\n&gt; such things, not more insults and accusations or assumptions. Give the <br/>\n&gt; topic<br/>\n&gt; up Oom, you don&#39;t have a chance.
