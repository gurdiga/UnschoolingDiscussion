I&#39;m curious <br/>\nif it was used on one of his t.v. programs (he usually watches kids <br/>\nchannels only).  or was it a piece of literature?  The only b / w <br/>\nmovie we have watched lately was Casablanca.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I know what kind of movies this genre belongs too.  DOA <br/>\nsounds distinctly familiar. Perhaps we should rent one or two to <br/>\nillustrate them for him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, he is suseptible to moods and perhaps the genre itself is <br/>\nnot quite appropriate to him.  If the movie is too dark it may be <br/>\nsomething to research first and explain the  styling and plot.  He <br/>\nlikes these discussions and I value them because they are so rare.<br/>\n<br/>\nm</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95784,"nextTopicId":95811}}
