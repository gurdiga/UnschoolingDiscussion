As a student I never liked to read. I was placed at a 3rd grade reading level when I was in 9th grade, (this was after being placed in advanced English for the 3 years before), and I was a horrible speller. I really just didn&#39;t care to read or spell correctly. I really didn&#39;t have any reason to. It wasn&#39;t until about age 25 or so, that I wanted to read a book, just for me. It didn&#39;t take me much time to become a better reader. Now, I love to read, I read all the time. And I have gotten to be a better speller, &lt;g&gt; (not perfect, but improved). The truth is, it never meant anything to me until then. Perhaps if I had been unschooled I would have enjoyed it sooner, I wouldn&#39;t have felt like I &quot;had&quot; to read it for a school book report or assignment. I know when I was very young, before school age, I enjoyed reading. I would &quot;read&quot; stories that had been read to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust food for thought,<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36794,"nextTopicId":36840}}
