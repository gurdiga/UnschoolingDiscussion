I was going to concentrate on blackberries, but I am far too curious <br/>\nand had to continue reading!

Let me explain <br/>\na bit and hope I wont get slammed. This is not necessarily my viewpoint <br/>\nthough I am pro life. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo people who believe that really is a child inside that there womb, then to <br/>\ntake that life truly is murder. To people who believe that ... children are <br/>\ngoing in the clinics alive and coming out dead. That is what they see. To <br/>\nthem ... standing by and watching that is no different then standing by and <br/>\nwatching a holocaust. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is why this issue won&#39;t go away. Pro choice people passionately believe <br/>\nthey are right and pro life people passionately believe they are right. you <br/>\nhave an impasse no matter how you look at it. <br/>\n<br/>\nBack to Blackberries:) <br/>\nTeri <br/>\n<br/>\nCo-author of &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.championpress.com/unschoolingmain.html&quot;\">http://www.championpress.com/unschoolingmain.html&quot;</a>&gt;<br/>\nChristian Unschooling: growing your child in the freedom of Christ&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\nPre-order&#39;s available now! <br/>\nAssistant Editor of &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Seedling&quot;\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Seedling&quot;</a>&gt;eGroups : <br/>\nSeedling&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\nFor more information see:<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.inspirit.com.au/unschooling/default.htm&quot;\">http://www.inspirit.com.au/unschooling/default.htm&quot;</a>&gt;Homeschooling - <br/>\nChristian Unschooling - Natural Learning&lt;/A&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bonnie Painter","from":"&quot;Bonnie Painter&quot; &lt;bonniepainter@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"n-Ol6qU62WyASYO5btc3TfsPPV_2cRFnHtq_YQIEb36VrkgKfOED1UiQ2lx42hFRC3qOJ30WR7xEBMagMWJvuRUrn-2or_DwFl0XRei2vhdTl8I","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 962","postDate":"980988039","msgId":15646,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY1Mm83NlVhaVJOaEZDZnl3RXMwMDAwMTU5MEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":15634,"nextInTopic":15654,"prevInTime":15645,"nextInTime":15647,"topicId":15573,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here, here. ... _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2095150104\">Here, here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wendalina1@...\">Wendalina1@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 962<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 31 Jan 2001 17:57:28 EST<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I personally don&#39;t think that all pro-life people are fanatics but I do<br/>\n&gt;believe that they are pushing their beliefs on others if they want abortion<br/>\n&gt;to be illegal.
