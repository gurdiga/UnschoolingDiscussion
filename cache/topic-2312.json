We bought a white board for our hallway and we list things that <br/>\nneed to be done on it.  Anybody can write something on the list.  Then, a <br/>\ncouple of times a day, we all work together and choose something on the list <br/>\nand do it.  Sometimes we don&#39;t use the list...it&#39;s just obvious what needs to <br/>\nbe done.

And the <br/>\nlist never really gets done.

But, no<br/>\nmatter what chart or list or system I devised, it worked for a few days or a<br/>\nweek, and then completely fell apart. It was always back to me nagging the<br/>\nboys to do their assigned or randomly picked work, which is just plain<br/>\nfrustrating as you probably know. I really hate the atmosphere that nagging<br/>\ncreates in a household. I don&#39;t nag at my husband, I hate to be nagged at,<br/>\nand I know my kids hate it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason why I wanted my kids to do chores was because like you, I felt it<br/>\nwas their responsbility to help out as a member of our family. Those<br/>\nold-fashioned values and all that. Believe it or not, I also felt like I was<br/>\ndoing them a favor by helping them learn how to &quot;clean&quot;, so they could<br/>\nfunction on their own as an adult and not live in filth. I had my boys doing<br/>\nalmost EVERYTHING. Dishes, dusting, general picking up, cleaning toilets<br/>\n(FULL cleaning!), wiping bathroom sinks/counters, vacuuming, washing<br/>\nwindows, sweeping, etc. However, even with all my good intentions, my plans<br/>\nalways backfired on me. Chores always brought on feelings of resentment<br/>\nbetween me and my kids, very similar feelings, btw, of our homeschooling<br/>\nattempts and the frustrations that arose from that.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you know what my 10yo son actually said to me while it was his turn to do<br/>\ndishes one night? He said &quot;I can&#39;t wait until I get married so I can make my<br/>\nwife do the dishes and I won&#39;t ever have to do them again!&quot; I was shocked<br/>\nand appalled that he would say that! I felt something was going drastically<br/>\nwrong with my plan and teaching my boys responsibility regarding chores.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis all changed shortly after we started unschooling. I soon learned about<br/>\nthe unschooling lifestyle that extended beyond not doing schoolwork. I<br/>\ndecided to just drop chores, just like I dropped schoolwork. How did the<br/>\nwork get done, you might ask? Well, *I* did most of it. I just started doing<br/>\nthe work when I noticed it needed to be done. I let go of my expectations of<br/>\na clean house *all the time*. Many times, when I would get in a cleaning<br/>\nmood and put on some music to clean to, my boys would also just start<br/>\ncleaning with me, without me asking them! I&#39;ll be honest, this didn&#39;t happen<br/>\nright away, but I was patient and I gave it time, just like I did<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is still the way our house is now. There are no assigned chores or<br/>\njobs. I&#39;ll admit I do most of the work, but I *AM* the mother here. And it<br/>\nis not like I feel overwhelmed with cleaning, at this point. Of course, my<br/>\nDH does help me whenever possible as time permits. He does his share, too.<br/>\nBut I&#39;m home much more than he his. My boys are still doing spontaneous<br/>\ncleaning. They keep their rooms relatively clean most of the time. But, as<br/>\nthe mood hits them, they do other work, too. Last week my son actually<br/>\ncleaned his entire bathroom, even the toilet, without me asking!! I also ask<br/>\nthem to help me with specific cleaning if there is a need, and they usually<br/>\noblige with no complaints. We are unschooling chores - it&#39;s working for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing, we never call them chores.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bridget E Coffman","from":"Bridget E Coffman &lt;rumpleteasermom@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"j5KpOTA4sGDn_k7T7dxVs5mYttocEAQQCpcXB7fjdJfWbHyOWzyUQMHHMgwLWec7IrfYOU7RaApFToYzY05umbCGceVa3ghSWN9E0dOJl2Hx5hw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:Chores","postDate":"1000256530","msgId":25335,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwOTExLjIxMDMzMi4tNzg4MTQxLjMucnVtcGxldGVhc2VybW9tQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25332,"nextInTopic":36690,"prevInTime":25334,"nextInTime":25336,"topicId":2312,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, to be honest there is no penalty for missing a chore or two.
