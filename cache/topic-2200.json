Perhaps<br/>\nthere is a child somewhere who fits your cartoon.  However, I&#39;ve never met<br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t attempt to &quot;do school&quot; at home.  We don&#39;t rise at 6:00 every<br/>\nmorning, sit at a desk, eat lunch at 11:23 or raise our hands to use the<br/>\nbathroom.  Does that mean my children have had no childhood? I think not!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 7 year old would not know what recess was because he has never had one!<br/>\nIf you asked him about recess you would probably just get a blank look.  If<br/>\nyou asked him does he play every day, does he swing, climb, ride his bike,<br/>\nplay baseball, go swimming, go bowling - well then he could answer you!<br/>\nAnd he has friends,  but they are not all 7 years old.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike many teenagers, my 18 year old feels just as comfortable around<br/>\nadults as teens. He has been working along side adults for years.  Does that<br/>\nmean he has missed out on being a teenager?  Hmm - he drives to fast, stays<br/>\nout to late, always has a phone in his hand (sometimes 2 at once) and thinks<br/>\nhis parents don&#39;t know anything.  Isn&#39;t that a typical teenager?  He also<br/>\nhas a paper route, a fulltime job and plays tuba in the high school band (we<br/>\nlive in a very enlightened school district).  He has lots of friends, some<br/>\nare kids and some are adults. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s missing out on much.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children aren&#39;t sheltered from the world by being homeschooled - they are<br/>\nliving and learning in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else have a comment?<br/>\n<br/>\nBecky in Ohio</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2220,"nextTopicId":2224}}
