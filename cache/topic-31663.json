He said test results were expected Monday.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dalai Lama, 66, had undergone a medical checkup at the same hospital in <br/>\nearly December. &quot;He was found to be completely normal then,&quot; Mhatre said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dalai Lama was earlier flown to Bombay in a private airplane from <br/>\nPatna, the capital of the eastern state of Bihar, with two federal <br/>\ngovernment officials, his close aides and doctors.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was taken to Patna in a government helicopter from the religious hub of <br/>\nGaya, where health problems forced him to cancel his engagements at the <br/>\nmost sacred worship ceremony of Tibetan Buddhists.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader had been complaining of abdominal pain and <br/>\nexhaustion and was examined by a team of doctors in a Buddhist monastery in <br/>\nBodhgaya, where he had been staying since last week, said Masood Butt, his <br/>\npress coordinator. It then was decided he would fly to Bombay.<br/>\n<br/>\nA member of the medical team, A.M. Rai, said the Dalai Lama had a lump in <br/>\nhis stomach, but gave no further details.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, the Dalai Lama postponed his teachings before tens of <br/>\nthousands of followers at a special service. He said he would not be able <br/>\nto finish the rituals, which require him to sit still for at least five hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 with thousands of supporters after a <br/>\nfailed uprising against China. Since then, he has headed a <br/>\ngovernment-in-exile in the northern Indian town of Dharmsala. He was <br/>\nawarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his nonviolent struggle against <br/>\nChinese rule.<br/>\n<br/>\n© 2002 The Associated Press<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nCindy Ferguson<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31744,"nextTopicId":31752}}
