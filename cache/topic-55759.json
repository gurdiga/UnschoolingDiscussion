There are churches where the sermon is designed to make you think,<br/>\nto challenge you to see God in a different way.  There are churches that<br/>\nworship in three completely different ways on Sundays, but still are held<br/>\ntogether by a common foundation of faith.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t agree with everyone who worships at my church.  I have been a part<br/>\nof 9 churches in my 10 years of marriage (military...we move a lot!).  While<br/>\nmy beliefs aren&#39;t a perfect match for perhaps any church, I&#39;ve had clergy<br/>\nwho encourage me to read, study, think, pray, and consider why I believe<br/>\nwhat I do believe, so I can grow personally.  Much like I do as an<br/>\nunschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what you miss when you don&#39;t go to church: community.  I regularly<br/>\nhear from people on this list that they&#39;re so glad to find this group,<br/>\nbecause they don&#39;t know any other unschoolers.  So I know that community is<br/>\nimportant to us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCommunity isn&#39;t necessary, plenty of folks believe and are comfortable being<br/>\nalone in their faith.  But community does provide you with much support.<br/>\nDon&#39;t give up on churches entirely because you haven&#39;t found one that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t ask you to check your brain at the door.  They&#39;re out there.<br/>\nReally.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda<br/>\nEpiscopalian and proud of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1/21/03 04:37:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I never liked the group<br/>\n&gt; thinking mentality of church, or any other corporate entity for that<br/>\n&gt; matter. I get so tired of hearing &quot;we believe&quot; and &quot;we think&quot; that I just<br/>\n&gt; want to scream &quot;NO! WHAT DO *YOU* BELIEVE! WHAT DO *YOU* THINK!&quot; Anytime<br/>\n&gt; an entire group of people *think* the same thing, there is no thinking at<br/>\n&gt; all, imo. I have come to the belief that a vast majority of people like<br/>\n&gt; to be indoctrinated. It releases them of all responsibility and reason.<br/>\n&gt; If everyone at a church believed God could only be worshipped in one way,<br/>\n&gt; I would doubt the motives of the church.  If everyone on a list thought<br/>\n&gt; that there was only one way of unschooling, I would seriously have doubts<br/>\n&gt; about the integrity of the list. Even though we sometimes disagree, I<br/>\n&gt; value the free-thinking-ness of this list. Unfortunately, I have yet to<br/>\n&gt; find a church<br/>\n&gt; that offers the same. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56123,"nextTopicId":56065}}
