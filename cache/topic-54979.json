Besides which, it isn&#39;t like he&#39;s starving or clothed in <br/>\nrags. I&#39;m taking care of things AND really focusing on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older girl has moved forward in her High School correspondence <br/>\ncourses, answered emails, and read. The two littles have palled <br/>\naround. Lots of movies, lots of computer games, cleaned their rooms <br/>\nand moved furniture around, played outside. They have played chess <br/>\nand dominoes inside, and the card game War. Robby also made some kind <br/>\nof mess in the kitchen sink with flour and water, thinking he would <br/>\nbe making bread dough. L Oh, Robby helped make bread, and Katie put <br/>\nthe dessert together for one meal. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause my mornings haven&#39;t been spent forcing them to get back to <br/>\nwork, I haven&#39;t been wiped out on kids by noon, and have actually <br/>\nspent MORE time doing stuff with them.

Hubby and I talked last night. He&#39;s been mellower, too, this <br/>\nfrontal-lobe-syndrome, rigid, can&#39;t handle doing things differently <br/>\n(he used to grumble about the kids putting ranch dressing on their <br/>\nbroccoli or baked potatoes...&quot;That&#39;s for salads!&quot; LOL)...he was flat <br/>\ngrumpy for a day or so, and when I didn&#39;t make the kids sit down to <br/>\ntheir studies, and just gave the okay for whatever, well, yesterday <br/>\nHE was the one helping Robby finish cleaning up his room (cleaning <br/>\nthe rooms has taken two or three sessions so far.
