Whenever anything goes wrong, we pool our<br/>\ncurriculum specialists together to design a course to prevent the deviation<br/>\nfrom ever occurring again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve become aware of the increased interest in workplace &quot;anger management&quot;<br/>\ncourses in the wake of this week&#39;s two workplace shooting rampages.  This<br/>\nshould be a good money-making opportunity for professional trainers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just one example of how we as a culture confront intractable<br/>\nproblems.  We apply &quot;first aid&quot; and equip the best &quot;ambulances&quot; money or our<br/>\npolitical will can buy.  Somehow we seem incapable of putting our finger on<br/>\nand discussing the deeper, often systemic sources of these problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/joandersen\">http://members.xoom.com/joandersen</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4230,"nextTopicId":4240}}
