I was thinking maybe I could get him to work/Vol. <br/>\nat a computer place near here where we live.<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Marie --<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry it&#39;s taken me so long to get back to you.  Kinda hairy around <br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually I didn&#39;t get him into anything.  He did it himself.  I came <br/>\nhome from errands one day, and he informed me that he&#39;d been calling <br/>\naround to used computer stores, looking for old components that <br/>\nthey&#39;d be willing to let him have to mess around with.  He had a list <br/>\nof three places in the area to go to, and when we visited he let them <br/>\nknow that he&#39;d be willing to work around their places for no pay -- <br/>\njust for the opportunity to look over shoulders and learn a thing or <br/>\ntwo.  The last place took him up on it.  I was absolutely floored at <br/>\nhis maturity and presence.  He&#39;d just come out of the first part of <br/>\nhis deschooling phase and took me completely by surprise.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe worked at that store for four months until it went under, then got <br/>\na letter of reference from the owner, which he used to find himself <br/>\nanother job -- this time with a larger company that builds new <br/>\nsystems and operates largely online.  He helps them to assemble <br/>\nsystems and install software, and has begun working at the front desk <br/>\nhelping cutomers to customize their own systems.  It&#39;s pretty <br/>\nawesome.  As a bonus, he&#39;s working with a Chinese immigrant who <br/>\nspeaks very little English and who is teaching him some beginning <br/>\nChinese -- a language that has fascinated him for a long time.  It&#39;s <br/>\namazing to me what happens when we just let these kids go after <br/>\nthey&#39;ve been imprisoned by the system for so long.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend perhaps that you let him read this message, and <br/>\nshow him the phone book.  Let him know you&#39;ll drive him wherever he <br/>\nwants to go, when he&#39;s ready, that you&#39;ll go in with him if he wants <br/>\nor will sit in the car on your hands and biting your tongue if that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat he prefers.  If he hasn&#39;t already, have him read over the <br/>\nsections of the Teenage Liberation Handbook that deal with mentoring, <br/>\napprenticeship and volunteering.  Those were quite inspirational to <br/>\nmy ds.  Remember, there&#39;s no money in this.  It&#39;s for experience.  <br/>\nAnd part of the experience is going after the apprenticeship.  It&#39;s <br/>\namazing how many people, who are in love with what they do, really <br/>\ntake to the idea of sharing that love with an eager and industrious <br/>\nyoung person.  It makes everyone feel good.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nLaura B.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122146524,"authorName":"Marie A. in NY","from":"&quot;Marie A. in NY&quot; &lt;angelwings14513@...&gt;","profile":"angelwings14513","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 3086 &quot; Hello Laura&quot;","postDate":"1046524174","msgId":59909,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMzAxMTMwOTM0LjcyMjA0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwNjAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNDY1MDYzNzEuMzExNS44OTgxOC5tNUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":60112,"prevInTime":59908,"nextInTime":59910,"topicId":59909,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, Laura, How do did you get your son in to a floating apprentice for a computer company, building systems, loading software, and working at the front","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1902655197\">Hello, <br/>\nLaura, <br/>\nHow do did you get your son in to a <br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;floating <br/>\napprentice for a computer company, building systems, loading software, <br/>\nand <br/>\nworking at the front desk with customers&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is 14 and big into computers.
