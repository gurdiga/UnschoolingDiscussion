There are<br/>\nhowever, many different kinds of Christian churches out there. Some<br/>\nchurches keep their attendance high through fear and they tell you every<br/>\nweek about all the things there are out there to fear. (There might be a<br/>\nwitch living right next to you!)  Some churches also say that children<br/>\nare sinful by nature and would naturally choose what is bad for them if<br/>\ntheir parents didn&#39;t keep them on the right path, so they parent through<br/>\nfear.  Sometimes, I don&#39;t even think they realize what they are doing.<br/>\nIf you are parenting from a fear perspective, then you can&#39;t trust your<br/>\nchildren to educate themselves or to make moral choices because you are<br/>\ntoo afraid they will make the wrong choices. ( and that might reflect on<br/>\nyou.)<br/>\n <br/>\nUnschooling, imo, takes a great deal of trust in the nature of humans.<br/>\nWe are naturally curious unless we have spent years being forced to<br/>\nlearn about things that don&#39;t interest us while having our interests<br/>\nbrushed aside and our questions left unanswered.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf more people would get on with the business of living their lives and<br/>\ntheir morals, their children would naturally pick up on it and do the<br/>\nsame thing.  Just as we don&#39;t need to sit and teach them language arts,<br/>\nwe also don&#39;t need to sit them down for a lesson in morals.  Just live<br/>\nyour life, talk with your children about why you make certain decisions,<br/>\nlet them see you live your morals and they will learn them.  If you<br/>\ndon&#39;t live what you teach them, they will learn to be a hypocrite, just<br/>\nlike you.
