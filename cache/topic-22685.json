Also, many times I will write<br/>\nsomeone<br/>\n&gt; privately and make the sale that way. They often have more than one of the<br/>\n&gt; same product and will sometimes sell for cheaper because I save them the<br/>\n&gt; hassle of putting the item up for bid (and the cost, albeit minimal).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So if you know exactly what product you are looking for, check out the<br/>\n&gt; person&#39;s selling history, other items up for bid, rating, etc. This tells<br/>\nme<br/>\n&gt; a lot about what kind of seller the person is. And also keep in mind a<br/>\ngood<br/>\n&gt; ebayer will be as leery of you (first time buyer) as you are of them. They<br/>\n&gt; have a lot to lose too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve never had a bad ebay experience. I did buy something once that wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; exactly what I expected (a toy - the picture made it look *much* larger<br/>\nthan<br/>\n&gt; it was but clearly stated the size) but I am still extremely happy with it<br/>\n&gt; and that was *my* error.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When we bought our digital camera, we also negotiated (behind the scenes,<br/>\n&gt; after we won the auction) for extras at a lower price.

Ha!<br/>\nThat<br/>\n&gt; usually gets me some strange looks...<br/>\n&gt; I remember precisely when I decided I would homeschool.  My oldest son<br/>\n(now8)<br/>\n&gt; was 2 at the time.  He was running down the hill to the barn laughing and<br/>\n&gt; laughing.  It suddenly hit me that he would be going to school in 3 short<br/>\n&gt; years possibly earlier!  My heart just collapsed and I couldn&#39;t even think<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; the possibility of him going away for the whole day.  I would miss him<br/>\n&gt; terribly, he would miss me, and there is always something interesting to<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; on a farm.  He would miss so much life!  That did it, I started<br/>\nresearching<br/>\n&gt; right then.  I read and read and read ect....  I read John Holt, old<br/>\nGrowing<br/>\n&gt; Without Schooling Magazines, Old Home Education Magazines, and every book<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; saw mentioned in the back of other books.  I specifically drawn to John<br/>\nHolt<br/>\n&gt; and Grace Llewellyn.  I learned from everything I read though.  It made me<br/>\n&gt; see how diverse homeschooling can be.<br/>\n&gt; I also researched the laws for my state during this time.<br/>\n&gt; I also looked into support groups, and made contact with a local one.  It<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; interesting to talk to everyone but my sons (we had added one during this<br/>\n&gt; time) were much too young to do much.  I then renewed contact later when<br/>\nall<br/>\n&gt; three of my kids were older.<br/>\n&gt; I still read and read....  I still talk and talk....  It helps to share.<br/>\n&gt; I hope this helps you...and enjoy your family.  That is what we do mostly.<br/>\n&gt; Ann<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 8<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 21 Jun 2001 23:49:54 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:diamondair@...\">diamondair@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Encouragement please....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Brandon Frantz&quot; &lt;frantzx4@e...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was wondering what your favorite source for encouragement is<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For me, part of my encouragement just comes from watching my kids and<br/>\n&gt; how they learn.

When I see this, I know that if we just apply<br/>\n&gt; the same encouraging, yet hands-off principle to all other learning,<br/>\n&gt; our kids will do just fine at whatever they put their ambition to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And for external motivation, you can&#39;t beat a good John Holt book, he<br/>\n&gt; wrote a dozen or so and they&#39;re all great.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Blue Skies!<br/>\n&gt;    -Robin-<br/>\n&gt; Mom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;If our dog dies, we can recycle him as a<br/>\n&gt; rug&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and Asa (10/5/99) &quot;Hand me grandpa!&quot; (when I was on the phone to my<br/>\n&gt; dad)<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 9<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 21 Jun 2001 17:39:49 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Reporter said, &quot;If the children had been in school where they<br/>\nbelonged . . .&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Has anyone else been watching the news on the Yates family?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/06/21/children.killed/index.html\">http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/06/21/children.killed/index.html</a>  As we were<br/>\n&gt; running through the stations, two reporters quizzed the father on the fact<br/>\n&gt; that they homeschooled the children and asked various questions about<br/>\n&gt; curriculum and unit studies.

We<br/>\n&gt; unschool in the sense of trusting that our children<br/>\n&gt; will know when they are ready to take on tasks and<br/>\n&gt; following their lead for what they want to learn and<br/>\n&gt; how they want to learn it.  My daughter is nine this<br/>\n&gt; month and took off on reading about 6 months ago.  She<br/>\n&gt; spends a fair amount of time reading both fiction and<br/>\n&gt; non-fiction, but also still loves to spend time with<br/>\n&gt; her various critters and engage in make-believe play<br/>\n&gt; with her sibling and other children.  She loves to<br/>\n&gt; draw, but she HATESs to write.  If she wants to leave<br/>\n&gt; herself a note, for example, to bring her tortoise in<br/>\n&gt; for the night instead of writing out the words she<br/>\n&gt; will draw a picture of the tortoise grazing and post<br/>\n&gt; that where it reminds her.  I have been fine with this<br/>\n&gt; approach and have trusted that when she is at a point<br/>\n&gt; in her life where she wants to truly express her<br/>\n&gt; feelings she will feel compelled to write.  I have<br/>\n&gt; kind of expected this will happen in adolescence.<br/>\n&gt; Recently an event happened that is causing me to<br/>\n&gt; question my judgement.  Has anyone else out there left<br/>\n&gt; it up to divine providence that their children will<br/>\n&gt; indeed want to, and then proceed to, learn to write<br/>\n&gt; when they are ready?   Has anyone any regrets about<br/>\n&gt; not being more proactive with their child in teaching<br/>\n&gt; writing?

When I first<br/>\nstarted<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling, I was not an unschooler and had never even heard about it.<br/>\n&gt; But I disliked the other kind of homeschooling because it was always<br/>\ncoercive<br/>\n&gt; learning and the thing is, what do you do if you tell the kids to do a<br/>\nmath<br/>\n&gt; paper or write something and an hour later they&#39;re still sitting there<br/>\n&gt; thinking about other things?  Some of my kids were this way.  So then you<br/>\nget<br/>\n&gt; into the &quot;discipline&quot; issues, meaning threats or blackmails, and it just<br/>\nall<br/>\n&gt; felt wrong to me.<br/>\n&gt;      When I found out about unschooling, it really appealed to me and we<br/>\n&gt; gradually moved more and more in that direction.  At first I was afraid<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t learn anything (a common concern) but I found that they learn<br/>\nmore<br/>\n&gt; their way than they ever did before.  They read a lot and each have their<br/>\nown<br/>\n&gt; unique interests.<br/>\n&gt;      I have five boys, ages 4, 9, 13, 13, and 17.  My 9 year old has some<br/>\n&gt; learning difficulties and at times I have worried that he might need more<br/>\n&gt; structured learning but he seems to be making some huge jumps lately.  My<br/>\n17<br/>\n&gt; year old just passed the California High School Proficiency test so he has<br/>\n&gt; the legal equivalent of a diploma now.  The kids value their freedom and<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t like me to schedule too many activities for them because they like<br/>\n&gt; having a lot of time.<br/>\n&gt;     I have no regrets whatsoever and only wish that I had known to<br/>\nunschool a<br/>\n&gt; long time ago.  It would have saved my oldest son from some lousy<br/>\nexperiences<br/>\n&gt; with his kindergarten and second grade teachers.  He was always a<br/>\ndaydreamer<br/>\n&gt; and has become a very thoughtful and creative person but that wasn&#39;t<br/>\nvalued<br/>\n&gt; in school.<br/>\n&gt;      Your situation sounds incredibly interesting and I hope that you will<br/>\n&gt; post more about what you do there.  Best wishes with all that you decide<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; do...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;        Lucy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 12<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 21 Jun 2001 22:40:05 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;    From: kate mcdaniel &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:K8MCD@...\">K8MCD@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: writing and unschoolin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tammy,<br/>\n&gt;   I am definetly not an expert in this area - but here is my 2 cents.<br/>\n&gt;   My oldest wrote at an early age - part of that was from attending ps for<br/>\n2<br/>\n&gt; years.  However her penmanship is horrible.  My 2nd child - my son, I<br/>\nwaited<br/>\n&gt; till he was about 7 to attempt writing.  We did the &quot;Teach Your Child to<br/>\n&gt; Read in 100 Easy Lessons&quot; - it worked for him.  His penmanship is nice and<br/>\n&gt; neat.  We also used the &quot;A Reason for Writing&quot; lessons.<br/>\n&gt; My 3rd child is a lefty - I tried &quot;Teach Your Child&quot; method with her, we<br/>\n&gt; both would end up frustrated.  I decided to allow her to do as she<br/>\nwanted -<br/>\n&gt; no lines, no forced writing.  She is not writing fluently, well she can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; even write her name - but she is interested in learning because it is what<br/>\n&gt; she wants to do, not what I am forcing her to do.  I will write something<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; a piece of paper and she will copy it on another piece.<br/>\n&gt; You might try asking your daughter if she would like to put some of her<br/>\n&gt; &quot;make-believe&quot; stories in a book, and let her illustrate it also.

Right now her<br/>\n&gt; writing skills are pretty basic, her spacing, capitilization (sp), etc are<br/>\n&gt; very rough. I dont mind, she knows more on other things than kids twice<br/>\nher<br/>\n&gt; age so....... Things like this used to worry me, but now, that I have seen<br/>\n&gt; her learning life&#39;s skills all by herself and with some inquistive<br/>\n&gt; questions, I am prretty much comfy with the fact that she will learn what<br/>\n&gt; she needs to, when she needs to!<br/>\n&gt; Indiana Tami-no sleep for over 24 hrs. so very rambling :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Tamara Rousso &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tammy@...\">tammy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] writing and unschoolin<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 21 Jun 2001 21:14:26 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hi,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am new to this list and subscribed because I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt;interested in the opinions of other unschooling moms<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and how your children have learned writing skills.
