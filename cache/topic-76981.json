It is either transparent, traslucent, or opaque. It occasionally containes small amounts of opal.<br/>\n <br/>\nSome of the many types of chalcedony include agate, bloodstoe, chysoprase, carnelian, chert, flint, jasper, onyx, sardonyx, touchstone, and petrified wood.<br/>\n <br/>\nChysoprase is concidered to be &#39;best quality&#39; chalcedony<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;The best quality material is a rich &#39;apple&#39; green, homogeneous, translucent, chalcedony which is used as a simulant for rare and highly prized Imperial Green Jadite.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nIt is often called and sold as &#39;Australian Jade&#39;<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ll ask Jason when he gets home what books he would recomend, as far as the silver casting goes.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe have both been doing a lot of wire wrapping lately and Jason used to work in metals a lot when he was doing iron work and had acess to the equipment.
