Unable to control his<br/>\nmischievous bent, Satan is here portrayed opening the library window and<br/>\nscattering various holy books among the people of the earth to see what bedlam he<br/>\ncan cause.  Out of the clouds of heaven thus comes the rain of confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nImage 2  The Tower of Biblio:  Provided new insight by God Himself, the peoples of<br/>\nthe earth recognize their confusion and decide to unite together to build a Tower<br/>\nof Biblio.  The Tower is planned to reach into the highest reaches of God&#39;s<br/>\nlibrary where they can together access the single exalted Book of Love, the<br/>\nhighest Law, written in a language that all can understand.  But, as the picture<br/>\ndepicts, even as the Tower is being built, the devil&#39;s librarians on earth, the<br/>\nkeepers of the holy books, are tearing out the foundations so that the Tower will<br/>\ncrumble.  Once the Tower falls, the librarians will spread the tale that it is God<br/>\nHimself who has sown such great confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nImage 3  The Annunciation:  But then the Great Lord, seeing what had been done in<br/>\nhis Name, spoke:  �What need you towers or knowledge of my books, O my people?<br/>\nFor I have implanted my law, the Law of Love, in each of your hearts, in each, so<br/>\nthat each of you shall know Me, and find Me, every one of you, even the children<br/>\namong you, each in your own way.� And Satan and his priests trembled, for the<br/>\npeople praised the Lord, each in her own language and every one in his own song,<br/>\nin a harmony of many voices together that had never before been heard on earth or<br/>\nin the heavens.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid H.

It did not say<br/>\n&gt; anything about a specific religion, it was about taking away the right to<br/>\n&gt; believe in whatever God or Gods we choose. I am not a religious person,<br/>\n&gt; but I am spiritual, I believe in many things from many religions, and I<br/>\n&gt; still think it wrong to take away a persons right to pray. I took my<br/>\n&gt; children out of public school because they valued money and<br/>\n&gt; accomplishment more than the person and I do not want my children to feel<br/>\n&gt; that material things are more valueable than human beings. I don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt; anyone who knew me could say I was a religious fanatic or only embraced<br/>\n&gt; one way of belief, my oldest daughter practices Wicca, my youngest<br/>\n&gt; daughter is a Luteren, my mother in law is a Catholic and my mother is a<br/>\n&gt; reincarnationist, I believe that every faith and belief has an element of<br/>\n&gt; truth in it or there would not be so many people who believed. However I<br/>\n&gt; agree with the basic principal this is trying to get across, if you take<br/>\n&gt; the parents and faith away how can you offer a child a balanced<br/>\n&gt; upbringing, instead of seeing one thing that you disagree with and making<br/>\n&gt; an issue try to see the entire overview, I have reread it and still do<br/>\n&gt; not see anywhere that is says anything about Xtian beliefs or morals, am<br/>\n&gt; I missing something? And I personally have a big problem with child<br/>\n&gt; pornography and would hope that every parent would. Personally I also<br/>\n&gt; think thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbor<br/>\n&gt; as yourself., is a pretty good moral foundation for any religion and if<br/>\n&gt; you look probably appears in one form or another in any religion you can<br/>\n&gt; name.

Oh, sorry, I just did :-)  I don&#39;t think this is a great idea at all.

I&#39;m not sure whether the Bible should be in schools or not, but if it is then all other major religious works should be too.  I&#39;m not sure whether porn should be on the internet or not, and since on the few occasions I&#39;ve landed on such sites, there have been big signs saying &#39;over 18&#39;s only,&#39; etc all over them, I think it&#39;s about as dangerous as the top-shelf magazines and those aren&#39;t banned, so whaddya do?  Child pornography is a whole other ballgame, of course.  Dr Spock was reportedly outraged at being branded permissive, and according to Deborah Jackson in Three in a Bed, there is little in Dr Spock&#39;s babycare manual that could be seen as such.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is serious bigotry going on here, and I&#39;ve seen folks thrown off other lists for less.  The original post does mention the Bible, and that alone (apart from the rest) gives it a Christian bias.  Keith&#39;s God is not mine, nor many others, and that has been shown.  Institutionalised school is exactly that, intitutionalising the children it processes into whatever culture is in control of the school.  The whole thing has an Ezzo-ish reek to me, the bit about teachers not disciplining children, users of the English language should be ashamed of the use of discipline in this way, I thought a disciple was a follower, in Christian terms, one of the select followers of Jesus, so did Jesus &#39;discipline&#39; them?  No, if you believe the teachings (I don&#39;t believe that he is any more a part of the force of the world known as God than any other human, but I think he existed and taught, and was a charismatic and strong spiritual leader, that&#39;s my slant on it :-) ) he led by example, both in his actions and his words.  I can&#39;t think of a better way of disciplining anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nYa know what, the best idea is if people think about what they&#39;re saying before they post these rants, even if they didn&#39;t write them.  And those who have strong views on any subject can learn to present those views without assuming that everyone else holds those views, or should hold those views.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJMN-S-HO!!!<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Brynn <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, February 14, 2000 5:36 PM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Great Idea<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: &quot;Brynn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:panchot@...\">panchot@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think classifying child pornography in with no bible at school is ridiculous and narrow minded.

What<br/>\nabout those who are atheists or agnostics? I also think it is important to<br/>\nappreciate our cultural and religious differences how many schools teach<br/>\nthat appreciation?Those schools that do that I know of a few rare inner city<br/>\nschools. Still Unschooling is about learning to respect our children&#39;s<br/>\ndifferences and not coercing them. Some schools may try but most are not<br/>\nallowed for fear of insulting someone. Up here they do only Christian and<br/>\nonce in a rare while a Jewish thing but no other religions or world cultures<br/>\nare appreciated. The whole thing about ps schools in America historically it<br/>\nwas founded by the Christians who wanted to indoctronate people like the<br/>\nNative Americans into their way of thinking. So now of course the moral<br/>\nmajority can yell and all about it but there really is no way to honor<br/>\neveryone&#39;s traditions without learning how to be open minded and not<br/>\noffended by those differences. Who is teaching that value? That is why I am<br/>\nso alone up here and looking for support.
