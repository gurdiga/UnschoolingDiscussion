It <br/>\n  takes different &quot;things&quot; and just explains how they work.  Really cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But then we ran across a REALLY good documentary on the Discovery Channel <br/>\n  about cavemen, narrated by Alec Baldwin.  It was so cool because he started at <br/>\n  the species furthest from us and proceeded up the line, showing each skull, the <br/>\n  differences from ours and from the species before it and after it (in the <br/>\n  scheme of evolution) then there&#39;d be a reinactment of what scientists believe each <br/>\n  group looked like, acted, what they ate, relationships, etc.  Only bad thing <br/>\n  about the whole show was the commercials!  LOL!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Long story short, it got me to thinking I&#39;d like to know of any favorite, <br/>\n  quality, &quot;educational&quot; (or not) channels and especially shows your families enjoy <br/>\n  and really get something out of.  I believed for a long time that a TV was <br/>\n  almost an enemy of homeschoolers, but for the last year have realized how many <br/>\n  possibilities it has!!  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
