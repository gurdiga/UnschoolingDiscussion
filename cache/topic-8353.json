(You would do this with the<br/>\nchild laying down.)  They get more of it in this way, and it&#39;s far more<br/>\ncomfortable for them, and less scary.  The drops feel better going into the eye<br/>\nthat way (on the whites) than they do on the iris or pupil (the white has no<br/>\nfeeling), and the blinking naturally spreads the drops around inside.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLynne</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"libbygirl","from":"&quot;libbygirl&quot; &lt;libbygirl@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"JZiv0moRWdd0_PQjzKokTU8TBIMEo-vVfSke7sgVL9tleutd4jj59EQp3Vjb44CFQMcvUZLUFxeFclv-HazST-st9I9GbVbWtQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Att Mook&#39;s Mom","postDate":"956954008","msgId":8353,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNzkwMWJmYjE1MSQwMzcxN2RlMCQzMzdlMzdkMkBsaWJieWdpcmw+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8355,"prevInTime":8352,"nextInTime":8354,"topicId":8353,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My godson sounds exactly like your little one!
