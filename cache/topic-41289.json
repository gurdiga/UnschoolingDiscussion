If you&#39;d like one, please email<br/>\nme privately and we can talk about it. I&#39;ve already been suspected of trying<br/>\nto &quot;sell something&quot; to this group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote yesterday that I have made several hour-long TV programs, called,<br/>\n&quot;School is Hell,&quot; that I play (sponsor -- it means that I take<br/>\nresponsibility for their content) on the local cable-access channels in area<br/>\ntowns. Luz and I sometimes make copies to send to homeschoolers (and others)<br/>\nin other areas where they sponsor them on their local channels. It has been<br/>\na hobby. For example, when Linda Dobson comes to CT, we tape her talk and<br/>\nmake it into a program and play it on public access. She is glad to give us<br/>\npermission. Same for John Gatto, Sam Blumenfeld, Pat Farenga, and others --<br/>\nfriends.<br/>\n<br/>\nCall it a &quot;Labor of UN-love&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;d like a tape, let me say first that they are not in any way made in<br/>\norder to help families homeschool/unschool their children. They are personal<br/>\nrants/ diatribes -- just me talking, with an edge of displeasure -- about<br/>\nthe failings of the public school system.  I do not make these programs for<br/>\ntheir general entertainment value.  My purpose is to tell parents the goals<br/>\nof those schools, the damage they do to the children, the parents, the<br/>\ncommunity, the culture, so they will at least consider taking the kids out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve made about 200 programs over the past 8 years and most of them are<br/>\nabout how rotten the public schools are.  As time passed, and I went to<br/>\nschool board meetings listening to them talk about their (terrible) programs<br/>\nand dishonest policies, imagining that those elected neighbors would take an<br/>\ninterest in changing things for the better. I found out that they are part<br/>\nof the problem, and they are not even trying to be the solution. In fact,<br/>\nthey promote all the bad stuff that the schools do. They are the rubber<br/>\nstamps for the school establishment and its employees. In CT, the local<br/>\nschool boards are agents of the state, not representatives of the town&#39;s<br/>\npeople. --- Yeah, it&#39;s that bad... They do the bidding of the state dept of<br/>\ned instead of working for local parents and children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this town, the local public access station televises all school board<br/>\nmeetings, so in my programs, I use tape (copied) from those meetings in<br/>\norder to show the residents just how corrupt the system is. The local<br/>\nschoolers have been up in arms about the programs (and me personally, of<br/>\ncourse) for years, but I have continued, and the programs have become more,<br/>\nshall we say, strident and confident until nowadays I simply call them<br/>\nSchool Is Hell, and play it as a series of thirteen programs running each<br/>\nweek (twice) as a TV series. At the end of the three month cycle, I run<br/>\nanother series.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMuch of my material comes from Gatto, Holt, Greenberg (Sudbury) and  the<br/>\nbooks  of about one hundred other people -- all critical of the PS system<br/>\nand therefore offering encouragement to take children out.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few titles are:<br/>\n<br/>\nWho Controls Our Children?<br/>\nSchool Corruption<br/>\nPublic School: War Against Children<br/>\n  This is the Title of a series of many programs<br/>\nReadin&#39; Writin&#39; and Ritalin<br/>\nDying For School<br/>\nIf Parents Ran the Schools... I & II<br/>\n    a list of questions about the bad policies that schools use<br/>\nThe High Price of Dumbing Down<br/>\nWhat Parents Need To Know<br/>\nPublic School Teach Dumbness<br/>\nParents Versus the State<br/>\nHow Schools Got Dumb<br/>\nWho, Exactly, is Teaching the Children?<br/>\nPhonics Is How Reading Happens<br/>\n   -etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n....you get the idea, Since the school system is seamless, every thread<br/>\n(topic) leads to the central problem that the system is a fraud.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll programs are one hour, suitable for play on public access, although<br/>\nthere might be some variations where you are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have, in this way, been what is called an &quot;activist.&quot; Sponsoring the tapes<br/>\nis my way of challenging the edu-stablishment.
