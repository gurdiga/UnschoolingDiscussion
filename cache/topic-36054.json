Danny has tremendous trouble<br/>\ncontrolling his emotional outbursts and so we spend a lot of time talking<br/>\nabout it.  There are places that I must go that I may choose to leave him<br/>\nhome with a babysitter because the circumstances pretty much guarantee a<br/>\nfit.  So I am working more with him in that area to help him be happy and in<br/>\ncontrol of himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdriane is not &quot;special needs&quot; but she is a terrible speller (she would be<br/>\nthe first one to tell you so).  So when she has 4-H reports or whatever, we<br/>\nspend a lot of time talking about spelling, I help her by telling her how to<br/>\nspell words.<br/>\n<br/>\nZach would be labeled &quot;special needs&quot; if he were in school (the dreaded<br/>\nADHD).  Again we spend time talking about what behaviors drive others<br/>\ninsane, possible alternatives.  I encourage him to get outside as much as<br/>\npossible and to get plenty of rest.  When he starts just flopping across the<br/>\nfloor about 11:00, I tell him to go to bed if he is tired.  He isn&#39;t forced<br/>\nbut encouraged.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarsie should have been special needs (her birth family is full to the gills<br/>\nwith retardation and psychosis) but she is probably the most energetic<br/>\nlearner we have.  It is all I can do to just keep up with her learning and<br/>\nto answer her many and varied questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle is not special needs but she is two, so I help her see the benefits<br/>\nof picking up toys, of not throwing food during dinner.  I answer all her<br/>\nquestions as they come.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor each of the kids, I work to meet them where they are.  That is<br/>\nunschooling, that is individualized parenting for special needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36067,"nextTopicId":36101}}
