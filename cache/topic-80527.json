The other posts I have read have been extraordinarily helpful. Our family experiences this rage at times. I have been insulted and hit. From my inexperienced position(I have never really seen it modeled in a way that I would like to do it and coming from a very violent childhood)I do not always respond appropriately. I am always trying to improve. I have analyzed this situation to try to find its roots. I have no answers but I agree with the need to set boundries. Insulting and blaming are all inefficient attempts that adults and children express anger, frustration, embarrassment and try to get needs met. There is a website called www.radicalhonesty.com that gives some examples of better ways to express anger. It is very radical and I don´t agree with everything there but it has been very helpful. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have no problem walking away when it is directed at me, the problems arise when it is between two siblings and they are getting close to hitting. For example. Yesterday two kids(age 11 and 7) were watching TV in the bedroom. THe 7 y/o decided somehow(I was not present) that her arms needed to take up all the space and she wouldn´t move for the 11y/o who then had no place to sit. While they were restling over the space I was trying to point out how frustrated I was because a child needed a place to sit and another felt her arms were more important. Their pushing got to the point that someone was going to get hurt after about 10 minutes so I just picked her up and took her out of the room explaining that she wasn´t being reasonable and wouldn´t even negotiate or offer alternatives(this is obviously not about arm space...who knows what was really going on for her and it is a shame that I may never because of my mishandling of the situation). That is when her rage set in. She started kicking doors and punching the microwave. I felt the need to stop her because I don´t have enough money to replace doors and microwaves so I threatened her(I realized even at the time that this was wrong but didn´t know what to do)with damaging one of her things if she damaged one of mine. (this is hard for me to share...deep breath). SHe ended up crying in her room for awhile and I ended up in regret. When a child is unreasonable and infringing on anothers´s rights how do you get them to stop? ALso, Nancy B.  wrote about working with foster children(a very helpful post btw) &quot;Or, if I was in the middle of something, they <br/>\nwould have to leave the room, go upstairs, go outside...think about <br/>\nthings...but remove themselves from my presence.  Same situation if they are harassing <br/>\nanother child or sibling.  It really worked for us. &quot; We do this too but the angry child refuses to go somewhere else, refuses to leave.... Sometimes I am cooking and others are hungry and I need to stay in the kitchen and the aggressor is in the kitchen. Or just yesterday the same 7 y/o came into the livingroom where the only VCR is, sat down and announced that she wanted quiet. I listed the places she could go to get quiet, I would even go with her, but one child wanted to watch a video and had no alternatives. She screamed and wailed about it for a long time, demanding space etc. It finally worked itself out that the child that wanted the video changed her mind and we left the room. But what if ....I can´t get her to be quiet or leave the room, She is unreasonable etc..Ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80388,"nextTopicId":19406}}
