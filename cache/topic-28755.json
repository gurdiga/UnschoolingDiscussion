If she wants that path,  SHE should be on it as the driver.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are SO many different ways of *being* a doctor.....a teaching one,   a<br/>\nresearch one,   a psychiatrist,  a rural doc.   Not to mention the whole<br/>\nhealth care system is changing greatly as we speak (write).  many doctors<br/>\nare driven by managed care insurance companies.  Many are not thrilled woth<br/>\nthis...they have less power to make their own decisions and it&#39;s nearly<br/>\nimpossible to survive unless you practice in a group.<br/>\nAnd with the &quot;Graying of America&quot; as well as other unpredictable<br/>\noccurrences,  who knows what the face of healthcare will look like even 3-5<br/>\nyears from now.<br/>\nSusan<br/>\nP.S.

Thank goodness he didn&#39;t believe in<br/>\nconventional ways!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you&#39;re still looking at the conventional road, though ...<br/>\nactually, if my daughter wanted to be a physician, I think the first<br/>\nthing I would do would be to arrange some sort of a job shadow or<br/>\ninternship so she could get some real-world knowledge of the job. When I<br/>\nwas 14, I used to file articles and papers for my dad (who is a<br/>\nphysician, and also in charge of his department&#39;s residency program at a<br/>\nlarge tecahing hospital) after school many afternoons for a couple of<br/>\nhours, and just being there was a real eye-opener, even though I&#39;d been<br/>\nhearing about this stuff all my life. Maybe you&#39;ve done this, I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow. I know my dad has spent hours talking to and emailing people who<br/>\nwere interested in becoming doctors, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the other thing that leaps out for me is that you&#39;re talking<br/>\nabout the research that *you* have done... what has your 15 year old done<br/>\nfor herself? I don&#39;t see myself doing that sort of stuff for my daughter<br/>\nin 7 years... if seems like learning how to find out things for herself<br/>\nwould be a helpful thing for her to know..</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28759,"nextTopicId":28749}}
