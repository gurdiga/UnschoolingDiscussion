That in his mind,<br/>\nit&#39;s not important to be better than the girls?  Is his size an issue, since<br/>\nthe other small person is also having trouble -- he can&#39;t change his size,<br/>\nbut can he change his stance, etc.?  If he is uncomfortable talking to the<br/>\ninstructor alone, maybe you can join him.  But the above statements gave me<br/>\nthe impression that with a fair chance, and some support, maybe he could<br/>\nmake it work.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, figure the $$ are gone at this point, and consider with your son<br/>\nwhether sticking with it and trying, but not stressing about passing is<br/>\nworthwhile, or if continuing would be an emotional loss as well as a<br/>\nfinancial loss.

How much of the course has he already taken?  Enough that it is worth it to reschedule the remainder for another time?  Is he the only hs kid there?  We found that the courses as they stand are weighted far more heavily to so-called &quot;safety&quot; than actual stroke improvement.  We found it best to gather up two or three kids of similar swimming ability and have &quot;private lessons&quot;  (They will schedule &quot;private&quot; for as little as three kids at fairly reasonable rates).  You can even try to schedule your own hs bronze in the fall -- I know that Susan Mallandaine is looking for someone for her private, and I think Sarah is 12-ish, and passed all the aquaquest levels.  I am in a similar situation, and made my kids finish out the course, and now they are adamantly refusing to register for any more.  In hindsight, I would have given up more than a hundred dollars to have not biased them against swimming.  We are going to take an &quot;unswimming&quot; approach in the fall, and just go to the pool a couple of times a week until they feel the need to improve their strokes in a more formal way.
