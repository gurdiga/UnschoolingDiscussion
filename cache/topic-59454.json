My kids very<br/>\n&gt; rarely get into that stuff. I keep thinking maybe it&#39;s because of me not<br/>\n&gt; being craft minded. They both love to draw a lot and even Tara still likes<br/>\n&gt; coloring and doing collage type stuff with pictures and all. But none of<br/>\n&gt; them do craft things alone. If I find something and present it, they&#39;ll do<br/>\n&gt; it then. That&#39;s why I force myself to do so, I feel like they are missing<br/>\n&gt; out because I&#39;m not naturally like that and they have never been exposed to<br/>\n&gt; that kind of thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You might ask them to decorate the house for the next holiday (our calendar<br/>\nindicates that&#39;s Easter, 2 months away &lt;g&gt; but the girls started decorating<br/>\ntonight).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis accomplishes a couple things: it&#39;s a fun project and the beauty of it<br/>\nis that as soon as Easter&#39;s over, they can start on the next one if they<br/>\nwant; it helps in the Personal Growth of people like us, Mary, who<br/>\neventually DO learn to control the facial tick that quickly develops when<br/>\nEVERYTHING is covered with taped-on paper easter eggs and paintings.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughters also make lots of pictures and craft things (for holidays or<br/>\npresents or just for fun) for friends and relatives, which I dutifully put<br/>\nin the mail or we all deliver depending on schedules and distance concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59453,"nextTopicId":59366}}
