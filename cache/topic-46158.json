Some of us just have<br/>\nto be readers or writers or artists.<br/>\nHas anyone else come to these conclusions?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have come to accept it.  I&#39;ve always know I&#39;m an introvert.  I love having a<br/>\nnice conversation with 1 or 2 people.  Get a whole group of people together<br/>\nand I start feeling tired really quickly.  This has led me to cut of ties with<br/>\npeople for months at a time just to get back to myself.  I find I like to<br/>\nactually listen to what people are saying and many people talking at once<br/>\nlimits my ability to focus on (and understand) one person.  I have a friend on<br/>\nthis list who thrives on lots of people being around.  I think that&#39;s cool<br/>\ntoo.  If everyone was an introvert there&#39;d be less progress.  If everyone was<br/>\nan extrovert there&#39;d be chaos.<br/>\n<br/>\nCherry in GA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46154,"nextTopicId":46139}}
