I&#39;m keyed up and ready for the next one now.<br/>\nOnly 4 months to go!<br/>\n<br/>\nMark downloaded a desktop from the LOTR site so now I have the coolest pic<br/>\nof Viggo on my screen. What a way to wake up!<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone read LOTR to their kids? We have just finished The Hobbit and the<br/>\nboys loved it but I think that LOTR will be too much for them. There is so<br/>\nmuch to the book, I don&#39;t want to spoil it by reading it too early.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Also, posting policies, a more detailed list description, and other list<br/>\ninformation, are provided at:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/lists/info\">http://sandradodd.com/lists/info</a>&gt;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
