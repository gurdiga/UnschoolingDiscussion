As a term, &quot;rights&quot; is an 18th<br/>\ncentury product of Western Englightenment thinking and a Neoclassical<br/>\ninterpretation/adoption of Greek city-state ideals. Rights and individual<br/>\nautonomy--&quot;all men are created equal&quot; and &quot;right to life, liberty and<br/>\npursuit of happiness&quot; kind of thing--are also products of this 18th century<br/>\nkind of thinking. The &quot;individual&quot; is a relatively new thing, historically<br/>\nspeaking. In my understanding, even in the Western world (I can&#39;t speak of<br/>\nother cultures) early religious and dynastic structures had little room for<br/>\nthe &quot;individual&quot; as s/he came to be described by philosophers like Rousseau<br/>\nand which we (in the US, anyway) hold to be &quot;self-evident&quot;. Yet, these<br/>\ntruths of individual autonomy are self-evident in very limited ways when we<br/>\nlook a little more closely. All men weren&#39;t, in fact, created equal. Slaves<br/>\ncould be seen as 3/4 of a person without the glaring self-contradiction that<br/>\nwe see now. Women and children were chattel. Enlightenment ideals exchanged<br/>\na &quot;might makes right&quot; for a &quot;wealth makes rights&quot; way of doing things.<br/>\n<br/>\nRights have become more universal throughout time, but not without major<br/>\ncivil rights battles. As Sandra pointed out, the Equal Rights Ammendment<br/>\nthat would have guaranteed women equal rights under the constitution failed<br/>\nto be adopted. Just recently, the American government actually considered<br/>\nammending the constitution to explicitly deny the right for gay people to<br/>\nmarry. Children are still considered chattel for the parents to raise as<br/>\nthey see fit, as Julie points out. Equal rights and universal autonomy is<br/>\nstill a myth--even in America.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I find the idea of children&#39;s rights interesting in the context<br/>\nof the US and other democracies that pretend to universal ideals of equal<br/>\nrights. I find the exclusions pretty interesting--at any given time, what<br/>\ngroup is it okay to exclude from the privilege of universal rights and why.<br/>\nSlaves, women, Japanese, children, homosexuals... Deb L&#39;s article in the<br/>\nrecent Life Learning magazine is particularly poignant in this context. Why<br/>\nis a person denied the right to vote one day, but deemed fully capable and<br/>\ngranted that right the next? What switch gets turned? Why 18 and not 12 or<br/>\n16 or 25?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs unschoolers, do we have a deeper sense of democracy and individual<br/>\nrights? Or, do we orchestrate benevolent dictatorships like Sandra<br/>\nmentioned?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, I would say our home functions as a social contract, and this gets<br/>\ninto the punishment question as well. Rights and autonomy are respected as<br/>\nlong as individuals are participating in the social contract that makes<br/>\nrights and autonomy a mutual thing. So, when there&#39;s a squabble between my<br/>\nthree (7, 5 and 4), we try to work it out, come up with a common preference,<br/>\nbut that depends upon everyone&#39;s willingness to listen and work things out.<br/>\nIf one of them flat out refuses to brainstorm ideas or stop hitting or<br/>\nwhatever, then that person breeches the social contract with anti-social<br/>\nbehavior and the responsibility falls on them to remove themselves from the<br/>\nsituation.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, if Emily and Julia both want the same Polly Pocket (that<br/>\nbelongs to both of them) and Emily is willing to brainstorm ways to share,<br/>\nalternate, whatever, but Julia refuses to budge, then Julia forfeits her<br/>\nright to the Polly Pocket at that moment. Or, if Sam and Emily are<br/>\nwrestling, but then Emily wants to stop and Sam keeps jumping on her anyway,<br/>\nhe gets removed from the room because he could not respect Emily&#39;s right to<br/>\nsay no. Sam doesn&#39;t get sent to his room or put in a time out; he just gets<br/>\ntold he needs to find somewhere else to be until he&#39;s ready to respect other<br/>\npeople. His options might be his room to play, the playroom, my bedroom to<br/>\nwatch a DVD, the kitchen to bake some bread with me--whatever. For me, the<br/>\npoint is that respect must be mutual. Just last night Sam followed me into<br/>\nmy room screaming at me because we were having sorbet and didn&#39;t have ice<br/>\ncream. He was exhausted. Didn&#39;t want a bite of my sorbet to see if he liked<br/>\nit; nothing was right, basically. So I picked him up and carried him to his<br/>\nroom, telling him that he couldn&#39;t scream at me in my room, that I had the<br/>\nright to be safe and respected in my home. I laid him down in his bed, sat<br/>\nnext to him, rubbed his forhead and started singing his song to him. He<br/>\nstopped screaming, looked at me and said, &quot;That makes me happy mama.&quot; And he<br/>\nwas asleep in about five minutes. Again, not punished, but clear limits were<br/>\nset.<br/>\n<br/>\nTCS/NCP work as a tool for me that has been really helpful in defusing my<br/>\nhigh need guy, but I&#39;m doubting whether the above scenario would jibe with<br/>\nhardcore TCS folks. I&#39;ve seen too many instances where parents in every<br/>\neffort to be non-coercive end up being coerced out the whazoo by the child.<br/>\nSome might say that&#39;s not really TCS then, but I&#39;ve seen it enough that it<br/>\nseems to be a pretty high probability.  For me rights and respect need to be<br/>\nmutual. I don&#39;t feel my kids gain anything by learning that they can coerce<br/>\nthose around them because no one will step in to coerce them out of it.

It <br/>\nseems in the context of unschooling, when i speak of &quot;noncoercive <br/>\nparenting techniques&quot;, i generally mean no forced bedtimes, meals, <br/>\nchores etc. I think coercing a child in this context can result in <br/>\nthings like an unwillingness to freely engage in behaviors (like <br/>\ncleaning)if not forced, and an atmosphere of disrespect (child more <br/>\nlikely to be disrespectful because the parent is), but i dont see how <br/>\nit would &quot;destroy one&#39;s ability of self-protection&quot;...not that i <br/>\nreally understand what you mean by those words. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For who else but the individual can know what is best for them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it is very common for individuals (adults and children)to <br/>\nmake decisions that ultimately are not good (and sometimes very bad)<br/>\nfor them. Sometimes individuals minds are so clouded by other things <br/>\n(like drugs, or a bad relationship, or being &quot;caught up in the <br/>\nmoment&quot;, or greed, etcetc)that they DONT know whats best for them. An <br/>\nexample: a family member recently went through a situation in which <br/>\nshe made legal decisions that will have long term financial <br/>\nrepercussions (contracts and such)for her. When she was riding the <br/>\n&quot;high&quot; she was on (emotional high...we think she may have been going <br/>\nthru some kind of manic phase or something) she was SO sure she was <br/>\ndoing the right thing for herself, we could not talk to her about it, <br/>\nshe thought she was making the &quot;best&quot; decisions. We felt very <br/>\nstrongly this would all turn out badly, and a month or two later, <br/>\nwhen the emotional high and the novelty wore off, she realizes (too <br/>\nlate) she made a mistake. People dont always know whats best for <br/>\nthem. And thats ok, its ok to make mistakes. But my point is that <br/>\npeople often DONT know what is best for themselves. That doesnt mean <br/>\nwe should (or shouldnt)coerce them into making what we think is the <br/>\nright decision.

They are our <br/>\nkids and according to the state, they must live under the guidelines we believe are best for <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat drew me to mindful parenting (as Sandra calls it) is that I realized that when <br/>\neveryone is aware of who has the real power, laying down those rights to control and <br/>\ncoerce is a powerful expression of love and respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut these are choices made by parents who could change the entire scheme of life in one <br/>\nfell swoop and not be in violation of the state. Kids know this. It seems disingenuous to <br/>\ntalk about rights of children if we are extending those rights beyond the rights of parents <br/>\nto raise them as they best see fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the law, children have the right to not be molested or physically beaten so as <br/>\nto leave marks. Neglect can also be quantified as abuse of a child&#39;s rights. Beyond that, <br/>\nparents have the say. And as unschoolers, I&#39;m glad.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: A whole new way of interacting?","postDate":"1091301194","msgId":97136,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMwLjVjOWZhMDNmLjJlM2Q0OTRhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":97135,"nextInTopic":97137,"prevInTime":97135,"nextInTime":97137,"topicId":97112,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/31/04 12:49:36 PM, mina@mabb.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-223252936\">In a message dated 7/31/04 12:49:36 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mina@...\">mina@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; What are basically giving our children is the illusion of ownership.

Other cultures have extended family <br/>\nphilosophies of interacting with children. Hunter/gather cultures <br/>\nhave even broader constructs of interacting with children. Basically <br/>\nparenting is a selected or assume way of interacting with children. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many ways of interacting with others, some consensual some <br/>\nauthoritarian, some compromise, etc. Many individuals are interacted <br/>\nwith as a group, some with decisions made through representation, <br/>\nsome without, just as the rights of women in our culture has changed <br/>\nwithin the family and outside the family unit. The construct varies <br/>\nwith each individual involved unless the individuals are treated as a <br/>\ngroup such as by race, sex or by age segregation. Then one&#39;s <br/>\nindividuality and self-determination is ignored. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur culture generally has a continuum of ignoring or deciding for <br/>\nchildren without representation, just as women and blacks had ignored <br/>\nor limited represenation in the past. Now in many arenas women and <br/>\nblacks have the right not to be forced to do things against their <br/>\nwill. Our culture has choosen to protect these rights legally. <br/>\nHowever, as humans these rights, whether recognized by law or not, <br/>\nare inalienable human rights of self-determination. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn consensual living with children these same inalienable human <br/>\nrights of self-determination are not obstucted by force reguardless <br/>\nof age also. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;One is responsible for the consequences of their actions.

Parenting philosophy does not supercede human rights any <br/>\nmore than the philosophy of ownership supercedes the human rights of <br/>\nslaves. The rights of the individual human reguardless of age, sex, <br/>\nreligion, nationality, sexual orientation, ability and race are not <br/>\nall legally protected rights in America. Agreed. But indeed, these <br/>\nrights are not given or conveyed by a society, individuals are born <br/>\nwith these rights. It is only when another individual supercedes <br/>\nthese inalienable rights does power over another exist. The actions <br/>\nof the second create the existence of power and control by usurping <br/>\nthe birth rights of humans to freedom of self-determination. <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren are not &quot;property&quot; (a cultural construct) any more than <br/>\nblack people ever were. It is the action of controling another&#39;s <br/>\nfreedoms that creates the power dynamic. Power only exists when one <br/>\ncan or does use it over another&#39;s will. Freedom supercedes power. One <br/>\nis born with freedom of self-determination; it is not given or <br/>\nreleased to one. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne is responsible for the consequences of their actions. That is my <br/>\npoint, it is the act of acting that creates the responsibility to <br/>\nanother if it impacts or obstucts another&#39;s freedom. One is <br/>\nresponsible not to impact or obstuct another with your choosen <br/>\nactions because their freedom pre-exists your action.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonoring another&#39;s rights to self-determination assumes that we are <br/>\nborn with self-determination. Thus, self-determination or freedom can <br/>\nonly be taken away. You seem to be saying that one is given <br/>\nopportunities for self-determination as a gift because parents have <br/>\nthe power to control. However, I believe this matrix is imposed and <br/>\nonly created by the parents&#39; choice to act against a child&#39;s will. <br/>\nAnd that the power construct does not exist when the child is not <br/>\nforced against his will. I do believe we have a responsibility not to <br/>\nforce anyone against their will because we have no right to power or <br/>\ncontrol over another human being. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the discussion. Perhaps we disagree about one&#39;s innate <br/>\nself-determination. Most two year olds I have ever met sure seem to <br/>\nhave innate self-determination. lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 7/30/2004 3:01:10 PM Mountain Daylight Time, <br/>\n&gt; scubamama@e... writes:<br/>\n&gt; However, in compromise and even in democracy someone <br/>\n&gt; concedes something.
