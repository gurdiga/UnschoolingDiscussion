If you haven&#39;t <br/>\ngone to the new page to switch your information over, be prepared!  I ended <br/>\nup having to use some weird name/number combo&#39;s before I found one that <br/>\nwasn&#39;t taken.

I told him I only ever liked and understood the <br/>\nword<br/>\nproblems, but most of my friends hated the word problems. He said the word<br/>\nproblems are the ONLY problems in math books.  The &quot;number problems&quot; are the<br/>\nsolutions to unstated problems, without the computations done.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 11yo daughter has been getting bogged down with her math. We&#39;ve been using <br/>\nSchoolzone workbooks and also tried making worksheets with the worksheet <br/>\nfactory program. (www.worksheetfactory.com ) She liked making the worksheets <br/>\nbut soon got stuck with them as well. &quot;Schoolwork&quot; is something she chooses <br/>\nto do and generally enjoys and she has asked me to help her keep going with <br/>\nit, so I didn&#39;t want to just ignore the problem. We had a conversation in <br/>\nwhich she identified that just doing the number problems was too abstract and <br/>\nmeaningless. She said that last year&#39;s workbooks had had more word problems. <br/>\nSo I went online and found www.mathstories.com. I highly recommend it. Today <br/>\nshe did her first worksheet from that site and really liked it. I could tell <br/>\nshe was learning the concepts which made it easier to remember the skills and <br/>\nprocedures themselves. We were working on long division.  She says best part <br/>\nis that the word problems showed her how these skills are used in real life. <br/>\n-Amalia-</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15358,"nextTopicId":14922}}
