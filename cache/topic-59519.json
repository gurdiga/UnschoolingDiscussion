I, Lucie have three sons who have never <br/>\n  been to school.  The first two are sixteen and are very different <br/>\n  learners.  They started reading quite naturally.  And  I have little <br/>\n  clue how it happened.  One day, we were driving looking for a certain <br/>\n  street and discussing how we would teach the twins to read ( didn&#39;t <br/>\n  grasp unschooling  then) when the twins interupted us, to tell us we had <br/>\n  pass the street we were looking for. &quot; How do you know?&quot; , I asked them. <br/>\n  &quot;We read the sign to pass the time&quot;, they answered.  WE litterally <br/>\n  didn&#39;t realised they had learned to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The third son is 10.  He was a late reader ( 9) and  still has <br/>\n  difficulty with reading.  He could recognised whole words when he was <br/>\n  three, but could not break the  phonic code until later.   Computor <br/>\n  programs like civ III  were great motivator.  So I became aware of the <br/>\n  process he went through.  First,   he stated to group the syllable and <br/>\n  associated them with sounds. His confidence was shaky at first but <br/>\n  eventually  reading  made sense.  Now he wants to read to me , to gain <br/>\n  speed...  He never wanted to read younger picture books , only chapter <br/>\n  books.  And now, he joined a book club!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Friendship<br/>\n  Lucie, in  snowy Ottawa<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Education is hanging around until you have caught on.&quot;<br/>\n      Robert Frost<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Paula Sjogerman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;on 2/24/03 12:20 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> at<br/>\n  &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt; Or are there lots of early unschooled readers<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;too, and we just aren&#39;t hearing those stories? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;    <br/>\n  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;I have one of each.
