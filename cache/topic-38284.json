Most people have had spelling in school but not all people<br/>\nspell well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that most people who avoid math do so because they have had bad<br/>\nschool experiences. But that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t people who just don&#39;t<br/>\nget math. (If you haven&#39;t read anything about Gardner&#39;s 7 intelligences, it<br/>\nmight give you insight if you did. There should be articles on line and<br/>\nThomas Armstrong has written some popular books on the subject.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s your attitude towards math? Do you tackle a math problem (adding<br/>\nscores, figuring out tax and tip and so forth) out loud so she can &quot;see&quot; the<br/>\nprocess and without hesitation. Do you ever eagerly tackle a math puzzle?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is her attitude? Does she balk at it? Does she shut down? Does she want<br/>\nto learn and has tried a number of ways and just can&#39;t get it? It could be<br/>\nthat she&#39;s internalized that math is some magic process that she&#39;s just<br/>\nsupposed to know how to do. It could be they jumped too fast from memorizing<br/>\nthe tables to doing it. If she didn&#39;t catch on that knowing how to do 17+25<br/>\nwas just a matter of having remembered what 7+5 was and wasn&#39;t something she<br/>\nwas just supposed to know, then it could be she&#39;s shut her brain down<br/>\nwhenver she&#39;s seen a math problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf *she* wants to try something, there are resources out there. Otherwise<br/>\nI&#39;d have a positive attitude towards math (or at least a positive &quot;I&#39;m not<br/>\ngoing to let this beat me&quot; attitude), solve problems outloud, play games,<br/>\nperhaps tackle some consumer math that has a purpose behind it, eg, talk<br/>\nabout credit cards (I stumbled on this:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://score.kings.k12.ca.us/lessons/crcard.htm\">http://score.kings.k12.ca.us/lessons/crcard.htm</a> but haven&#39;t really looked<br/>\ninto it yet), the stock market (there&#39;s a bunch of links to simulators for<br/>\nkids at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.surfnetkids.com/stockmkt.htm\">http://www.surfnetkids.com/stockmkt.htm</a> and over to the left is some<br/>\nother pages of real world money links for kids), income taxes, shopping<br/>\nbargains and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":111436570,"authorName":"lurningathome@aol.com","from":"lurningathome@...","profile":"tolearnwithfreedom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2107","postDate":"1023810912","msgId":38285,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI0LmNjOWJhNDYuMmEzNzc3NjBAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":38284,"nextInTopic":38294,"prevInTime":38284,"nextInTime":38286,"topicId":38284,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/10/2002 5:09:10 PM Central Daylight Time, ...
