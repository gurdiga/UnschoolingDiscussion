So ds started kissing<br/>\nhis chocolate mousse. Little pecks on the dessert<br/>\ndish. His friend asked him, &quot;Do you love her?&quot; Ds<br/>\nreplied, &quot;He, it&#39;s a boy.&quot; His friend said, &quot;Oh, are<br/>\nyou gay then?&quot; Ds replied, &quot;No, it&#39;s not my husband,<br/>\nit&#39;s my baby.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe gay question was asked nonchalantly and without<br/>\nany hint of judgment. It was answered nonchalantly and<br/>\nwithout any hint of defensiveness. <br/>\n<br/>\nA new generation of tolerance? <br/>\n<br/>\nJuli<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nYou cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself --Galileo<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I would also want to talk about the<br/>\nother side of the coin, as to why his partners might<br/>\nchoose him, and what they do that might be bad<br/>\nchoices.
