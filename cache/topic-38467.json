I would literally have to put his shoes<br/>\nand socks on for him to get him dressed so we could<br/>\nget to class.   Finally one day I told him I was<br/>\nleaving in 15 minutes  and he just laid there, Five<br/>\nminutes later I warned him I was leaving  five minutes<br/>\nafter that I warned him one more time  and then I just<br/>\nleft when I said I would.   He missed school and work<br/>\nthat day and the next day he got up and got dressed<br/>\nand got out to the car on time  and I never had a<br/>\nproblem after that..so sometimes a person just has to<br/>\ngive up and let the person take responsibility.   My<br/>\nsons are the same way.  If I give an inch they take a<br/>\nmile.  But one time of having to live with the<br/>\nconsequences  and they seem to learn whereas if there<br/>\nare no consquences  if I always do everything for them<br/>\n then they just take advantage of that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Tia Leschke &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also would wake someone up under those<br/>\n&gt; circumstances.
