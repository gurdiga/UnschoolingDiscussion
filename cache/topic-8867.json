He had also sent similar letters to <br/>\nstudents at the town&#39;s junior high schools. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkita, 54, said that the hoisting of the Hinomaru national flag and the <br/>\nsinging of Kimigayo at school ceremonies will be strictly observed in the <br/>\nproposed new school, which will conduct education in compliance with <br/>\nMinistry of Education guidelines, local sources said. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also said that the new school will offer the town residents more <br/>\nchoices in education. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnder the plan, an educational foundation will soon be established by <br/>\nseveral promoters, including a former principal of a prefectural senior <br/>\nhigh school. The foundation will then collect contributions from those <br/>\nwho endorse the planned school, which is expected to open in April next <br/>\nyear admitting 30 pupils in the first grade. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe town government is expected to repair an abandoned municipal <br/>\nelementary school for its new venture. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnnual operating costs of about 50 million yen will also be subsidized by <br/>\nthe municipality. Children of town residents will be exempted from paying <br/>\nthe admission fee of about 50,000 yen and monthly tuition of about 18,000 <br/>\nyen, granting them the same conditions as those who attend public schools. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[copyright 2000 - The Mainichi Newspapers Co.]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8865,"nextTopicId":8868}}
