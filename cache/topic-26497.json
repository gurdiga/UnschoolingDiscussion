Karri, your suggestion of doing some weekly goal <br/>\nsetting was great. It will give us a way to set down a written plan so I can <br/>\ngive him the nudge he wants and needs in the directions HE wants to take. My <br/>\nplan is to set some goals for myself, since we can companionably nudge.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L, your input about his needing me nearby was also right on.

Often <br/>\nhe will spend many hours playing games on his computer, which would be fine <br/>\nif that didn&#39;t get in the way of what he REALLY wanted to accomplish.
