I&#39;ve also made the comment about <br/>\nschool being optional to principals in the past.  It causes problems, BIG <br/>\nproblems.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fifth grade it was brought to my attention for about the fifth time that <br/>\nmy child had TOO many absences.  This was in Feb. and she had missed about <br/>\nsixty days or so and they felt they were going to HAVE to report me to the <br/>\n&quot;proper&quot; agency if she missed even one more day.  I asked them WHY?  They (five <br/>\npeople) went on to spin a tale of how it was adversely affecting her school life <br/>\nand just simply wasn&#39;t good for her and wouldn&#39;t be tolerated any longer.  I <br/>\nsaid open up the grade book, she had not one mark that was lower than <br/>\noutstanding.  So I pointed this out and asked EXACTLY how it was affecting her so <br/>\nadversely.  They couldn&#39;t say anything other than the &quot;party line&quot; that it was <br/>\ndetrimental to learning if she was only there one day a week or sometimes none or <br/>\nsometimes three.  They reiterated that school was NOT optional and attendance <br/>\nwas required to pass to the next grade.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I didn&#39;t seem &quot;moved&quot; enough by their pleas to do what was BEST for <br/>\nmy child, so next report card, to get my attention and my child&#39;s, they put <br/>\nfailing grades on EVERY subject.  My child cried all the way home and all <br/>\nevening.  No matter how much I tried to tell her it didn&#39;t matter.  I went in for the <br/>\nobligatory conference and indeed she had still done &quot;outstanding&quot; on her work <br/>\nand nothing was &quot;missing&quot; but they felt they needed to &quot;make a point!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to make MY point that if she could stay &quot;caught up&quot; by attending only <br/>\none day a week more or less what did it say about their school system or more <br/>\nclearly her classroom?  There wasn&#39;t anything more challenging for her to do <br/>\nand they didn&#39;t try to make anything more challenging.  So we did LOTS of <br/>\nthings on our own on the days she didn&#39;t attend school, something&#39;s that she <br/>\nbrought back and shared on days she was there and other students then got to <br/>\nexperience through her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had no answer for being able to attend once a week more or less and <br/>\nstill be on target with the rest of the class.  The only thing I could figure out <br/>\nwas that she didn&#39;t really need to be there at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTook a while longer to convince DH that school was not necessary and even my <br/>\ndaughter LIKED the once or twice a week interaction with the kids and even the <br/>\nteacher but we didn&#39;t like being told what was BEST for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe LOVES being home all the time now, she said sometimes she does miss the <br/>\nsocial aspect of it but she still goes to ball games and dances and stuff, but <br/>\nI think she&#39;d like to meet more kids her age and not have to actively seek <br/>\nthem out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, back to the topic of telling you that I really enjoyed reading the <br/>\nstory of your sister and how things naturally fell into place for her and her <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Read a story from Sandra in a book last night","postDate":"1055009617","msgId":72756,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRlLjFkNWVkYTEwLjJjMTM4NTUxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":72742,"nextInTopic":72772,"prevInTime":72755,"nextInTime":72757,"topicId":72742,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That s in Linda Dobson s Homeschool Book of Answers.
