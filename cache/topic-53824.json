I thought the <br/>\n&gt; whole world parented that way! What a shock to return to the <br/>\n&gt; states find out that the Ezzos had influenced every one of my <br/>\n&gt; friends from college... Argh!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband and I have also been through our share of therapy <br/>\n&gt; and I vowed to listen to our kids and tuck away $25.00 depostis <br/>\n&gt; each time we damaged them against the day they&#39;d need that <br/>\n&gt; insurance for thearpy to get over us. :) We used to say, &quot;We don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; save for college. We save for their therapy.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, Jon and I have been in the conservative Christian world <br/>\n&gt; for the last twenty years. We have gone through a significant shift <br/>\n&gt; in our theological beliefs (are currently churchless) and find that <br/>\n&gt; that world no longer matches who we&#39;ve become (or more <br/>\n&gt; accurately, who we used to be and liked being). The typical <br/>\n&gt; comments from those who know us about not setting limits (we <br/>\n&gt; have set some, but compared to all who know us, we&#39;re the <br/>\n&gt; liberal, loosey-goosey ones) is that we&#39;re inviting rebellion. <br/>\n&gt; Ironically, if there are no rules against which to rebel, I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know how there could be rebellion. I suppose they mean that our <br/>\n&gt; kids will slide into irretrievable immorality.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Many of the mothers I know feel that they must set guidelines for <br/>\n&gt; behavior so that their kids will be conditioned to understand <br/>\n&gt; certain values. Yet one of my daughter&#39;s best friends (who is in <br/>\n&gt; the most restrictive home we know) tried to kill herself last year <br/>\n&gt; and is now plotting all the things she will do to herself once she <br/>\n&gt; is 18 (from listening to rap, to piercing ever possible body part to <br/>\n&gt; living with a boyfriend).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ironically, just since Monday when we shared our changed view <br/>\n&gt; of things with our kids, I&#39;ve already encountered doubts in  my <br/>\n&gt; own kids. They worry that they will make bad decisions for  <br/>\n&gt; themselves. A couple of them said to me that they wondered if <br/>\n&gt; this &quot;new thing would really work.&quot; They worried that they would <br/>\n&gt; make bad choices if left to themselves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This floored me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My 13 dd said, &quot;Can we listen to Eminem?&quot; I said that I would <br/>\n&gt; like to listen to it with her, if she&#39;s interested so we can talk<br/>\n&gt; about it. She freaked, &quot;Mom, you&#39;re my mother. Just say no. You <br/>\n&gt; can say no to me. How can I ever rebel against you if you set no <br/>\n&gt; rules? I&#39;m going to call you Mrs. Bogart.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve since talked more about it, but I have to admit that I was <br/>\n&gt; surprised that inside she had this picture of individuating <br/>\n&gt; through some kind of rebellion. I wonder now if the very <br/>\n&gt; guidelines parents set for their kids predispose them to think in <br/>\n&gt; terms of rebelling for the sake of individual growth rather than a <br/>\n&gt; natural process of personal discernment that evolves as the <br/>\n&gt; child ages.

Someone my age commented on Holly know those <br/>\nlyrics.  I said, &quot;HEY, she knows Rocky Horror Picture Show and the South Park <br/>\nmovie too.&quot;  They laughed and said she shouldn&#39;t sing them in public or the <br/>\ncounty would come and talk to me, but they weren&#39;t really offended, because <br/>\nthey&#39;ve known Holly her own life and she&#39;s pretty cool. <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Holly had a tentative invite for a day at the mall with a sixteen <br/>\nyear old friend and a friend Holly&#39;s age she hasn&#39;t seen for over a year.  <br/>\nShe said, &quot;Rainelle&#39;s turning twelve soon, and I can tell her &#39;Now you can <br/>\nwatch Rocky Horror Picture Show.&#39;&quot;   Holly  said Rainelle&#39;s mom said she <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t watch it until she was twelve.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...<br/>\nHolly has watched it before it could possibly have any meaning or shock <br/>\nvalue, and knows lots of the songs.

But as far as I can see and understand,  the changes that you are making and so many of us are attempting to do will hopefully alliviate that from happening,   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  and..from what I&#39;ve heard from unschooling families with older children... it is working!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** We have gone through a significant shift <br/>\n  in our theological beliefs (are currently churchless) and find that <br/>\n  that world no longer matches who we&#39;ve become (or more <br/>\n  accurately, who we used to be and liked being).**<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ditto for us,  and this is what I am really struggling with right now,   I feel very alone and isolated,  except on this list,   <br/>\n<br/>\n      but I do feel like what we (my fam)are doing is the right thing and am feeling stronger and stronger about it all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kelli<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  First of all, I LOVE this list!! I feel like I just found the gals I<br/>\n  started this parenting journey with. My husband and I lived in <br/>\n  Morocco as missionaries during our early years of parenting and <br/>\n  only knew two sources for those life skills--our intuition and a <br/>\n  few books sent to me written by Dr. Sears and LLL. I thought the <br/>\n  whole world parented that way! What a shock to return to the <br/>\n  states find out that the Ezzos had influenced every one of my <br/>\n  friends from college... Argh!<br/>\n<br/>\n  My husband and I have also been through our share of therapy <br/>\n  and I vowed to listen to our kids and tuck away $25.00 depostis <br/>\n  each time we damaged them against the day they&#39;d need that <br/>\n  insurance for thearpy to get over us. :) We used to say, &quot;We don&#39;t <br/>\n  save for college. We save for their therapy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, Jon and I have been in the conservative Christian world <br/>\n  for the last twenty years. We have gone through a significant shift <br/>\n  in our theological beliefs (are currently churchless) and find that <br/>\n  that world no longer matches who we&#39;ve become (or more <br/>\n  accurately, who we used to be and liked being). The typical <br/>\n  comments from those who know us about not setting limits (we <br/>\n  have set some, but compared to all who know us, we&#39;re the <br/>\n  liberal, loosey-goosey ones) is that we&#39;re inviting rebellion. <br/>\n  Ironically, if there are no rules against which to rebel, I don&#39;t<br/>\n  know how there could be rebellion. I suppose they mean that our <br/>\n  kids will slide into irretrievable immorality.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Many of the mothers I know feel that they must set guidelines for <br/>\n  behavior so that their kids will be conditioned to understand <br/>\n  certain values. Yet one of my daughter&#39;s best friends (who is in <br/>\n  the most restrictive home we know) tried to kill herself last year <br/>\n  and is now plotting all the things she will do to herself once she <br/>\n  is 18 (from listening to rap, to piercing ever possible body part to <br/>\n  living with a boyfriend).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ironically, just since Monday when we shared our changed view <br/>\n  of things with our kids, I&#39;ve already encountered doubts in  my <br/>\n  own kids. They worry that they will make bad decisions for  <br/>\n  themselves. A couple of them said to me that they wondered if <br/>\n  this &quot;new thing would really work.&quot; They worried that they would <br/>\n  make bad choices if left to themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This floored me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My 13 dd said, &quot;Can we listen to Eminem?&quot; I said that I would <br/>\n  like to listen to it with her, if she&#39;s interested so we can talk<br/>\n  about it. She freaked, &quot;Mom, you&#39;re my mother. Just say no. You <br/>\n  can say no to me. How can I ever rebel against you if you set no <br/>\n  rules? I&#39;m going to call you Mrs. Bogart.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  We&#39;ve since talked more about it, but I have to admit that I was <br/>\n  surprised that inside she had this picture of individuating <br/>\n  through some kind of rebellion. I wonder now if the very <br/>\n  guidelines parents set for their kids predispose them to think in <br/>\n  terms of rebelling for the sake of individual growth rather than a <br/>\n  natural process of personal discernment that evolves as the <br/>\n  child ages. Have we bred rebellion into teen life in an effort to <br/>\n  scuplt who they are and what they value?<br/>\n<br/>\n  What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Julie B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
