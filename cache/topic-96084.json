Admittedly in a very strange way. Her  teacher gave her a rubber traingle shaped thingy to put on her pencil. I &quot;helpfully&quot; bought a couple more for her to use at home. We were all  on her like  gum on a stick   everytime she was supposed to write something. They both  got  &quot;eagle eye&quot; comments on how they formed their letters. They Had to start from the bottom ( or was that the top  ?  ;-) ) <br/>\n We started Homeschooling half way through Kindergarten. We did relaxed homeschooling-I continued to &quot;helpfully&quot;  get them to  hold their pencils in the &quot;right&quot; way. To  form their letters in the &quot;right&quot; way. One became anxious-one became defiant-then they both became anxious and defiant. I asked for only a little writing-same thing. No way did they Ever try to write anything on their own.<br/>\n Last year they went back to school   ( grade 2  )  one for 3/4 of the year the other for part of two weeks.<br/>\n The teacher of one sent homework the very first day that consisted  of practicing printing the Right way. No way did it get even attempted.<br/>\nMy mental jouney thru all of this  for three years  had now led me to understand Unschooling -we started in May of last year. One year later. They write reams of stuff from their NeoPets games. My computer desk is full of it-they ask  dozens of times a day how to spell words. I can read their printing. I never comment on it. I dont know or care  where they start their letters.they do  write clearer than my doctors-LOL<br/>\nAll that rubber thingies-practice etc. leads to is a feeling that They are not good enough to write-that nothing they write is quite good enough. -rubber aids point it out to them every minute. <br/>\nMy handwriting is awful-I had all kinds of instruction. Before computers I wrote a Lot-I love words-<br/>\nI bought a big book from a used book store that had dozens of decorative  and unusual ways of making letters. I give them calligraphy type pens-I show them how to make big fancy scrolley letters-they have 4x8  blackboards in their room (blackboard paint on masonite) they have colored chalk. They play with writing-their friends play with writing-Its coming.

That <br/>\nisn&#39;t what I get from him when we talk.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHas he always been like this, or is it worse or more<br/>\nextreme these days?  If so, I would like to gently<br/>\nremind you that he&#39;s growing, fast, physically and<br/>\nemotionally, and that is enough to handle at one time.<br/>\n There might be lots of stuff going on with him that<br/>\nyou&#39;re unaware of.

But lots is going on, it&#39;s just that I<br/>\ndon&#39;t see it as much as I used to. I&#39;m not in on the<br/>\nprocess as much as I used to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the great thing about unschooling, patience and<br/>\ntime is available to him, as much as he needs and<br/>\nwants.  Try to remind yourself of that, because it&#39;s<br/>\npossible he&#39;s picking up your wants for him as<br/>\npressure on himself.  He&#39;s going at his own pace, and<br/>\nlike you said about reading, he&#39;ll do it eventually,<br/>\nwhen he needs it, when it&#39;s important enough to him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been having some doubts, too, at this age, about<br/>\nmultiplication tables, and his writing.

Computers are better  for lists <br/>\nbecause you can reorder the list alphabetically or if you use a  spreadsheet or <br/>\ntable, according to the date the birds were first seen or by  quantity.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe use the bird guide with post-its to keep up with the birds we&#39;ve seen in  <br/>\nthe yard.  He could draw a sketch of each bird he sees and put it in a  file.  <br/>\nThere are lots of way to keep up with stuff like that.<br/>\n <br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"One follow up comment on my ten year old","postDate":"1089209806","msgId":96084,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjaDBrZStlZzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":96085,"prevInTime":96083,"nextInTime":96085,"topicId":96084,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In rereading my message, I just wanted to say that I haven t made artifical attempts to teach him (like setting up times and using curricula).

I&#39;ve used Family Math for math <br/>\ngames and have invited whoever wants to play to come. Usually my other two who are <br/>\nhome with me are rarin&#39; to go. My ten year old usually listens while on the computer. <br/>\nOccasionally he will join us, but he then gets frustrated or bored and leaves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd with writing, he has a bird list he wants to keep but the chore of writing prevents him <br/>\nfrom keeping it up. Yet he has no interest in working on forming the letters or working on <br/>\nit as a skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the same child who at five told me one day, &quot;Mom, I will not be taught.&quot; And that&#39;s <br/>\nbeen basically true. He also said he would never learn to read since he would never need <br/>\nto. On his own, one year, he figure it out (he was 7). So I know he has the power to learn <br/>\nwhen he wants to in his own time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m now just concerned about showing that he is learning in a way that satisfies the state.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, he is sometimes inclined to make self-deprecating comments that indicate to me <br/>\nthat he doesn&#39;t think of himself as smart of able to learn what other kids learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis might be too complicated for the list, but if you have any insight, I&#39;d appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96134,"nextTopicId":96144}}
