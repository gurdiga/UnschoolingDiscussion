At home, and following an unschooling philosophy is my son  Hayden <br/>\n(12), son Logan (10) and daughter Holly (8), myself and my husband.<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t come by unschooling naturally I&#39;m disappointed to say, but now  <br/>\nthat we are here we don&#39;t know what took us so long!  All of my children  have <br/>\nbeen in public school but we are reveling in being together at home.<br/>\nThe recent post from another Linda with a son, Logan, caught my  attention.<br/>\nOur Logan sounds very similar.  At 8, a lot of things his siblings  could do <br/>\nwere difficult and often impossible for Logan.  I agree with the  several <br/>\nposts that encourage you to wait and let him move at his own speed  without any <br/>\ninterference, no matter how well intentioned.<br/>\nAt 10, Logan is growing gradually into his body and managing very  nicely.  <br/>\nHe now loves to cook and can spread his own peanut butter.   He does not ride a <br/>\nbike or tie his shoes or other things some people equate with  a 10 year <br/>\nold&#39;s abilities.  He did have vision problems, caught early at  the age of 4 - but <br/>\nnot early enough.  He has little depth perception but  can compensate very <br/>\nwell.  He has seen a pediatric optholmolgist (a  children&#39;s eye dr./surgeon) for <br/>\n6 years and wears a rather strong prescription  pair of glasses.  His eyes <br/>\nare improving, though, and he recently had his  prescription reduced from the <br/>\nstrongest available to the next notch down.   Dr. says by age 13 or 14, he may <br/>\nnot need lenses at all if his eyes continue to  strengthen.<br/>\nI&#39;ve enjoyed the sharing and the experienced voices on this list and have  <br/>\nall ready absorbed a great deal.<br/>\nThank you, all, and I look forward to reading/learning/sharing more.<br/>\nLinda in Ann Arbor, MI<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94255,"nextTopicId":94319}}
