(I had read Summerhill when I was 14, and that pretty well ruined <br/>\nschool for me.....the little that wasn&#39;t already ruined.)  After a couple <br/>\nof years I went to college.  I also noticed a *huge* difference.  Students <br/>\nwere treated like adults, capable of making their own decisions about what <br/>\nto wear and whether to skip a class.

I had a choice to <br/>\ngo to private school but I would have had to sell my pony. I chose my pony. <br/>\nThen in HS I tried to quit but my Mom said no. I also tried in my Sr. year <br/>\nbut I would have had to be 18 to take my GED and that was the condition then. <br/>\nI turned 18 the summer after grad..  Hmmmm wonder if she wonders if I would <br/>\nhave been better off outta there? I did end up going to college when I was 21 <br/>\nand had a great GPA and transferred to a large *big college. But I quit w/ 14 <br/>\ncredits to go. I was burned out and I suddenly realized I wasn&#39;t as sure of <br/>\nmy end result as I wanted to be for spending that much money. She still gets <br/>\non me about going to that college and what a waste it was of money. I say it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t b/c I learned a whole new way. College was great compared to High <br/>\nSchool. Why no one ever told me that blows my mind. They are so ingrained in <br/>\nthe system that if your not following right along why think this child might <br/>\nactually do better in a college setting. I told them over and over it was <br/>\nlike being in jail. The counselors gave up and I barely got out of <br/>\nthere.Stupid!<br/>\n<br/>\n    My mother had an art scholarship but got pregnant so she never went to <br/>\ncollege.

She <br/>\nis so damn sure about all her ideas and beliefs she squashes others. Yet she <br/>\nconstantly feels she doesn&#39;t deserve what she has. Really it isn&#39;t much <br/>\neither. She still works her ass off to keep her horses and barely makes ends <br/>\nmeet. She is a fantastic artist but makes her living hanging wallpaper and it <br/>\nis physically taking its toll. She isn&#39;t confident in her artistic abilities <br/>\nto make money. I know she could.<br/>\n<br/>\n   It seems so complicated, she is so adamant about issues and such that <br/>\nshe&#39;ll argue to the death. Yet your right she isn&#39;t confident in her own <br/>\nability. She is confident to say No to someone and I am not.
