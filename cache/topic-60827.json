It&#39;s not the same &quot;set.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; The Buddha says we should start by refraining from telling lies. After <br/>\nthat, we should speak the truth, speak gently and politely and speak at the <br/>\nright time. He says: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Giving up false speech he becomes a speaker of truth, reliable, trustworthy, <br/>\ndependable, he does not deceive the world. Giving up malicious speech he does <br/>\nnot repeat there what he has heard here no does he repeat here what he has <br/>\nheard there in order to cause variance between people. He reconciles those <br/>\nwho are divided and brings closer together those who are already friends. <br/>\nHarmony is his joy, harmony is his delight, harmony is his love; it is the <br/>\nmotive of his speech. Giving up harsh speech his speech is blameless, <br/>\npleasing to the ear, agreeable, going to the heart, urbane, liked by most. <br/>\nGiving up idle chatter he speaks at the right time, what is correct, to the <br/>\npoint, about Dhamma and about discipline. He speaks words worth being <br/>\ntreasured up, seasonable, reasonable, well defined and to the point.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.singnet.com.sg/~alankhoo/FivePreceptsQA.htm\">http://web.singnet.com.sg/~alankhoo/FivePreceptsQA.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Calling all Buddhists AND Question on Right Speech","postDate":"1047485514","msgId":60864,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkOS40ZTY4NDBmLjJiYTBiNjRhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":60827,"nextInTopic":60867,"prevInTime":60863,"nextInTime":60865,"topicId":60827,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/11/03 6:41:10 PM, mkirk@columbus.rr.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1653461910\">In a message dated 3/11/03 6:41:10 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mkirk@...\">mkirk@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  &quot;Is it true?<br/>\nIs it kind?
