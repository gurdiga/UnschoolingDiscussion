But I will tell you something funny. Yes she reads on an adult level and if you ask her what she just read she explains it to you and breaks it down. She has an uncanny way with words and how she uses them. That is one child that I have never had to say..you used the word wrong. She not only knows how to say them, but she knows what they mean. Her interpersonal skills are wicked good. She can see someone either her age, younger or older and begin to a conversation with them like nothing. Sometimes you forget that you are speaking to an 8 year old. I have actually witnessed her dumbing down herself so as not to get &quot;ridden&quot; by children her own age. Her one problem is her math. But that is not because she does not know it, she just does not feel the need to use it right now. When she does need it she is brilliant, but if she cannot see the application for it in the here and now then forget it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYoki<br/>\nI cried unto the Lord with my voice, <br/>\nand He heard me out of His holy hill.<br/>\nSelah<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, April 08, 2003 1:52 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] how to make/get....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 4/8/03 6:46:45 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yhanley@...\">yhanley@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; I see her the same way.

Read about Howard Gardner&#39;s multiple <br/>\n  intelligences if you haven&#39;t already.  &#39;Extremely intelligent&#39; applied just <br/>\n  to verbal is what schools have been doing for a long, long time.

And someone who is an incredible artist, dancer and <br/>\n  counsellor can be declared mentally deficient by those same measures.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is altogether very, very bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And the other suggestion I have is to re-think &quot;reading at an adult level.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just because someone can sound out derision doesn&#39;t mean she knows what it <br/>\n  can mean and has felt it.  Just because someone can speak aloud words about <br/>\n  love and motherhood and sexual arousal and grief doesn&#39;t mean she has the <br/>\n  first CLUE what she&#39;s reading about.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Reading is much more than phonics.  It has to do with the stimulation of <br/>\n  thought and ideas.  Most good readers don&#39;t even have a phonics second when <br/>\n  they&#39;re reading fluently.  They don&#39;t turn those words back into sounds in <br/>\n  the air, but go straight to thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Until she has the understanding an adult has, she can&#39;t read at an adult <br/>\n  level.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not trying to make you feel bad, I&#39;m trying to open up your field of <br/>\n  vision so you see the world as big as it is instead of looking at it through <br/>\n  the small lens of school thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I guess it &gt;has not even lived up to MY expectations of<br/>\nwhat homeschooling should be.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybd you could try to find out just exactly what she misses about school.<br/>\nIs it friends?  Help her find some new ones or find ways to stay connected<br/>\nwith the ones from school.  Does she believe she&#39;s not learning anything?<br/>\nTry keeping a learning log for her.

Am I right in assuming it&#39;s<br/>\nschool type work?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes. I should know better. But I was so great in school and I see her the same way. I was the child who was in every advance class from since the sixth grade and before then was always on top. Actually before I was in the advance classes, school was beginning to get boring. My only traumatic  course in school was math. I tell my children that I earned my D in calculus when I graduated from High school doing freshman college math.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see her the same way. She is an extremely intelligent child. To speak with her you would be amazed. She was reading at an adult level by the time she was in second grade. But now it is as if she is interested in the TV more than doing her work. That is not to say that she won&#39;t pick up a book when she is ready or do something else constructive, but I guess when all you know is a regimented structured type of education it is hard to think outside of the box. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If you make sure his experiences with books are always pleasurable --<br/>\nsnuggle under a blanket on the couch with some hot chocolate, read in bed --<br/>\nthen he will read when he finds it useful for him and when he&#39;s<br/>\ndevelopmentally ready.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh I do!! When we go to the library I let him pick out what he wants to read and then we read it when we get home. Right now he has a book on water experiments that he is enjoying looking through and I read it to him when he wants me to. His favorite show right now is the Magic School bus and Sesame Street. SO I let him watch those. Not to mention Dora The Explorer. My children are half Spanish so are continually asking me to speak it to them. Though I don&#39;t know enough to teach them correctly. But I try to make it interesting.<br/>\nFor all of them, the 8 year old included, just found out that they have Amerindian blood in them, so that has led to a pique..at least for the 8 year old, in books dealing with Amerindian studies. But unfortunately the books here and the information is difficulty to come by. But the interest is there.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Kids instinctively know how<br/>\nthey&#39;re made to learn: by playing. That&#39;s what they want to do and they make<br/>\nit very clear that we&#39;re trying to make them go against their nature. We<br/>\nhave to learn to *listen* to what they&#39;re telling us (by their actions and<br/>\ntheir words) rather than what the experts tell us.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you are right here Joyce so I think I need an unschooling course myself. I had to deal yesterday with my oldest - the 11 year old - crying that she hates homeschooling and that she wants to go back to school. Which frustrated me to no end because when I told them that I would be doing the homeschooling this was the one who yelled out Hooray!! the loudest and could not wait to begin. I guess it has not even lived up to MY expectations of what homeschooling should be. I was keeping them current with what they were doing in school, but then just went a different path. I saw that they were not interested and began just doing history a lot or having them write stories alot. Which my second, the 10 year old - enjoys doing. I can see that I have a lot to learn before I can even begin to school them properly. And now I have my 2 year old showing and interest in reading. Right now she is looking through the science book the 5 year old took out. And I can hear my mother belittling me about not putting more of an emphasis on the reading and if I do not get to them before age 3 then everything is lost and they will never regain those lost years and.....<br/>\n<br/>\nYoki<br/>\n<br/>\nI cried unto the Lord with my voice, <br/>\nand He heard me out of His holy hill.<br/>\nSelah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":98546906,"authorName":"yhanley@attglobal.net","from":"&lt;yhanley@...&gt;","profile":"selahs_soaps","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] how to make/get....","postDate":"1049801699","msgId":63572,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGUwMWMyZmRjMiRlNDBjMjg4MCQ5ZTFlNDEwY0Brcm5lczE+","referencesHeader":"PGQwLjM3OWExZDRmLjJiYzM2Yzg0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":63569,"nextInTopic":63575,"prevInTime":63571,"nextInTime":63573,"topicId":63519,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Sandra.

Basically I put<br/>\na schooly bent on our everyday lives (talking about how he is adding numbers without<br/>\nmentioning that he learned it by playing Parcheesi instead of doing a math worksheet).<br/>\nBasically I beat my dad to the punch...once he reads a detail email about all the great<br/>\nthings that we are doing he doesn&#39;t have to ask and it puts his mind at ease.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has worked great so far. My dad feels more at ease because he can see the what I see<br/>\nevery day...that Jason is learning like crazy. And it is easier for me to do since I do<br/>\nnot have to think things up on the spot. Plus it really is nice for the grandparents<br/>\nto see what the boys are interested in. And then if my dad still gets on my case I remind him<br/>\nthat Jason is only 6! LOL! Oh and btw, Jason has not started reading yet and I don&#39;t really<br/>\nexpect him too. He loves rhyming, loves word play (thinks that it is cool that a word can<br/>\nhave 2 different meanings) and has an awesome vocabulary so I am not much worried. Plus<br/>\nI know Jason...he will wait until he is more then ready and then do it overnight.

I have five children, four of whom are school age and the youngest is just wanting to do everything :o)<br/>\nMy problem is this, My third and fourth child do not want to seem to do anything. My third is 8 and in..when she was in school...at the 4th grade level. She is a very intelligent child, but it is getting very hard for  me to keep her interest in anything. The same for my fourth child. He is 5 and refuses to do any reading. Now my mother is a teacher so when she gets in she asks what have they done. My son is like, nothing and the other one just looks at you with a blank look.<br/>\nI am beginning to wonder if I have made the right decision in homeschooling them. What should I do. My third child gave her teacher the same hell that she gives me...as a matter of fact so does my son...so I do not feel so bad. But what can I do.<br/>\nI am feeling a bit crazy here.<br/>\n<br/>\nYoki<br/>\nI cried unto the Lord with my voice, <br/>\nand He heard me out of His holy hill.<br/>\nSelah<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63515,"nextTopicId":63412}}
