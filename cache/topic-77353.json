I meant literal emergencies with the potential of death, like the <br/>\nrunning in the street example.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou would like to have meant that.  In retrospective you would like for it to <br/>\nseem that&#39;s what you meant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to justify spanking without being a hypocrite.<br/>\nIt&#39;s really difficult to justify spanking to THIS list without backpedalling <br/>\nat least and retracting or painting over original statements.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s baffling, and a little amusing, that you keep trying to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a traditional story in New Mexico (and along some of the rivers in <br/>\nnorthern Mexico), especially common in Northern New Mexico.<br/>\n<br/>\nA version I heard in Tesuque, just north of Santa Fe, was told about a place <br/>\nin an arroyo right below where I was living, and concerned the one tiny <br/>\ngrocery store in that town.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe story is generically called &quot;La Llorona,&quot; and usually involves a baby <br/>\ndrowning in a river, but this town has no running water, just a deep arroyo, a <br/>\ncanyon where water only runs in heavy rains.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mother had gone shopping and on the way back she had her baby in one arm <br/>\nand her groceries in the other.  She tripped and was falling and she didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to drop the groceries, so she squeezed them really tight, but she <br/>\naccidently squeezed the baby side too tight and the baby died.  (So she moans and cries <br/>\nat night, when the wind blows, because she misses her baby.  All those <br/>\nstories are told to explain wind-in-trees noise, and to warn children not to wander <br/>\naround alone in the dark at night, and to take good care of babies.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you first told your spanking story, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:OomYaaqub@...\">OomYaaqub@...</a>, I thought about <br/>\nhow you AND la llorona might have just dropped the groceries to take care of <br/>\nthe baby.  Maybe the life and death situations shouldn&#39;t value groceries so <br/>\nhighly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child is too young to understand the difference between the road and <br/>\nnot-the-road, isn&#39;t he young enough to be carried in a backpack or a stroller?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77142,"nextTopicId":77345}}
