But in a psychology class long ago we were told, in the <br/>\narea of any substance being dangerous in sufficient amounts, that a young woman&#39;s <br/>\nfather died, and she started drinking water.   She drank and drank until she <br/>\ndied a few days later.   Her kidneys weren&#39;t working and there was water in <br/>\nher lungs.   She drowned herself from the inside, overloaded her system--even <br/>\nwater, we were told, can kill you if you don&#39;t balance things out.<br/>\n<br/>\nReactions to death and disease are interesting, but the attempted magic <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t bring the people back.

My aunty ( died at age <br/>\n63 from lung cancer, my cousin died at age 40 from lung cancer. Mu <br/>\nucnle died of brain tumour,he didn&#39;t smoke but he breathed their <br/>\nsmoke for years and years. My grandfather although he had a long <br/>\nlife died from cancer of the oesophagus and lung caused by smoking. <br/>\nNon of them but my aunty and cousin were related by blood as there <br/>\nare stepfamilies and adoptions in my family.<br/>\n<br/>\n My ex husband&#39;s grandmother died of cancer of the bronchials (can&#39;t <br/>\nremember the right term) caused by smoking.  His dad literally <br/>\ndropped dead at home from a massive coronary at age 56, he smoked <br/>\nand ate too much saturated and trans fat. My stepfather has liver <br/>\ndisease and a cancer called Waldenstrom&#39;s macroglobulin anaemia. He <br/>\ndrank too much and smoked,he didn&#39;t even make retirement he had to <br/>\nbe retired on health grounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people who can get away with smoking, drinking and living <br/>\non lard, same as some people get away with not maintaining the <br/>\nbrakes on their car, but most people are not or will not be so lucky.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are exceptions to the rule but I firmly believe that a healthy <br/>\ndiet and not smoking is best for most people. That doesn&#39;t mean a <br/>\nlittle of what you fancy now and again is a bad thing. I like the <br/>\nocassional icecream, pizza, cheese, chocolate or cake. I don&#39;t eat <br/>\nthem all the time though.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy cousin was dead at 40 from lung cancer. I gave up smoking, I&#39;m <br/>\nglad I did. I&#39;m now 41, I wish my cousin was still here. <br/>\n<br/>\n                            BWs Elaine<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My 83 year old Mamaw had been a junk-eating fool when she could <br/>\n </span></blockquote>get it.   <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yes, in the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s she ate more non-processed foods, not <br/>\n </span></blockquote>counting the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; addition of SPAM and Vienna Sausage and such canned meats.

Except for when grandma made homemade chicken and noodles, but there was nothing low fat about those, just delicious.:0) My grandparents did garden and can some, more on a hobby type basis though.  They would make a relish or a jam just because they liked it better than what they could buy.  Some of my relatives smoked, some didn&#39;t.  They all lived into their 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s anyway, but the ones who didn&#39;t smoke did seem to be healthier and more active.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My mother still eats spam:0)  It&#39;s one of her favorite meals, spam, eggs and biscutis.  I never buy it, had too much of it as a kid.<br/>\n  One interesting thing, they all ate the same stuff, none were obese, some were a bit heavier than others, but weight was of no particular issue.  None of them lived on farms or did farm work.  Conventional wisdom says they should have died young or fat, but they didn&#39;t.  <br/>\n  The main difference I notice is portions today are different.  I have my grandparents&#39; juice glasses, and they are quite small.  The bowls and saucers in the set of dishes I have are smaller than what you would get if you bought new ones.  I&#39;ve often thought that these smaller dishers did cause them to eat less at a time.<br/>\n  Ann<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n  My 83 year old Mamaw had been a junk-eating fool when she could get it.   <br/>\nYes, in the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s she ate more non-processed foods, not counting the <br/>\naddition of SPAM and Vienna Sausage and such canned meats.

I have a picture of her on my  fridge, <br/>\nout there with her walker, watering the collards and something else,  <br/>\ntomatoes, maybe.  The garden is gorgeous and lush, but she lives in Florida  so that <br/>\nhelps.  Aunt Susie dips snuff and chews tobacco.
