Two years ago, my Mom got her <br/>\nthe third grade level for Christmas. She didn&#39;t know what level to get for <br/>\nMoly. At first it was kind of hard for her, but now she just breezes through <br/>\nit. She wants me to find another level for her. In the game, you solve <br/>\npuzzles in Math, English, Spelling... to win the game. It is definitely on <br/>\nthe schoolish side, but I know Moly doesn&#39;t seem to mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48755,"nextTopicId":48764}}
