Not only did I have problems with MY systems, but the email provider was having problems as well.  All is well now, and I am back in business.  Hope you all didn&#39;t miss me TOO much on the lists lately!  hardy-har.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a little funny to start off my new email addy on the right foot.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE RED SHIRT.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong ago lived a brave sea Captain. He was<br/>\na manly man&#39;s man who showed no fear in facing his<br/>\nenemies. One day,while sailing the seven seas, a lookout<br/>\nspotted a pirate ship and the crew became frantic. The captain<br/>\nbellowed, &quot;Bring me my red shirt.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe First Mate quickly retrieved the captain&#39;s red shirt and <br/>\nwhile wearing the bright garb he led his mates into battle <br/>\nand defeated the pirates. <br/>\n<br/>\nLater on, the lookout spotted not one, but two pirate ships. The captain again howled for his red shirt, and so attired once again vanquished the pirates. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat evening, all the men sat around on the deck recounting the day&#39;s triumphs and one of the them asked the captain, &quot;Sir, why did you call for your red shirt before battle?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe captain replied &quot;If I am wounded in the attack, the shirt <br/>\nwill not show my blood, and thus, you men will continue to<br/>\nresist, unafraid.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the men sat in silence and marveled at the courage of <br/>\nsuch a man&#39;s manly man.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs dawn came the next morning, the lookout once again <br/>\nspotted not one, not two, but TEN pirate ships approaching. <br/>\nThe rank and file all stared in worshipful silence at the <br/>\ncaptain and waited for his usual reply.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe captain gazed with steely eyes upon the vast armada <br/>\narrayed against his mighty sailing ship and, without fear,<br/>\nturned, and calmly shouted:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Get me my brown pants.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/mail.html\">http://www.idahopagan.com/mail.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6793,"nextTopicId":6799}}
