I actually gave the children a choice of taking what I <br/>\nhad or taking their chances on the Dr. I hated doing that but I was sick of <br/>\nsickness and they were too.<br/>\n<br/>\nTriaminic cough and cold mixed with a bit of pepsi did the trick. They were <br/>\nable to get it down and keep it down and are all better after just one day <br/>\nof taking the stuff. Sierra had her first quiet coughless night last night <br/>\nwhich means I finally got some much needed sleep myself. I tried so hard <br/>\nwithout going to the meds but it just didn&#39;t work for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThankful for health again.<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50897,"nextTopicId":50925}}
