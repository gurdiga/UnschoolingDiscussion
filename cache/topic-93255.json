I moved a hose from the backyard faucet to avoid <br/>\nrunning water under Marty&#39;s window.  He&#39;s 15.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:45 I heard Kirby (17) get in the shower.  I knew he had to open the <br/>\nshop at 11:30.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was outside pulling weeds when I saw Kirby go downstairs in the house.  I <br/>\nwondered what he was doing because all his clothes are clean and put away in <br/>\nhis room, so he wasn&#39;t going to borrow socks from his dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe came around the side of the house with two Hansons sodas, which came from <br/>\nthe garage. He had them to take to work with him.  I asked him if the garage <br/>\ndoor was unplugged (which my husband sometimes does if he&#39;s working right near <br/>\nthe door).  <br/>\n<br/>\nKirby said, &quot;No, I just didn&#39;t want to open it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Is someone sleeping up there?&quot; (above the garage, I meant, thinking maybe <br/>\none of his gaming buddies stayed over)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No, but Marty&#39;s sick and Holly&#39;s still asleep.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWELL! <br/>\nWell cool.<br/>\nHe was just going along with my more-quiet-than-usual noise level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93086,"nextTopicId":93187}}
