I have six-year-old gifted <br/>\ndaughter, Kennedy and a four-year-old developmentally delayed <br/>\ndaughter, Victoria and I find that unschooling is perfect for both <br/>\nof them.  I love to watch them both spend the day doing things that <br/>\nare perfectly right for them, unaltered by someone else directing <br/>\ntheir time and energy.  Because they unschool, they are able to <br/>\nfocus on the things that interest them and learn about their own <br/>\nstrengths and talents rather than concerning themselves with what <br/>\neverybody else is doing and whether or not they exceed or fall below <br/>\nthe average expectancy.  Kennedy never has to worry about being <br/>\nbored with what is going in the classroom or having her creativity <br/>\nsquelched because she has to follow the approved classroom <br/>\nprocedures.  Victoria never has to experience feeling substandard or <br/>\nstupid because she isn&#39;t encountering developmental or academic <br/>\nmilestones at the same rate as other children her age.  I believe, <br/>\nas a result, they are and will be much happier children than if they <br/>\nwent to school.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71223,"nextTopicId":71370}}
