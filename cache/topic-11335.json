They are <br/>\nvery tame and docile and will sit in a child&#39;s lap contentedly while he <br/>\nwatches TV or is read to. We always leave the cage door open and haven&#39;t had <br/>\nany problems with escapes. They have a reputation for not biting... so far, <br/>\nours don&#39;t. They make cute squeaking noises and I think they&#39;re cute <br/>\ncritters. I found the chips sometimes used to line the cages to be <br/>\nexpensive, messy and smelly so I line the bottom of the cage with newspaper, <br/>\nwhich I roll up and change every day or two. I do the cleaning, and I remind <br/>\nmy 7yo to feed and play with his pets. But of course the responsibility is <br/>\nultimately mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you could take care of a friend&#39;s pet while they&#39;re on vacation <br/>\nfor a week or two it would give you a very good idea of how much work they <br/>\nare and how long your child&#39;s interest would last.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have a goldfish and a cat, and at the moment, a caterpillar on its <br/>\nway to being a butterfly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17857,"nextTopicId":17858}}
