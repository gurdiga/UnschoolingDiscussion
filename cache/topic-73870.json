He wasn&#39;t really being a bully <br/>\nthough, just being a little.. uhmm.&quot;too aggressive&quot; in sparring in karate.  <br/>\nHe kicked JP in the groin one time.. Then the next time he sparred with him, <br/>\nthe kid kicked his arm and left a whopper of a bruise.  They are supposed to <br/>\nhave a &quot;no contact&quot; rule when they are sparring, and I know they are bound to <br/>\noccasionally get carried away.  After all karate IS a contact sport.   But, those <br/>\ntwo incidents left JP not wanting to spar with this particular kid.  They are <br/>\nabout the same size, two of the smallest kids in the class ( actually, there <br/>\nis only one kid smaller than them)  And, I think that the kid is not afraid of <br/>\nreally going to town on JP because JP is not bigger than him.   At first I <br/>\ntold JP that I would mention it to Mr Wilson, but I really didnt want to make a <br/>\nbig deal out of it.  I know the kid&#39;s mom and she is very nice and I thought <br/>\nabout mentioning it to her.. But, instead, right before class when the kids <br/>\nwere just playing around, I just casually said to Zack,&quot;hey, buddy, take it easy <br/>\non JP today, you bout beat him up the last time you guys fought&quot;  ( kinda <br/>\ngrinning and good natured tone)  The kid grinned sheepishly at me and said &quot;&#39;OK!&quot;  <br/>\n  And that was that.     I have stayed for the whole class the last several <br/>\ntimes, and there has been no more &quot;overt&quot; sparring.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, there were some very rude kids at the pool at the Y the other day. They <br/>\nwere &quot;drop off&quot; kids.. no parents there.  And they kept splashing A LOT. So <br/>\nmuch that you just about got drowned every few seconds.  A few times I said.. <br/>\n&quot;hey, watch out guys, you&#39;redrowning us!&quot;  Then we would move out of their way.. <br/>\nBut, they kept on not paying attention and ending up splashing us over and <br/>\nover.   I kept reminding them that they were splashing us, but they really didnt <br/>\nseem to care.  Finally, I told the lifegaurd. &quot;Can you ask them to stop <br/>\nsplashing so much, we can&#39;t get away from them&quot;  He called them down and they let <br/>\nup for about 5 mins, then they were back to horseplay.   We were fed up by <br/>\nthen, so we just left that pool and went to the outdoor  pool.    In that <br/>\nsituation, there was really nothing else to do.. Luckily we did have an option, but it <br/>\nwas not our first choice.  The kids really wanted to stay indoors where the <br/>\nwater was much warmer.   But they didnt want to get a face full of water every <br/>\nfew seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\nWho has never dropped her kids off at the pool.   HEY, I like the pool myself <br/>\ntoo much to miss out!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132394532,"authorName":"Have A Nice Day!","from":"Have A Nice Day! &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"litlrooh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Our own bully version","postDate":"1055449338","msgId":73871,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2EwMWMzMzEyMCQ1Mjg3OWU4MCQ1YzU3NTI0NEBhby5sb3AuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMGMwMWMzMzExZCRiNGFhYTI0MCQ1YzU3NTI0NEBhby5sb3AuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":73870,"nextInTopic":73888,"prevInTime":73870,"nextInTime":73872,"topicId":73870,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thought I should clarify that the burning incident took place in town somewhere...not at my house.
