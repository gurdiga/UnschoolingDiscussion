She&#39;s 4 and when we were doing school-at-home all too often I would find her something to do while the boys and I got through lessons. I remember being grateful that she was able to play independently  of me. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has been more demanding since we began unschooling but it occurred to me today that she is making up for all the times I had no time for her and I&#39;m extremely thankful that she wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a great day together today. We looked around the garden for  flowers and anthills and played catch and I pushed her on the swing for ages. She helped me cook and do dishes, the we played with stuff at the sink to see what would float and wouldn&#39;t. It was fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70666,"nextTopicId":70826}}
