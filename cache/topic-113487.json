Probably way more candy than the average household.  My nephew who is 10 always takes a gallon ziploc home filled to the brim with candy he finds around at my house.  My children (now grown) were always allowed candy and it more often than not got tossed months after Halloween, Easter, any big candy event.  Fast forward to raising grandchildren.  Three girls, the oldest two are 4 and the youngest is 17 months.  They&#39;ve all had candy.  They all like candy.  The baby is kind love crazy with the candy, but it&#39;s still new to her of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nValentines Day just came.  Their Granddaddy gave each little girl a half pound box of minature chocolates (about half the normal size of a boxed chocolate).  I let each girl open theres and I opened the baby&#39;s for her and let her choose.  She dug in with both hands, stuffing her little cheeks with chocolates, nodding her head in approval and delight.  The big girls ate two pieces each and closed up their heart boxes.  Anna stood in front of hers with chocolate spilling out the edges of her mouth and having a wonderful time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHer mom later asked me how much I &quot;let&quot; Anna eat.   I told her she probably ate slightly less than half of the half pound box.  She demanded I check and see how much see actually ate (thinking it was much more than that since I just gave her the box).  Anna, the 17 month old crazy lover of candy had eaten FOUR PIECES before she was done for the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are nearly a week out from Valentines Day, we still have plenty of chocolate left in ther boxes.  A couple days Anna has wanted her box and ate a couple chocolates and then walked away.  They know it will be there when they want it, they don&#39;t have to eat it uncontrollably until it&#39;s all gone and then wish for more.  It&#39;s just a part of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had children who&#39;ve come to parties unattended who ate and ate and ate candy/sweets until they did actually throw up.  I&#39;ve been chidded by parents for &quot;letting&quot; them eat that much.  I don&#39;t know at what point I should demand they stop really.  I&#39;ve never had to do that with my own children or my granddaughters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think like anything, if it&#39;s readily available children can and will set their own limits.  I also don&#39;t experience that hyper, craziness that some claim their children exibit when they have anything with sugar.  Maybe those children are just giddy/hyper with delight that they&#39;ve finally gotten some of the forbidden sugar instead of a real chemical reaction in their bodies?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just trying to say it WILL work, your child will NOT eat only sweets the rest of their lives if you let them.  If you try to control those things, they will want them more than ever it seems by the children I&#39;ve seen who don&#39;t get sugar or have it rationed to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: julesmiel &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:julesmiel@...\">julesmiel@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sat, Feb 19, 2011 4:57 am<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Battle with candy...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHi, parent of two here, ages 5 & 2, craving some unschooling discussion after a computer hiatus. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Adam Dealan-de &lt;adam@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I just don&#39;t feel comfortable giving as much candy to my children aged 2 and 4 as they desire.

My brother was quite ill and his special diet (which included daily cod liver oil) was given to me as well.   The only time I had access to sweets was when I performed, or went to concerts and there was a reception.  I was also the only kid there who had their plate overflowing with everything and anything I could put on it.  Often at my house I would find empty candy wrappers and ice cream containers which I was told (by my mother) were from long agoshe &quot;didn&#39;t know how they got there.&quot;  Years later I found that she too had had a constricted diet and hid the food she ate from us. <br/>\nJump forward to this last Halloween and the party my children attended the day before (all of us attended).  When we walked through the door the first thing I noticed was the cake, pizza, and chocolate everywhere.  So apparently did many of the other kids who came through the door (we belong to one group which is unschooled/homeschooleddifference mainly being restrictions on bedtimes, food, TV. etc.)  My kids (who have had free access to food since they were born), said &quot;no mom we don&#39;t want that, we want to play,&quot; despite the fact they had just been complaining about hunger 30 seconds earlier in the car.  I sat and watched while other kids were made to eat a certain number of pieces of pizza, or vegetables before they could have the cake, or chocolate.  (as if pizza is any better really!).  Finally about two hours into the party, my eldest ( 5 1/2 ) ran over and asked for food.  What he chose to eat was a large plate of tomatoes and snap peas.  Parents asked me how I got him to do this   (I am thinking maybe they didn&#39;t notice that my youngest (4)had already eaten a few chocolate ghouls without me getting upset...)<br/>\nMy point is, my children have had a lot of exposure to many foods.  They have foods they like, and those they do not like.  I have never forced them into trying a food they were not interested in trying.  I would not want someone forcing me to try something I thought looked disgusting. Even though we now have a large shopping bag full of candy from trick or treating they are not diving into it (like I would have) as if it is the best thing in the world.  It is just another part of food.  Not more important.  I think allowing them to make their own food choices has been the best thing I could have done for them because they will not have the baggage that I did (and my mom) attached to it.  <br/>\nOhafter the piñata broke the kids helped gather the candy but refused to take any home because they said they didn&#39;t need any.

It a decision to really take  <br/>\nthe fear out and examine it to see if the &quot;facts&quot; support what really  <br/>\nhappens in unschooling homes.

It&#39;s a small moment in a life. It&#39;s a good time, it&#39;s a <br/>\nglorious day, but it doesn&#39;t fundamentally change someone&#39;s experience with the <br/>\nworld. Or, at least not usually. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was early to unschooling the food idea really was a hard one to get my <br/>\nmind around. I&#39;d trusted the idea that humans were hunter-gatherers who focussed <br/>\non fats and sugars as rare good foods for so long that it was hard to see that <br/>\nit was a point that could be debated. There was a mom on Always Learning who was <br/>\ntesting it out. She had a boy who liked ice cream a lot. Rather than put ice <br/>\ncream in front of him and say go for it, she started saying yes to his requests. <br/>\nSo, he had ice cream for breakfast, and  then ice cream again, and then some <br/>\nmore ice cream. She wrote about having to get a coat on and go out to the <br/>\nfreezer in the garage to get more ice cream. But she kept writing about it. And <br/>\nover the course of a few days his enjoyment of each succeeding bowl of ice cream <br/>\nbegan to wane. <br/>\n<br/>\nI waited for each instalment. I talked to David. I was fascinated by the idea. <br/>\nWe decided to say yes more. To move slowly, but inexorably, toward a home where <br/>\nfood choice was the norm. There was a day when it seemed all Simon ate was <br/>\ndoughnuts. There were days when I found myself counting the bags of cheese puffs <br/>\n(small, single serving bags are the norm in the UK) that Linnaea ate. When I <br/>\nfound myself fretting more, growing more nervous I would keep a food diary. Not <br/>\npublicly, not &quot;let&#39;s see what we are eating&quot;, but quietly, just writing down <br/>\nwhat Simon and Linnaea and I were eating over the course of a week or two or <br/>\nthree. Each time I found that what may have looked like a day of bingeing was a <br/>\nsmall part of a bigger picture of balance. A day of doughnuts was followed by a <br/>\nweek without doughnuts. It really made a difference to step back and see more <br/>\nforest and fewer individual trees. It also helped me to offer more food to them. <br/>\nInstead of being passive in my role as caregiver, bringing them platters of <br/>\nfood, making sure that bags of cheese puffs weren&#39;t the only easy to grab food <br/>\nin the house, making sure that their choice wasn&#39;t just about what they could <br/>\ngrab easily, what would sustain them without pulling them away from what they <br/>\nwere doing. Or, if it was about what they could grab the most easily, making <br/>\nsure that there were lots of easy to grab options. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also really important to remember that there are different food <br/>\nrequirements for growth and development than there are for maintenance and <br/>\nrepair. So, just as a pregnant woman has very different dietary requirements <br/>\nthan a pre-pregnancy woman, so a young child does to an adult. Brain growth <br/>\nthrives on fats and sugars. The difference between breastmilk for a newborn and <br/>\nfor a toddler can demonstrate that pretty quickly. It isn&#39;t just because a <br/>\nnewborn is deriving all of his or her calories from breastmilk, it is also <br/>\nbecause they are still developing so much, so quickly. The growth rate is so <br/>\nsteep. What may feel like a very healthy diet to you, what may help you to feel <br/>\nbetter and more focussed, may be absolutely sub-par for your young children. It <br/>\nmay help to think about the foods that tasted really good to you as a child and <br/>\nhow much less good they taste to you now. And that isn&#39;t simply because children <br/>\nhave more taste buds than adults. Although that does go some way to explaining <br/>\nwhy bitter foods like spinach aren&#39;t always well loved by young children, <br/>\nalthough Linnaea and Simon both really liked and like it. Simon used to eat <br/>\nbowls of raw spinach. Your change in taste and preference is about what you need <br/>\nto thrive. It has changed. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne last idea. Simon and Linnaea have a relationship with food that is <br/>\ncompletely different to mine. I&#39;m getting there, but I still have a few hang <br/>\nups. They eat what they enjoy without worrying about the emotional aspect of the <br/>\nfood. We went trick or treating on Halloween. Simon didn&#39;t want to get the <br/>\ncandy, so he just walked the route. Linnaea wanted the whole experience and we <br/>\nwalked maybe 3 miles or so in a little town and she got a small bag of <br/>\ngoodies--the UK just isn&#39;t trick or treating ready. I think she&#39;s eaten 3 or 4 <br/>\nthings from the bag. And that was on the first night. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s even <br/>\nopened it since. I, on the other hand, would have eaten everything within a day <br/>\nor two and then tried to find where my brother had hidden his stash. I used to <br/>\nsit on the floor and pick all the marshmallows out of Lucky Charms cereal. Or <br/>\nlive off of poptarts, or eat all the candy I was supposed to sell for a <br/>\nschool fund-raiser and have to buy it out of my paper route money. Food isn&#39;t <br/>\nabout the limits and loading and emotions. Food is what you are hungry for, what <br/>\nyou enjoy. Most often Simon or Linnaea ask for things like risotto or phat Thai <br/>\nor samosas or ham sandwiches. They don&#39;t tend to ask for sweet things. Although <br/>\nthey did come up to bed last night very keen to get supplies in so that they <br/>\ncould bake pies. They want pears and raspberries and cherries and apples and <br/>\nwhip cream and they want root beer floats to accompany. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Adam Dealan-de &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:adam@...\">adam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, 2 November, 2010 21:25:54<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Battle with  candy...<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nHere is my situation.
