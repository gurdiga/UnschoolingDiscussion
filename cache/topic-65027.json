Interesting...I met a woman, 23 yo who is pregnant. Her ILs<br/>\nwere attachment parenting folks, her MIL was a LLL leader. She says that she is<br/>\nresearching everything and that they have some doubts about AP (family bed etc).<br/>\nMainly because her dh remembers being very upset when he started kindergarten.<br/>\nHe cried and his mother stayed with him for the first couple of days and then <br/>\npulled him out and kept him home for another year. He feels that he was sheltered<br/>\nand that he should have been able to handle kindergarten at age 5 like the other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was able to talk with her about different kids having different personalities and<br/>\nhow it might have actually been *worse* for him if his mother had not been so <br/>\nresponsive to his needs. Was able to use my kids as an example (we did not start<br/>\nthe fb with my oldest until he was 1 year, he was in day care p/t until he was 2,<br/>\nthe youngest has never been to day care, slept with us from day 1 and definitely<br/>\nhas led a more &quot;child-led&quot; life) Jason (my oldest) is definitely more cautious, <br/>\nmore shy, more mommy centered. Kyle is my little independent guy. These are just<br/>\ntheir personalities. I do not take credit/blame for creating them...this does not<br/>\nmean that I do not have any influence on them, but I do believe that their fundamental<br/>\npersonality types were there when they were born. <br/>\n<br/>\nI basically told her that there were tons of different ways to parent and that she <br/>\nbasically had to follow her heart and do what felt right to her for her child. That<br/>\nthere was no &quot;right&quot; way to parent and that her child would help  her learn more<br/>\nthen any &quot;expert&quot;. She has already found a LLL group that she really likes and her<br/>\nMIL has given her great reading material. I just felt a little sad that it was her<br/>\ndh that was causing her to question it when he was the one raised that way. I did <br/>\nnot get the impression that he was opposed to it, just that he had some concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know that as the mom to 2 boys (and no more kids expected...dh was snipped last<br/>\nweek) I am hoping for wonderful DILs. And hoping that my boys don&#39;t regret how they<br/>\nwere raised. It doesn&#39;t seem like they will and I hope to keep talking about *why* I<br/>\nparent the way I do. Maybe that will make the difference...I know that when I was a <br/>\nkid, parenting was something that my parents just did...it was not something that <br/>\nwas really discussed with us....<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.

He has NONE of the desperation and pressure to have a <br/>\ngirlfriend that he would have if he were in school.  He has had a few, and is <br/>\nstill friends with them after.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSunday he told his current girlfriend (who goes to Manzano High, for the <br/>\nlocals and ex-New-Mexicans) that he didn&#39;t want to go to the prom.  She fell <br/>\ninto dramatic mode.  Sent a friend over to tell him she was crying and to <br/>\ncome talk to her.   (At a big public park full of people there for an SCA <br/>\nfighter practice.)   He said no, she should come back over here and talk!  <br/>\nShe sent another friend.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe was doing something that to me was FULLY understandable and <br/>\nrecognizeable, from a high school girl point of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo Kirby it was bizarre and irrational behavior like they won&#39;t even put into <br/>\na sit com.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s right!!  Good for him!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople trust him with their kids.  A stranger trusted him with a baby for an <br/>\nhour.
