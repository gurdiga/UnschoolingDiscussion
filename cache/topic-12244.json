Its so easy to forget what your own <br/>\ndreams are when you spend so much time doing for every one else.The book <br/>\nSimple Abundance is good for this stuff-it really inspired me. When I was <br/>\npregnant with Jenny I made a list of all these things I wanted to do while I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t working as much, but I bet I haven&#39;t done any of them in 3 years. I <br/>\ndo remember that learning to play the piano was one of them, and I just got <br/>\none, so that is pretty likely to happen now! I think I will make another <br/>\nlist.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe we should both make one, and then we can support each other to stay <br/>\nwith it, and to take the time for ourselves to find our own passions.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathie<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"braunville@aol.com","from":"braunville@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"3scJMatJel2ihwzroNA5G72DBn-nThhn6AbTu5RSRECXUyfr9lhmNGmwwIEi5xXBr8GHuyHU8fhG","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] just relax","postDate":"967516859","msgId":12244,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZkLjhhN2NkZGEuMjZkYzdjYmJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12258,"prevInTime":12243,"nextInTime":12245,"topicId":12244,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/28/2000 7:23:25 PM Pacific Daylight Time, ... thank ...
