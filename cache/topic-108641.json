When people&#39;s own thinking and <br/>\nwriting is muddly, or they&#39;re asking for simple answer (rules to follow) instead of <br/>\nunravelling all the threads of their internal messages and assumptions, <br/>\nthey&#39;re not moving toward unschooling as well as they could if they sort through <br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking about these things as I&#39;m adding to my notes for talks at <br/>\nthe Live and Learn conference, and thinking about cranky detractors of other <br/>\nyears (gone on to other lists, to avoid people who might persist about their <br/>\nmental processes) who have stated very simply and unilaterally and that there is <br/>\nnothing to unschooling past just not using a curriculum.   It is no more and <br/>\nno less than not using a curriculum.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just too simple, and not workable, and the absence of a curriculum in <br/>\nthe presence of a momload of school thinking and fears and false &quot;truths&quot; is <br/>\nnot going to create a rich learning environment.   People unwilling to consider <br/>\nthat are on their way to reverting to a curriculum or putting their kids in <br/>\nschool, or settling for a half-assed situation of one sort or another.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108610,"nextTopicId":108070}}
