I was an only and I have an only (not<br/>\nnecessarily by choice). It is not so easy as most people think, yet I do<br/>\nunderstand the challenges of having more than one (sibling fights, time for<br/>\neveryone, etc.). The days I so wish we had more children are field trip<br/>\ndays and family vacations (my son loves to go places with other kids), days<br/>\nwhen I need to clean house (he spends a lot of time alone those days), and<br/>\ndays when other kids are just not available to play (harder when<br/>\nhomeschooling because I have to actively search for potential playmates and<br/>\narrange playdates around the schedules of others). I have found that,<br/>\nbecause I have only one, people assume that I will be able to arrange<br/>\nevents and make accommodations because I &quot;have so much free time&quot; (not<br/>\nnecessarily true!). Although I have spent a lot of time being his main<br/>\nplaymate in the past, as he has gotten older, I am not as much fun for him<br/>\nas kids his age it seems. Now he really asks for other kids to play with<br/>\nand this is a challenge for me to find them. On the other hand, with one<br/>\nwho is older (now 7), the packing for trips is a lot easier, we are more<br/>\nmobile, and we are free to do things like bicycling and play tennis without<br/>\nhaving to supervise younger siblings. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it is important to remember that all sizes of families have their<br/>\nchallenges and rewards.<br/>\n<br/>\nOlivia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Message: 12<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Fri, 21 Jul 2000 18:02:01 -0400<br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;aworthen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aworthen@...\">aworthen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: fed-up...Tracy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was an only and I have friends that have onlys and it&#39;s far more demanding<br/>\n&gt;than you think. You are the main source of entertainment for the child. I<br/>\n&gt;remember when my second became old enough to interact with my first. I felt<br/>\n&gt;like a new person. They we&#39;re playing with each other and I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;constantly have to be entertaining her. I know moms of onlys that spend all<br/>\n&gt;their time on the phone planning their kid&#39;s days.
