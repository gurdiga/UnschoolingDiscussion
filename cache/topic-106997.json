My middle son (10) seems to be going through this right <br/>\nnow.  I&#39;m not at all worried about how things will turn out in the <br/>\nend- I couldn&#39;t be more proud of my children or more confident about <br/>\nthe future.  But I *am* a little concerned about getting through <br/>\nawkward moments in the meantime.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example... one thing that all three of my boys, but my 10yo in <br/>\nparticular, would be considered &quot;behind&quot; in is <br/>\nhandwriting/spelling.  I hesitate to use that word, even in quotes, <br/>\nbut sometimes it&#39;s unexpectedly glaring.  For example... he was sick <br/>\nwith chicken pox not long ago, and his dear schooled friend from <br/>\ndown the street, knowing my son was cooped up and itchy, came over <br/>\nwith Mad Libs to cheer him up.  Mad Libs are nothing new here, but <br/>\nwhen we&#39;re playing amongst ourselves I generally do the writing, <br/>\nwhich is the way my kids prefer it.  When they *do* write they <br/>\nalmost always ask me how to spell the words.  Anyway, when our <br/>\nlittle friend (9) was doing the writing and my son was choosing the <br/>\nwords, the friend dashed the words off quickly and effortlessly.  I <br/>\ncould see the tension in my son&#39;s face because he knew what was <br/>\ncoming was &quot;now you write for me,&quot; and those obvious comparisons <br/>\n(even if they&#39;re just in his own mind) make him uncomfortable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo my son&#39;s relief, I suggested doing the writing myself so that <br/>\nboth boys could come up with funny words together.  But lately he&#39;s <br/>\nspending more and more time going off with other families and doing <br/>\nsleepovers and such, and I won&#39;t always be there to &quot;cover&quot; for him <br/>\nthis way.  Similar situations have happened with reading as he&#39;s not <br/>\nyet fluent and virtually all of his schooled friends are, even those <br/>\nconsiderably younger than him.  The worst part is that *he* feels <br/>\ninferior when these situations come up, despite the fact that he&#39;s <br/>\ngot all sorts of knowledge and experience and perspective that <br/>\nothers his age don&#39;t have, and he knows it, and I know it, and we&#39;ve <br/>\ntalked about it all before.   I honestly never expected my <br/>\nunschooled son to care so deeply about such comparisons, and I&#39;m <br/>\ntrying to strike a balance between wanting him to *not* care about <br/>\nwhat others think and at the same time wanting to honor and validate <br/>\nhis feelings whatever they are. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt also bothers me on some level that there are many people in our <br/>\nlives who would jump on such &quot;evidence&quot; (seen through their school <br/>\nglasses) to conclude that our unconventional choices don&#39;t &quot;work.&quot;<br/>\nI know that the answer, both for my son and vicariously for me, is <br/>\npatience and clarity.  It&#39;s just hard sometimes, this hump...<br/>\nat least when it comes to Mad Libs and such.  It&#39;s so much easier to <br/>\nsee the bigger picture when he&#39;s playing his guitar, or surfing, or <br/>\ndoing one of the many other things that make him gloriously himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatti</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106998,"nextTopicId":107006}}
