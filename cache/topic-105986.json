(Or way... do I DISagree?  &quot;with Kelly, I  disagree&quot;?)<br/>\n <br/>\nPeople who ground their kids and make them work all the time they&#39;re not  <br/>\n&quot;doing schoolwork&quot; and who spank them think they&#39;re being loving and  sensible.  <br/>\nI question the &quot;thoughtful,&quot; but they would say thoughtful,  probably.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nTheir results are not better.  They gamble their relationship with the  child <br/>\nand often lose it, and their results are not better than mine, which to  them <br/>\nwould SURELY look neglectful.  The other night my teenaged boys both  got <br/>\nback really (really) late, Marty (16) at 3:00 or so (he was outside talking  to <br/>\nhis friends, both also homeschoolers and came in at 3:00) and Kirby closer to  <br/>\n5:00 a.m.   I was up because I couldn&#39;t sleep.  I wasn&#39;t afraid  or angry.  <br/>\nThey hadn&#39;t been doing anything wrong, illegal or  dangerous.  They were with <br/>\npeople we know and were in safe places.   Marty and his friends had gone to the <br/>\nrock house (a little hike in the mountains  here) and Kirby was at a friend&#39;s <br/>\nhouse after the gaming shop closed.  They  had watched a movie and then played <br/>\na game, and it kept getting later.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI could have had a bedtime and a curfew.  <br/>\nIf the principle is to know where kids are and to know they&#39;re safe,  though, <br/>\nI have that.  And right now Kirby is in his room playing an XBox  game with <br/>\nhis friend Joey (who paid for the game but doesn&#39;t own an XBox.   Marty is at <br/>\nwork and will be home in an hour or so.  Holly is asleep in  Charmouth, in <br/>\nsouthern England, but I talked to her for nearly an hour earlier  today.<br/>\n <br/>\nLiving without rules, living by principle, can look neglectful to those who  <br/>\nhave been told and are passing on the &quot;truths&quot; to their kids, that rules keep  <br/>\npeople safe and happy.  That&#39;s not true.  Marty did well at a junior  police <br/>\nacademy summer before last.  One of the instructors was GUSHING to  me about <br/>\nhow much they admired and enjoyed Marty.  He said you could always  tell when a <br/>\nkid comes from a home with a lot of rules and discipline.<br/>\n <br/>\nNo, he couldn&#39;t.<br/>\nHe was unable to recognize (or even to imagine, I bet) that something that  <br/>\nimpressive could be the product of no rules, no discipline, but living by  <br/>\nprinciples, as directly and lovingly together as we could.   Being  with them, <br/>\nmore BEing than &quot;with.&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Observing chaos was Hello-respectfully here:)","postDate":"1116536294","msgId":106002,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIxMC4xMjIzMzA4LjJmYmU1N2U2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":106001,"nextInTopic":106003,"prevInTime":106001,"nextInTime":106003,"topicId":105986,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/19/2005 2:24:06 PM Mountain Daylight Time, homegrownkidz@yahoo.com writes: Describing unschooling from now on, from YOUR point of view,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-427776179\">In a message dated 5/19/2005 2:24:06 PM Mountain Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:homegrownkidz@...\">homegrownkidz@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nDescribing &quot;unschooling&quot; from now on, from YOUR point of view, will  <br/>\nsurely help many people<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===========<br/>\n <br/>\nIt might help those lax-to-neglectful families you know, too, if you ask  <br/>\nthem why they&#39;re not being with their kids more, getting out more, having more  <br/>\nfun stuff to do at home.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Observing chaos was Hello-respectfully here:)","postDate":"1116536096","msgId":106001,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDNzJBQ0MyNUE0QzYyQy1ERTAtMkNFQUJATUJMSy1NMjIuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGQ2aWVkditiYzU5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":106000,"nextInTopic":106002,"prevInTime":106000,"nextInTime":106002,"topicId":105986,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They will often describe<br/>\nthemselves as &quot;taking an unschooling approach&quot;. However, in contrast to<br/>\ntheir lives resembling chaos, the reason I personally do not consider that<br/>\nthey are actually living an unschooling life is because of their very<br/>\nclearly expressed educational/time structures and varyingly authoritarian<br/>\nparenting approaches. Lots of &quot;limits&quot; enforced. This includes things like<br/>\n&quot;we only do our curriculum in the mornings&quot; and &quot;I insist she keep her hair<br/>\ncut short because she wouldn&#39;t brush it often enough&quot;, let alone &quot;We got rid<br/>\nof our tv because my daughter wanted to watch it too much&quot;. Basically no<br/>\nevidence of the chaotic *appearance* that freedom can create!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat leads an observer to judge that children in another family are in need<br/>\nof boundaries and structure? What criteria does one use to say &quot;obviously&quot;?<br/>\nIs it behavior or how they treat each other or ways of speaking or physical<br/>\nappearance or prioritizing with time or kids crying or kids wanting to spend<br/>\ntime away from their own homes or...what? I don&#39;t see families with children<br/>\nbegging for limits or rules (as far as I know), so I&#39;m not sure how to<br/>\nrecognize that. (Could be a paradox here...)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am absolutely sure that many a casual observer would consider our RU life<br/>\none of utter chaos - certainly the state of our too-small-for-our-stuff<br/>\napartment could give that impression. I am privately convinced that several<br/>\nof the members of my local h/s group consider Jayn in need of &quot;boundaries&quot;<br/>\nsimply because I don&#39;t insist that she brush her hair, let alone the fact<br/>\nthat we never do anything remotely resembling a lesson. Some have expressed<br/>\ntheir expectation that I will change my ideas (deeply held convictions)<br/>\nabout schooling and magically become more controlling by the time Jayn gets<br/>\nto be &quot;in 8th grade&quot;, displaying only their own lack of understanding of how<br/>\nRU works. Some would consider our life chaotic because of our rotating sleep<br/>\nschedule. People are constantly saying to me &quot;I don&#39;t know how you do it&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy priority is facilitating Jayn&#39;s general happiness. Not her personal<br/>\ndevelopment or her education or her ability to make a success of her adult<br/>\nlife. All these things will happen perfectly well without being my first<br/>\nfocus. The occasions when her physical safety or health and her immediate<br/>\nhappiness are opposing are extremely rare. The occasions where her happiness<br/>\nopposes the comfort or happiness of another person are also rare, and at<br/>\nthose times we work it out as needed. I just want her to enjoy her life -<br/>\nher family, activities, friends, increasing competences and broadening<br/>\nskills.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people would define chaos as the absence of a plan, and I know there<br/>\nare Unschooling kids who find knowing the plan for the day essential to<br/>\ntheir comfort and security. My experience with Jayn is that plans beyond the<br/>\nimmediate future or very broad or general (eg: Tuesday is dance class day<br/>\nand then we&#39;ll probably go to the park until whenever tbd; Thursday is<br/>\nlaundry day unless something cool comes up) often collapse. The dissolution<br/>\nof a plan is more painful if I have become attached to it or to my desired<br/>\noutcome. You know: &quot;The best laid plans of mice and men....&quot; Can this appear<br/>\nchaotic to outsiders? I bet it does.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Jayn and I, it is less stressful to say we value flexibility,<br/>\nspontaneity and improvisation - and practice Acceptance - rather than<br/>\nexpress it negatively as &quot;being disorganized&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
