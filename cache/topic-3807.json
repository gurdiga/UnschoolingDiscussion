My<br/>\nexperience with folks around here is shy is something they are not - rather<br/>\nthey tend to be a bit more on the judgemental side.  That is something that<br/>\nreally bothers me.  I love my support group because they are accepting of<br/>\nfolks from all walks of life, all religions or not, and all hsing styles.<br/>\nSo when I run into folks that think that school at home is the only sound<br/>\nmorale, spiritual way to go it really steams me up.  I&#39;ve run into several<br/>\nlike that.  I am probably more judgemental than I think at times as well.<br/>\nI don&#39;t mean to be but some can be so negative about my choices that I can<br/>\nfall into defending myself and my choices to them if I&#39;m not careful.<br/>\n<br/>\n but i also don&#39;t want to miss sharing the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;wonderful world of unschooling with someone who might be &quot;dying&quot; in their <br/>\n&gt;chosen structure.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t want to miss this either.  I was actually going to have a new hser<br/>\nover tomorrow to discuss just this - how to overcome the drudgery of the<br/>\nworkbook/school at home approach.  Although I don&#39;t claim to be an<br/>\nunschooling expert (far from it!) I do know many resources to contact (like<br/>\nthis list) and can share the new things I&#39;ve learned to do.  Unfortunately,<br/>\nI will not be able to do this as I had to admit my dh into the hospital<br/>\nthis evening.  I will most probably disappear here on the list for a few<br/>\nmore days.  Sigh.  :o(  DH will be fine, just needs some tests that will<br/>\nput us in touch with the right drugs he needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n i have heard the same <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;comments as you have... but i wonder, if the unschoolers we meet are few and <br/>\n&gt;far between, who have they met?  perhaps no-one.  we can be the first <br/>\n&gt;unschoolers that they come to know and it might eventually give it a good <br/>\n&gt;name in their eyes! <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Erin I think you have it right - either no one or someone that just rubbed<br/>\nthem the wrong way in the first place.  So many SAHers are part of support<br/>\ngroups that simply denounce unschooling as being anything but hsing.  And<br/>\nmany of these people don&#39;t have a clue what unschooling actually is.  Met<br/>\none the other day that basically unschooled through 4th grade and then<br/>\nSAH&#39;d the rest of the way (her son is now 17) and she really doesn&#39;t even<br/>\nrealize that is what she did!  I think she would be offended if I told her<br/>\nshe was an unschooler to start off with.  :-P  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, like I said I&#39;m going to disappear for a day or two more - I soon<br/>\nhope to be back in the groove of keeping up with my email lists - sorry for<br/>\npopping in and out so.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great week!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn His Service,<br/>\n<br/>\nLaraine<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:praxis@...\">praxis@...</a> <br/>\nSubscribe to Our Prairie Primer Today Community at:<br/>\n             <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/PrairiePrimerToday\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/PrairiePrimerToday</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"MORELFAM@xxx.xxx","from":"MORELFAM@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"u86BIcSJS54qplLyknWzacUSK7JbD6NynaiRUZxCuNRBkGtJeGCD_uSsL8ZwXtwhvhIiAWQJsg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: unschooling criticism","postDate":"939851859","msgId":3807,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yNTMuMzgwNy45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3980,"prevInTime":3806,"nextInTime":3808,"topicId":3807,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/12/99 11:44:46 PM, praxis@nextek.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1695223463\">In a message dated 10/12/99 11:44:46 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:praxis@...\">praxis@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve never known people here in Ohio to be shy about<br/>\nwhat they think is right and wrong - myself included when I&#39;m being honest<br/>\nabout it. :o) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nok, does this mean you have found a way to positively explain your hsing <br/>\nstyle?  it always depends on who i am talking to, how i edit what i say!  but <br/>\ni lean heavily on the philosophy end of things, for that is from where i make <br/>\nthese decisions anyway.  i never thought of it as shy so much as avoiding <br/>\ndiscomfort for myself and others!  but i also dont want to miss sharing the <br/>\nwonderful world of unschooling with someone who might be &quot;dying&quot; in their <br/>\nchosen structure.  i know it is my freedom to choose to share or not, i guess <br/>\ni just need to keep building my confidence and realize nothing is perfect and <br/>\nnot worry about giving homeschooling a bad name!  i have heard the same <br/>\ncomments as you have... but i wonder, if the unschoolers we meet are few and <br/>\nfar between, who have they met?  perhaps no-one.  we can be the first <br/>\nunschoolers that they come to know and it might eventually give it a good <br/>\nname in their eyes! <br/>\n<br/>\nerin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3951,"nextTopicId":3988}}
