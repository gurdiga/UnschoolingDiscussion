I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know Sierra, other than the little I&#39;ve read, but she sounds so <br/>\nmuch like my son I just had to let you know. We went through very <br/>\nsimilar baffling episodes before he was finally diagnosed with <br/>\nAspergers Syndrome. He&#39;s so mildly affected, it was not easy to pick <br/>\nup, but now that I know about it, I can understand him so well now <br/>\nand life is peaceful again. Just a thought. Hopefully, it&#39;s just a <br/>\nphase for her. Best of luck. Beth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61173,"nextTopicId":61206}}
