I consider it my role as <br/>\nthe parent who wants these things to happen and to unfold really well to create <br/>\na nest, and environment, in which learning happens easily, children can get <br/>\nalong with each other or get away from each other, choices are varied and <br/>\nworkable, there is safety to come home to any hour of the day, and there are <br/>\nopportunities for various combinations of people (Holly really likes to be with <br/>\nMarty lately; Keith sometimes wants to find good reasons to spend time with Kirby, <br/>\netc.).   There needs to be a variety of good and interesting food.   Clothes <br/>\nand towels need to be clean.   If I want kids to keep taking baths because <br/>\nthey want to, soap, shampoo and conditioner need to be readily available.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI know from personal experience LOTS of ways to create an edgy, <br/>\ninsecure-feeling environment.   I could drink a lot, only buy toilet paper when it runs <br/>\nout, not feed the dog but just yell at kids if the dogfood dish was empty, give <br/>\naway or throw away kids&#39; clothes I didn&#39;t like, throw away any odd puzzle or <br/>\ngame pieces I came across, not tell people where I was going or when I&#39;d be <br/>\nback, play music loudly if it&#39;s something I like that others don&#39;t like...    Oh I <br/>\ncould go on, but having that checklist inside me keeps me alert to who to be. <br/>\n   And so I don&#39;t drink a lot, I get toilet paper before we&#39;re out, I keep <br/>\nthe dog fed (and others help willingly), I never throw things away without <br/>\nasking, I try to keep games and puzzles intact, I am considerate about movies and <br/>\nmusic and leave a note if I&#39;m going somewhere (or tell people, if they&#39;re awake <br/>\nand home).    I learned those things from knowing what it feels like to wish <br/>\nI had them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to give my children what I wish I had had, or at least I offer it.   I <br/>\ntry to do for them what I was glad people did for me when I was growing up.   <br/>\nI watch them for clues, needs, desires, curiosities, interests, and I feather <br/>\nthe next with what they seem to lack.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen there&#39;s a disagreement about something, not only does each child learn a <br/>\nlittle (or a lot) about how to avoid it in the future, but I also learn what <br/>\nI could do to help them have more space or opportunity to avoid such <br/>\nfrustrations &quot;next time&quot; (preventing many &quot;next times&quot; as we go).<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose to live with my husband.   I chose to have children.    Holly didn&#39;t <br/>\nchoose to live with Kirby.   Kirby didn&#39;t choose to live with Marty.    They <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to maintain a relationship for the rest of their lives.   I think <br/>\nthey will choose to do so, but they don&#39;t have the legal or social obligation I <br/>\nhave to Keith and that I have to each of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107522,"nextTopicId":107475}}
