I have 2 girls (ages 9 & 10) and we&#39;ve unschooled for a year.  I&#39;ve worked at home most of their lives.  They did go to school for a few years (my own ignorance), but then I learned about the wonderful world of homeschooling, then unschooling, and we&#39;re loving it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;d just like to connect with anyone else in a similar position, if possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nJoanne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50907,"nextTopicId":50930}}
