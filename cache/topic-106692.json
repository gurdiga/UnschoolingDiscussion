One day my kids were playing at the park with some other kids they had never met before.   One of the other kids, an older girl of about 9, asked Drew (7) what school he goes to.  Drew said, &quot;I&#39;m homeschooled&quot;, (which is his standard response to people who wouldn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; unschooling).  The girl said, with a knowing smirk on her face, &quot;Oh.  You must be spoiled.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nJennifer F.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well-behaved women rarely make history.&quot;  -Laurel T.
