I&#39;m going to try the<br/>\nupside-down and <br/>\nbackwards notebook idea and look for lefthanded notebooks too.***<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is left handed and went to public school.  He did a lot of<br/>\nwriting practice, penmanship, etc.  <br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t like to write.  Not only is the binding of notebooks a problem<br/>\nbut we write from left to right and a left handed person&#39;s hand trails<br/>\nthrough the ink and can smear it.   I think that&#39;s the reason a lot of<br/>\nleft handed people bend their wrist and write with their hand curving<br/>\nover the top of the line - it tends to keep their hand off the paper and<br/>\nout of the ink. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe your son could write from right to left?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if it comforts you, writing practice didn&#39;t make my husband a better<br/>\nwriter.  He did write long love letters to me before we were married so<br/>\nhe can write when he wants to. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not left handed but my bird list is on a small, postcard size, sketch<br/>\npad and I use it with the spiral binding on the top instead of the left. <br/>\nIt&#39;s much easier to write in that way because your hand can support more<br/>\nof the book as you write while standing or crouching.  There&#39;s room for<br/>\nquick sketches too.  It fits in most vest or coat pockets and the easy<br/>\npouches of front or backpacks. <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan&#39;s bird list is different.  We printed the Montana species and had<br/>\nit laminated.  It&#39;s about three inches wide by eight inches long , four<br/>\nor five pages with a hole punched in the top for a ring and a clip.  He<br/>\nmarks off birds he sees and the date/location with a permanent marker and<br/>\nthe list can be clipped onto his backpack or zipper or belt loop.   He<br/>\nlikes it because it requires a minimum of writing. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nI always enjoy your posts Julie. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100027905,"authorName":"TreeGoddess","from":"TreeGoddess &lt;treegoddess@...&gt;","profile":"odrade7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Thanks for all the left-handed help!","postDate":"1075045300","msgId":89825,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY4MEQwQ0VCLTRGNEMtMTFEOC1BMDYzLTAwMDM5M0E1REE2NkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGJ2MG45cStwOW0zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGJ2MG45cStwOW0zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":89823,"nextInTopic":89826,"prevInTime":89824,"nextInTime":89826,"topicId":89823,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m left-handed for writing, holding a fork or spoon, and for brushing my teeth.

Everything else I do right-handed....throwing a ball, using <br/>\nscissors, eating with chopsticks, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe spiral-bound notebooks are a real pain in the, well, arm and wrist. <br/>\n  LOL  The other thing that I still have a problem with is getting ink <br/>\nor marker all over the outer edge of my hand as it drags across the <br/>\npaper while writing from left to right.  I&#39;m constantly smudging my <br/>\nstuff.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I want to use a pad of paper I prefer to use the kind that don&#39;t <br/>\nhave a spiral, but rather an edge like a book of checks where the paper <br/>\nis just perforated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as &quot;how&quot; your DS is holding his pen/pencil.... I wouldn&#39;t worry <br/>\nabout it.  I have a really odd way of holding my pen(cil) and it works <br/>\ngreat for me.  My parents, grandparents, and teachers all try to teach <br/>\nme a &quot;better&quot; way, but it wasn&#39;t better for ME.  Don&#39;t sweat it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat reminds me.... one more &quot;retraining&quot; phase that my parents tried <br/>\nto do with me when I was a toddler and learning to eat with <br/>\nutensils.... they bought me a spoon that was bent toward the left so <br/>\nthat if I used it with my right hand the &quot;bowl&quot; of the spoon would go <br/>\ntoward my mouth.  But if I used it with my left hand the spoon would <br/>\npoint away from my mouth.  What kind of twisted trick is that to pull <br/>\non a little kid???  I still didn&#39;t use the darn thing with my right <br/>\nhand.  I just curved my little left arm all the way around and used it <br/>\nthat way.  I still am annoyed that they did that to me instead of just <br/>\nletting me be.<br/>\n-Tracy-<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jan 25, 2004, at 10:27 AM, Julie Bogart wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; It was great to get some ideas for my lefty.
