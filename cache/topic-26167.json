It has some cool features!<br/>\n<br/>\n-          Any user can submit any link, book, dvd, etc. and a description<br/>\nof it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-          Any user can vote on any link, book, dvd, etc. that someone else<br/>\nhas submitted to show that they too like that same resource.<br/>\n<br/>\n-          Any user can mark a link as bad or outdated with a simple click.<br/>\n<br/>\n-          Any user can add comments to a listed resource, and the comments<br/>\ncan also be ranked by helpfulness.<br/>\n<br/>\n-          Resources are categorized into broad categories, and are<br/>\nsearchable.<br/>\n<br/>\n-          They can also be �tagged� so there are an infinite number of<br/>\npossibilities for subcategories too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-          If you like someone�s style, you can select certain users as your<br/>\n�friends� and easily see what resources they submitted or voted for.<br/>\n<br/>\n-          You can add a bookmark to your �Links� section on your browser to<br/>\nquickly add a favorite site to the VHSG Resources list!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you agree that this has the potential to be an amazing resource in<br/>\nitself!  Your child mentions an interest in something; you can easily see<br/>\nwhat others have liked for that particular topic quickly and easily, and you<br/>\ncan add your own feedback as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe site is brand new, and only has my own personal favorites entered at<br/>\nthis moment, and not all of my personal favorites, but some. :-)  In order<br/>\nto become a valuable resource, it needs users and submissions!
