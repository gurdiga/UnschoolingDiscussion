But we have no real computer games.  My daughter spends her computer time doing Amazon quests (where she *identifies* plants and animals from the rainforest,etc., but doesn&#39;t have any *real* sense of what they are,  ...), and making pictures and graphics on mspaint.  I don&#39;t think these things are harmful, per say, but I still see that it is too easy for her to go quickly to the computer for a fix of this when she is wanting something to do rather<br/>\nthan get out the clay or the paints or her sewing.  Right now, I am leaving this alone, trusting that we will find a balance.  And outdoor wild time hasn&#39;t diminished at all!<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I am wondering if the easy attraction to the computer is an influence from me ... I am having to do quite a lot of work at the computer these days and my daughter does not like my mental/emotional absence when I am working.  Because, when I am working, I am not *with* her.  It works if we move a big comfy chair close to my desk with blankets and pillows and books for her to read, but not all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone else having to work at home in this way have interesting ways to help their children to be comfortable with it?   I have only one child, so there is that *intensity* to deal with ...<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Tina thanks for a very thoughtful message.  I have been reading the thread<br/>\n&gt; about computers and wondering a lot about the ups and the downs of their<br/>\n&gt; infuluence on our children.  I know my 7 yo son **loves** them and it can<br/>\n&gt; get a little obsessive and litterally take over his imagintion for periods<br/>\n&gt; of time.  What disturbs me is the loss of other imaginative activities (real<br/>\n&gt; activities as opposed to elecronic simulations... )  (now i am going to get<br/>\n&gt; it)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We had resorted to imposing time limits.... recently we have decided this<br/>\n&gt; restriction may have been making things worse... and so at a family meeting<br/>\n&gt; we arrived at the idea of allowing constructive activities any time, and<br/>\n&gt; allowing games for a half hour per 2 computer hours logged on &quot;constuctive&quot;<br/>\n&gt; activities.<br/>\n&gt; But I still share your concerns about the losses inherent in encouraging<br/>\n&gt; computer literacy.  I agree as well the only thing to do is strive for a<br/>\n&gt; balance and be sure to prestent lots of alternative opportunites to use<br/>\n&gt; &quot;real&quot; materials.<br/>\n&gt; Joshua </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6677,"nextTopicId":6695}}
