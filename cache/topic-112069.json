I have been soaking up the<br/>\nwords they&#39;ve been speaking for over 3 years now.  Not a long time but<br/>\nenough to make a difference.  Let&#39;s just say it&#39;s been a journey I<br/>\nhave no wish to forget.  Rather I wish I could remember all the words<br/>\nthat help the most, more often and with greater clarity than I<br/>\nactually do.  Sometimes I haven&#39;t felt able to breathe, at least not<br/>\nfreely.  But I&#39;m beginning to and beginning also to feel confident<br/>\nthat I can do this thing called unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112065,"nextTopicId":112073}}
