To get an idea of the horrific advice given in this book I<br/>\nhave included<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some examples from the pages of the book below:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Examples:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1) The Pearls recommend whipping infants only a few months old on their<br/>\nbare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skin. They whip their own 4 month old (p.9). They recommend whipping the<br/>\nbare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skin of &quot;every child&quot; (p.2) for &quot;Christians and non-Christians&quot; (p.5)<br/>\nand for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;every transgression&quot; (p.1). Parents who don&#39;t whip their babies into<br/>\ncomplete<br/>\n&gt; &gt; submission are portrayed as indifferemt, lazy, careless and neglectful<br/>\n(p.19)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and are &quot;creating a Nazi&quot; (p.45).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2) On p.60 they recommend whipping babies who cannot sleep and are<br/>\ncrying,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and to never allow them &quot;to get up.&quot; On p.61 they recommend whipping a<br/>\n12 month<br/>\n&gt; &gt; old girl for crying. On p.79 they recommend whipping a 7 month old for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; screaming.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  3) On p.65 co-author Debi Pearl whips the bare leg of a 15 month old<br/>\nshe is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; babysitting, 10 separate times, for not playing with something she tells<br/>\nhim<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to play with. On p.56 Debi Pearl hits a 2 your old so hard &quot;a karate<br/>\nchop like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wheeze came from somewhere deep inside&quot; him.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  4) On p.59 they recommend whipping a 3 year old until he is &quot;totally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; broken.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 5) On p.44 they say not to let the child&#39;s crying while being hit to<br/>\n&quot;cause<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you to lighten up on the intensity or duration of the spanking.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 6) On p.55 the Pearls say a mother should hit her child if he cries for<br/>\nher.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  7) On p.80 they recommend giving a child having a tantrum &quot;a swift<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *forceful* spanking.&quot; On the same page they say to whip small children<br/>\non their bare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skin until they stop screaming. &quot;Don&#39;t be bullied. Give him more of the<br/>\nsame.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; They say to continue whipping until their crying turns into a &quot;wounded,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; submissive whimper.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 8) On p.46 the Pearls say that if a child does obey before being<br/>\nwhipped,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whip them anyway. And &quot;if you have to sit on him to spank him,then do<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hesitate. And hold him there until he is surrendered. Prove that you are<br/>\nbigger,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tougher.&quot; &quot;Defeat him totally.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 9) On p.47 they recommend their various whips, including &quot;a belt or<br/>\nlarger<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tree branch&quot; to hit children.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 10) The Pearls also recommend ignoring an infant&#39;s bumped head when he<br/>\nfalls<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the floor, and ignoring skinned knees (p.86). They also say &quot;if your<br/>\nchild<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is roughed-up by peers, rejoice.&quot; (p.81)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  11) They recommend pulling a nursing infant&#39;s hair (p.7), tripping a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; non-swimming toddler so she falls into deep water (p.67) and to make<br/>\nchildren go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hungry if they don&#39;t &quot;like what is on the table&quot; (p.103). Also on p.103<br/>\nthey say<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that if children lose their shoes, &quot;let them go without until they (the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children) can make the money to buy more.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can only hope that you will look into this publication and the company<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; owners/authors who provide this piece of hateful and abusive propaganda,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have it removed from the hands of our society.

Give him more of the same.&quot; <br/>\nThey say to continue whipping until their crying turns into a &quot;wounded, <br/>\nsubmissive whimper.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n8) On p.46 the Pearls say that if a child does obey before being whipped, <br/>\nwhip them anyway. And &quot;if you have to sit on him to spank him,then do not <br/>\nhesitate. And hold him there until he is surrendered. Prove that you are bigger, <br/>\ntougher.&quot; &quot;Defeat him totally.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n9) On p.47 they recommend their various whips, including &quot;a belt or larger <br/>\ntree branch&quot; to hit children. <br/>\n<br/>\n10) The Pearls also recommend ignoring an infant&#39;s bumped head when he falls <br/>\nto the floor, and ignoring skinned knees (p.86). They also say &quot;if your child <br/>\nis roughed-up by peers, rejoice.&quot; (p.81)<br/>\n<br/>\n 11) They recommend pulling a nursing infant&#39;s hair (p.7), tripping a <br/>\nnon-swimming toddler so she falls into deep water (p.67) and to make children go <br/>\nhungry if they don&#39;t &quot;like what is on the table&quot; (p.103). Also on p.103 they say <br/>\nthat if children lose their shoes, &quot;let them go without until they (the <br/>\nchildren) can make the money to buy more.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can only hope that you will look into this publication and the company and <br/>\nowners/authors who provide this piece of hateful and abusive propaganda, and <br/>\nhave it removed from the hands of our society. If these examples are not enough <br/>\nthen you can always go to amazon.com and read the hundreds of reviews from <br/>\npeople who are equally as disturbed as I am. <br/>\nI have sent copies of this same letter to many new organizations including <br/>\n20/20 and Primetime Live, and can only hope to shed as much light as possible on <br/>\nthis book and it&#39;s authors.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nElaine Nichols<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96131,"nextTopicId":96245}}
