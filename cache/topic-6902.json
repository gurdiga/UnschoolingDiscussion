My kids are going on 6 and going on<br/>\n8, and so far I am delighted about seeing the process of natural learning<br/>\njust happening with so little *effort* on my part.  But I am glad you<br/>\nbrought up the thread of history... I was thinking about it as well just<br/>\nthis week in fact.  I was listening to a program on CBC radio about whether<br/>\nor not we need to emphasize history, and specifically CANADIAN history more<br/>\nin the BC curriculum.  It got me to thinking about that... it is important<br/>\nto me that young people get a since of the history of their country; their<br/>\nheritage etc, as well as a larger since history of human civilization.  I am<br/>\nnot entirely sure that, as is the case with the three R&#39;s, they will just<br/>\npick this up naturally...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only solution I have thought of so far is to re-educate myself and then<br/>\nshare what I am learning in the form of &quot;stories&quot;... and hopefully spawn an<br/>\ninterest so that later on they will continue to add pieces to the puzzle as<br/>\nthey present themselves in life.  I like the idea of making it into an<br/>\nengrossing tale I can share with them.  It just seems to me this is one area<br/>\nwhere natural learning might require a lot of &quot;homework&quot; on my part!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking forward to reading other people&#39;s ideas in this regard as<br/>\nwell...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MorelFam@...\">MorelFam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 01, 2000 9:33 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] history ideas<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MorelFam@...\">MorelFam@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; we have been homeschooling since my 10yr old arrived at birth.  her sibs<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; an almost 8yr sister, and two brothers almost 4 and 20mos.  we are<br/>\nexpecting<br/>\n&gt; our 5th child to arrive in july.  the way homeschooling has worked for us<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; collaborative learning...  for eg. if i see that10yodd needs some more<br/>\n&gt; &quot;substance,&quot; i encourage something and she either agrees or not, and we go<br/>\n&gt; from there.  it has worked beautifully as she has not lost a love for<br/>\n&gt; learning and is very self motivated, taking on self-created projects<br/>\noften.<br/>\n&gt; my question involves history.  i hated (who didnt?) the boring historical<br/>\n&gt; facts presented in school and therefore remember little of what i parroted<br/>\n&gt; back short term to do well.  dd reads voraciously and has read plenty of<br/>\n&gt; historical fiction choices, which i assume she will continue to do.  i am<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; sure about presentation of history.  this sonlight curriculum list offers<br/>\n&gt; interesting options for a reading list.  and their idea seems to be that<br/>\none<br/>\n&gt; can learn history by: a) read the books, and b) plug them into a timeline.<br/>\ni<br/>\n&gt; am wondering about other ways that your children have acquired a knowledge<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; history, besides randomly, which might work just as well!  especially<br/>\nparents<br/>\n&gt; of older kids, do you end up having them &quot;do&quot; a course in highschool to<br/>\n&gt; satisfy pre-college credit?<br/>\n&gt; tia for related thoughts...<br/>\n&gt; erin in tn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get your money connected @ OnMoney.com - the first Web site that lets you<br/>\n&gt; see, consolidate, and manage all of your finances all in one place.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/1636/5/_/448294/_/951932049/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/1636/5/_/448294/_/951932049/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6910,"nextTopicId":6916}}
