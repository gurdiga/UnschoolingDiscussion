In Jr.<br/>\nHigh, I was fascinated with the idea of studying ocean life. I thought<br/>\n I would LOVE that job. You know what my parents said &quot;You better<br/>\nstart doing better at math, that job involved a LOT of math&quot; and laughed.<br/>\n<br/>\nUgh. That was like a big puncture to MY balloon. I hated math. I knew<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t do anything with lotsa math. I never wanted to take math again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey could have gotten excited with me, taken me to aquariums, helped<br/>\nme set up tanks, gotten me movies etc... and FED the interest. By the<br/>\ntime I would have needed the math, I would have been older and more<br/>\ncapable. Who knows where it might have led?  Even if I&#39;d decided NOT<br/>\nto become a biologist, I would have felt honored and like my interests<br/>\nmattered.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really glad you were able to shift the focus of your conversation<br/>\nto support his interest in sharks.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen, who watched Jaws last week<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"New to unschooling need some advice","postDate":"1140158780","msgId":112158,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR0M3JmcytsdHVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":112178,"prevInTime":112157,"nextInTime":112159,"topicId":112158,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-What schools call math is actually a foreign language.-=- It s a language that can be understood by all sorts of people that don t speak the same","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-280862688\">&quot;-=-What schools call &quot;math&quot; is actually a foreign language.-=-&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a &quot;language&quot; that can be understood by all sorts of people that<br/>\ndon&#39;t speak the same language!:) <br/>\n<br/>\nMath is actually a natural instinct imo.
