He has been home, on worker&#39;s compensation for the whole time.<br/>\nIt has been a wonderful blessing for us to have him here for so much of<br/>\nJayn&#39;s toddlerhood. I think she would really miss him if he wasn&#39;t<br/>\naround. Of course he is not trying to get work accomplished, but does<br/>\nspend a lot of time on the computer and his ham radios in our &quot;office&quot;<br/>\nin the dining room. We live in a one bedroom apartment.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband absolutely hates Jayn&#39;s habit of sleeping late, and mine.<br/>\nRegardless of what I may have accomplished in the morning in my pyjamas,<br/>\nI have not &quot;started my day&quot; unless I am dressed. I have noticed that<br/>\nJayn&#39;s most enriched play happens in the night after dinner, but he<br/>\nstill gets upset that she is late to bed. However, he blames me for her<br/>\nsleep habits, and not her. He&#39;s probably right. I still like to live<br/>\ntheater hours, after a life in the theater. Unfortunately it sometimes<br/>\nleads to harsh words between us.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes dream of the larger home we will one day have, with James<br/>\nand all his electronic /computer junk in a shed at the bottom of the<br/>\ngarden. But then I will probably miss having him around. Sometimes he<br/>\ngets snippy about the house not being clean enough, particularly when he<br/>\nhasn&#39;t been home to see what all Jayn and I have been doing all day<br/>\ninstead of cleaning up her toys. Another reason to dream of a house<br/>\nwhere there might actually be a playroom to at least store Jayn&#39;s toys<br/>\nin.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat amazes me is how helpless he is - I don&#39;t mean because of his knee<br/>\n- he can now walk fine. He will literally sit around for hours being<br/>\nhungry and cranky, until I cook breakfast. &quot;Why don&#39;t you just cook<br/>\nyourself some bacon and eggs?&quot;. Also I end up fetching his drinks, and<br/>\ndoing all of his word processing for different hobbies etc for him.<br/>\nBeware Mary! You could end up being an administrative assistant/gopher.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBut in the end, I like that he is with us so much.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;All of a sudden, what I thought I would have loved most, having Joe<br/>\nhome all <br/>\nday, is stressing me out.
