How <br/>\ndare someone teach me how to &quot;square&quot; and how to find the &quot;square <br/>\nroot&quot; without ever telling me what it means!  How dare someone force <br/>\nme to memorize trigonometric formulas without ever telling me that <br/>\ntrigonometry means the measurement of triangles!  How dare they cram <br/>\nthese squiggles and rules into my head without ever telling me what I <br/>\nwas supposed to be doing!  I could cry.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorcha</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66247,"nextTopicId":65741}}
