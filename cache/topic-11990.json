Yes, more women should take responsibility<br/>\nfor their actions, however, the resulting life should not be punished<br/>\nbecause someone thinks they should be forced to have that unwanted child. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t a perfect world and no one has the right to make moral decisions<br/>\nfor someone else.  If the pro-lifers have their way there will be many<br/>\ndeaths from back alley abortions.  There will also be instances of women<br/>\nhaving to go to term and then delivering terminally deformed or dead<br/>\nfetuses.  We had several cases of fetuses that were not complete and would<br/>\nhave continued to term but would have &quot;died&quot; shortly after birth and would<br/>\nhave only lived that short time on machines.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had the misfortune of working in the radiology department of a large<br/>\nhospital.  All the child abuse cases came through our department as the law<br/>\nrequired full body x-rays to be done to check for prior injuries.  While<br/>\nsome of you may express the sentiments that you would rather be abused than<br/>\naborted, I&#39;m sure there are others that would disagree.  I&#39;m sure the child<br/>\nwe came to know as &quot;Sunny&quot; would have preferred not to be born than to have<br/>\ncigerettes put out on his little legs; than to have needles broken off<br/>\nunder his fingernails; than to be thrown through a window and left outside<br/>\nall night; than to be later returned to his parents because they were<br/>\n&quot;cured&quot; after counseling.  Did I mention that &quot;Sunny&quot; was 11 months old and<br/>\nthat we were all threatened with jail because we faked continuing medical<br/>\nproblems and kept him in the hospital for 3 extra months.  Oh, in case I<br/>\nforgot to mention it, 6 weeks after we were forced to release him from the<br/>\nhospital to his parents, he was dead.  AND, at the trial, the mother was<br/>\nheard to say &quot;See, if I&#39;d had that abortion we wouldn&#39;t be going to jail<br/>\nnow.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can give you lots more of those kind of cases that I personally<br/>\nwitnessed.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda, who quite working there because she was about 1 day away from<br/>\nmurdering some sorry excuse for a parent!<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jaam1224@...\">Jaam1224@...</a><br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] our bodies<br/>\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, August 16, 2000 12:11 PM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree on many points Amy has brought up (adoption from other countries<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; tons of abuse in our country), but I don&#39;t believe abortion is the answer<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; over-population or the solution to not wanting a baby ....(this is going<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sound crude and there are exceptions to everything) but I have a huge<br/>\n </span></blockquote>problem <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; with women using abortion as a means of birth control.

As soon as humans began<br/>\nto live in societies of significant numbers, certain necessary &quot;rules&quot;<br/>\nbecame evident to ensure the safety of the civilization and individual<br/>\nproperty rights. Let&#39;s be harsh for a moment, and say: since unborn babies<br/>\nare not yet &quot;property&quot;, but the woman carrying the child is, her welfare<br/>\noverrides the potential real estate inside her womb.  I suppose this leads<br/>\nme to argue that making abortion illegal doesn&#39;t serve the purpose of<br/>\nensuring the safety of the civilization, people and property at large in the<br/>\nU.S.-excepting in a purely long distance survival/future shock sort of way.<br/>\nGiven the world population dilemma, this is not something which is much of a<br/>\nconcern right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo those reading-I use the term &quot;property&quot; in the most abstract sense.
