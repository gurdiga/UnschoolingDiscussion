For YEARS I had tried  to get him <br/>\ninterested in music, including teaching them how to read music  (nominally) <br/>\nand when I finally let go, he did it himself!<br/>\n <br/>\nLike I mentioned, he never wanted to read.  He&#39;d read what he was  &quot;made&quot; to <br/>\nread to do his schoolwork, but that was it.  When I let go,  suddenly he&#39;s <br/>\nfinding books he can&#39;t set down.  Yesterday, he was helping  my husband with <br/>\nstuff around here, and suddenly stopped and said, &quot;Dad, can we  take a break and <br/>\nfinish this later?  I have to get to the library before  they close so I can <br/>\nget the next book.&quot;  (in the series he&#39;s  reading.)  <br/>\n <br/>\nHe has started working out with weights, and has a &quot;plan&quot; that he goes  by, <br/>\nand he&#39;s stuck with it pretty well.  He checks out cool videos at the  library <br/>\n(National Geographic, etc) and actually enjoys them.  We have lots  of cool <br/>\ndiscusstions about things.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHis computer knowledge has increased, as he&#39;s helped my husband set up our  <br/>\nhousehold system (we have 5 computers hooked up).  He&#39;s learning the DVD  <br/>\nmaking program, and him and another son have plans of making a movie.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s like, we spent all that time before fretting and fussing over  <br/>\ncurriculum, gotta get it done, oh crap, it&#39;s getting late in the day, hurry up  and get <br/>\nyour schoolwork done!  Oh no, now it&#39;s getting late in the year, we  still <br/>\nhave all these books we have to finish...come on, we have to sit down and  get <br/>\nthis done!  <br/>\n <br/>\nAll of our lives have improved since I just let go.  I don&#39;t &quot;do  <br/>\nnothing&quot;...I still offer a lot of stuff to the kids.  If I see a book I  think one child <br/>\nmight like, I&#39;ll buy it (cartoon drawing, manga, water painting,  etc.)  I <br/>\npick up a lot of movies at the library, and I send them a lot of  stuff I find on <br/>\nthe internet that I think they might like.  We go to the  library and get a <br/>\nTON of books each week.  Sometimes they only look at  them, sometimes they read <br/>\na few, sometimes they spend hours reading, and  sometimes they barely touch <br/>\nthem, but THEY picked them out, they are books that  interest THEM.  And I&#39;ll <br/>\npick out an art book (one of those huge coffee  table types) each week, and a <br/>\nfew science type books, and they can look at them,  or not.  I spend a lot of <br/>\ntime with them, but the time isn&#39;t spent  stressing out over what they know and <br/>\ndon&#39;t know.  <br/>\n <br/>\nNancy B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255994291,"authorName":"windlesara","from":"&quot;windlesara&quot; &lt;windlesara@...&gt;","profile":"windlesara","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"unmotivated teen","postDate":"1138474451","msgId":111559,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRyZ2VraitmcmQ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":111563,"prevInTime":111558,"nextInTime":111560,"topicId":111559,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, new to this message board idea, never attempted it beore in my life.

My husband and I have a 14 yr old son.  His education history <br/>\nis this:k-1 public, 2-4 priviate christian, 5-7 public, 8 not truly <br/>\nunschooled, 9 (currently) accredited online homeschool (morning star <br/>\nacademy).  My delimma is this my husband and I both work, truly out <br/>\nof necessity.  It would be my absoulte dream to stay home for what <br/>\nis left of my son&#39;s time with us, but finanacially impossible.  As <br/>\nit is I work part time for full time pay, arranged with boss with no <br/>\nraises for the past several years, just decreasingly less hours. We <br/>\ndon&#39;t work to upkeep a lifestyle, we work to feed, house and cloth <br/>\nourselves literally.  Any way back to my point, my son is doing good <br/>\nat online school but has to have lots of prompting to complete the <br/>\nwork and only does the bare minimum required. I am truly <br/>\nconsidering  unschooling for the rest of his highschool years, but i <br/>\nam concerned about his lack of motivation.  He is interested in <br/>\nvideo games and yugioh trading cards and tv.  He only has 2 come to <br/>\nthe <br/>\nhouse friends and never goes to their house.  He does attend youth <br/>\ngroup 2x weekly and ejoys it.  He goes every saturday to card <br/>\ntournament with around 20-30 other participants and interacts.  I <br/>\nhave only in the last couple of months come to grips with the fact <br/>\nthat this is good thing...the video games and card tournaments and <br/>\ncollecting cards, and my acceptance has helped him feel better, but <br/>\nI worry that he shows no interest in absolutely anything else, in <br/>\nfact he even hates to go outside and goof off and <br/>\ndon&#39;t know if unschooling will help unleash interest or not? Please <br/>\ngive any insight into this matter that you can, i&#39;m very interested.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111640,"nextTopicId":111615}}
