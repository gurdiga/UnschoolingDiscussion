Video, or whatever.   Music in <br/>\nthe car.  Singing along.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we had company once the person said we didn&#39;t have music on when she was <br/>\nthere.  Well we had company!  We were talking and going places.  So when we <br/>\ndon&#39;t have company, there&#39;s often music.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly just lately had me make her a replacement tape for one she wore out.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s similar but different, because by eliminating some things she was tired <br/>\nof, we had more space.  It has at least one and sometimes three songs by Buffalo <br/>\nSpringfield, The Hollies, Linda Ronstadt, Donovan, Herman&#39;s Hermits, The <br/>\nBeatles, Joni Mitchell, John Denver...  maybe more.
