That comes right back to them, so it is either a draw or a<br/>\nloss for the local community.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen doing purchasing, they purchase with an &quot;over or under&quot; clause so that<br/>\nthey get the price break which translates to if I order 10 M units and you<br/>\nare only able to ship 9.8 M, that is o.k. or I will take the 10.6 M that<br/>\nyou end up shipping.  Now, that means, when you see the add for the $99<br/>\nt.v., don&#39;t hold your breath because you aren&#39;t going to get a rain check. <br/>\nYou see, that was one that ended up on the &quot;under&quot; side of an order so each<br/>\nstore only got 6.  But they got you in the store and stats show that you<br/>\nwill spend at least $25 to $50 anyway once you are there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on all day<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Susan and Theodore &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stuff@...\">Stuff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Interesting Seasonal Ritual-----OH no<br/>\n </span></blockquote>WALMART<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Date: Saturday, November 27, 1999 12:21 AM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Susan and Theodore&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stuff@...\">Stuff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Lynda &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nooooo, not Wal-Mart the most evil of all corporate empires.
