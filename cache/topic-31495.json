I suppose its better to just ignore the one&#39;s that always <br/>\nobject to an issue as opposed to stop discussing differences.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Which is why this list continues to have problems.<br/>\n&gt;When a list is regularly &quot;outing&quot; people that don&#39;t say exactly what <br/>\n&gt;you want to hear, that is a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All lists that have &#39;cutting edge&#39; ideals will have issues. Thats why the <br/>\n&#39;spiritual parenting&#39; list I spoke of didn&#39;t have issues. Everyone <br/>\ncomplimented eachother, gave hugs, love and blessing and THAT list had NO <br/>\nsubstance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I wish I could understand what is so offensive about someone <br/>\n&gt;questioning the words you use. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t either when its used for clarification. Since geography and even <br/>\n&#39;family&#39; uses words that mean one thing and another person processes that <br/>\nword to mean another.<br/>\nLanguage.. why can&#39;t we all just do a Vulcan mind meld and get our <br/>\nthoughts out without the damn words!!! *smile*<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I don&#39;t remember saying anything <br/>\n&gt;dirogatory to the person I questioned. If I attacked a strongly held <br/>\n&gt;belief then it should be easy enough to explain it and stand your <br/>\n&gt;ground, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I missed the whole incident since I was busy on another listserv the last <br/>\nfew weeks with another issue (the scientific findings of the real Planet <br/>\nX - and you should see the fur fly!).So I went on a digest here. I don&#39;t <br/>\nalways get a chance to read them and deleted a lot of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut from what I&#39;ve read here the differing opinions are not that <br/>\ndifferent. Just some bad communication. I&#39;d like to go back into the <br/>\narchives, but reading Yahoo online is a torture for me, even with a <br/>\nhigh-speed connection.<br/>\n<br/>\n(For those that are into Astrology, Mercury is in retrgrade since the <br/>\n15th or so of January and that means that communications is at a all time <br/>\nlow, or an all time high for miscommunications) Personally, I know <br/>\nnothing of Astrology and dont&#39; hold a beleif about it either way - just <br/>\npassing on some info from people that are into it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If not, then we could discuss it and seek further understanding.<br/>\n&gt;Either way, there shouldn&#39;t be this ugliness shown to any dissenters.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in total agreement. There&#39;s nothing like a great debate to either <br/>\nsolidfy your own view or knock it off its axis enough for one to take a <br/>\nlook at oneself.<br/>\n<br/>\nKinda like thinking things through out loud.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nkolleen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31592,"nextTopicId":31562}}
