We&#39;re a big gaming family, so I&#39;m sure eventually we&#39;ll get the PS2 <br/>\nas well, but the Game Cube was cheaper.

The answer<br/>\nboiled down to that it depends on what your priority is. I gather that<br/>\nPS has the greater number of games, but the X-Box has the capacity for<br/>\nhigher quality of visuals, and can do a High Definition output. My DH<br/>\nplays a lot of X-box live games on the internet and uses his unit as a<br/>\nserver for other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do get the X-Box it is very worthwhile to also get a subscription<br/>\nto X-Box Magazine. They send playable samples and demos of games with<br/>\neach monthly issue, and it is a great resource for deciding which games<br/>\nto buy or rent. I enjoy reading the comprehensive reviews of games, even<br/>\nthough I rarely try the machine.
