IOW, she is much more in charge of everything they <br/>\ndo, pushing them and giving them assignments and making them do <br/>\nthings. Her kids don&#39;t turn into monsters when she isn&#39;t around, <br/>\neither. They are impressive people with kind hearts who love her very <br/>\nmuch. She governs them tightly and lets them grow into self-<br/>\ngovernment in a quite &quot;traditional&quot; way, and it seems to work <br/>\nextremely well. They are kids whom other kids as well as adults like <br/>\nto be with, sort of like the kids I hear described on this board, yet <br/>\nthey haven&#39;t been unschooled by anyone&#39;s definition.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, she hasn&#39;t had a limitless candy policy at her house. They have <br/>\nsome, and she doesn&#39;t say no when they get a piece, yet, the candy in <br/>\nthe little dish on her kitchen counter sits all day, every day. The <br/>\nkids pretty much leave it alone. TV and computer are similar; they <br/>\nhave both, but my kids are drawn to it like a magnet...her kids can <br/>\ntake it or leave it...they&#39;ve never gone through a phase of computer <br/>\ngames as their main free time activity, nor have they gone through a <br/>\nconsume all the candy in sight phase...<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to what I was reading at the time I decided to try the <br/>\ncandy bowl experiment, it is limits that make kids crave (the candy <br/>\nand eat it all gone) (Insert any &quot;forbidden&quot; item for candy), but my <br/>\nfriend&#39;s home, a &quot;tight ship&quot; for SURE, would not bear that out. <br/>\nThere I see a house where there are limits, yet the kids don&#39;t go <br/>\nnuts on the candy.<br/>\n<br/>\nand so I wonder what REALLY causes kids to not crave it. Is it the <br/>\nfact that she pours herself into them, 100%+? Keeps them very busy <br/>\nall the time, so they have many interests everywhere in the city and <br/>\nthey get satiated with experiences?...because in her case, it isn&#39;t <br/>\nunlimited supply. <br/>\n<br/>\nanyway. Something tells me successful homeschooling, whether school-<br/>\nat-home or relaxed or radical unschooling, has more to do with <br/>\nparental involvement and enjoyment of their kids, than any other <br/>\nthing. My friend is able to use more traditional, parent controlled <br/>\nstyles of homeschooling and still enjoy her kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, HeidiC<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, pam sorooshian <br/>\n&lt;pamsoroosh@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Nov 10, 2003, at 10:42 AM, Heidi wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; But I don&#39;t see it as a limit, per se, as much as my preferring <br/>\n </span></blockquote>not<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; to have it around the house all the time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What was your reason for wanting to try the no-limits experiment?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt; National Home Education Network<br/>\n&gt; &lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Serving the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\n&gt; through information, networking and public relations. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Instincts and The Bottomless Candy Bowl","postDate":"1068493624","msgId":84395,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE5MEU0RDE2LTEzQjYtMTFEOC1BMUNGLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJvb202YittNnNqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGJvb202YittNnNqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":84394,"nextInTopic":84401,"prevInTime":84394,"nextInTime":84396,"topicId":84357,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Not a problem. I don&#39;t buy candy and have it around, but as a <br/>\nrule, I also don&#39;t buy processed foods, not even frozen fries, not <br/>\neven thrift store bread.

I am just <br/>\nnow managing to have a bite of something sweet and leave the rest -  <br/>\na skill that my daughter, thankfully, has by instinct and has never <br/>\nlost.  It took me a long time to realize that it had nothing to do <br/>\nwith &quot;will power&quot; -- it had to do with &quot;feast or famine&quot; type <br/>\ninstincts.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As a teenager, when I had more money at my disposal, I started eating <br/>\nwhatever and wheneverstarted putting on weight, too, and it&#39;s been a <br/>\nissue my whole adult life, my weight. Anyway, just to let you know, I <br/>\ndo understand this feeling of &quot;must all be eaten whenever presented.&quot; <br/>\nMine has more to do with a controlling mom, though. Budgetary <br/>\ncontrols or not, she had something to say about every single thing I <br/>\never tried to do, and not much of it to the tune of Well Done. Eating <br/>\nwhat I wanted was my way of controlling my own self. But I also used <br/>\nto love any and all candy, anything so long as it was sweet. My <br/>\ntastes have refined a bit by now, so that I prefer certain things <br/>\nover others. Will my kids start doing that at an earlier age, if it&#39;s <br/>\nall presented equally, all the time? Probably. I&#39;m seeing it with <br/>\ncomputer games and my 10year old boy. He knows what he likes in that <br/>\narena, and shuns what he doesn&#39;t like. Will my kids eventually figure <br/>\nout that some candy is worth it and some isn&#39;t, even if I don&#39;t have <br/>\na full candy bowl in the house? Probably. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a fact of life in our family right now, though: tight budget. <br/>\nLiving in the boonies. Natural/whole foods/Granola for a mom.

My whole adult <br/>\n  life, I&#39;ve chosen whole foods and scratch cooking and healthy stuff. <br/>\n  Haven&#39;t outlawed candy or any other food, but I&#39;ve always kept a <br/>\n  fruit bowl and had things like cheese and crackers or ants on a log <br/>\n  for snacks. Putting out a bowl full of candy for whomever to have <br/>\n  whenever isn&#39;t something I would naturally, normally do. <br/>\n<br/>\n  And the reason was, I wondered how kids who hadn&#39;t been limited (i.e. <br/>\n  candy has never been outlawed, I just don&#39;t usually buy it) don&#39;t <br/>\n  seem able to ignore a candy bowl at my friend&#39;s house and gobble <br/>\n  their Halloween candy in a day or two. The advice here was to make it <br/>\n  truly unlimited, all the time. They&#39;d eventually get tired of it, and <br/>\n  the candy would sit. I believe this would happen IF I actually <br/>\n  decided to keep a candy bowl around all the time. I may not.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And here&#39;s why. Well, there are lots of reasons. <br/>\n<br/>\n  1) we live out in the country. With the fruit bowl, when the fruit is <br/>\n  gone, we don&#39;t get more until the next trip to the grocery <br/>\n  store...twice a month to the big city; once a week to the town, but <br/>\n  we go to the library, not the expensive grocery store there, unless <br/>\n  there&#39;s something on sale that I need to restock. If I only replenish <br/>\n  the fruit when I&#39;m grocery shopping, I won&#39;t be refilling the candy <br/>\n  bowl more often. <br/>\n<br/>\n  2) we are on a tight budget right now. It was mentioned, once the <br/>\n  kids are satiated, they won&#39;t eat the candy all gone and it won&#39;t be <br/>\n  expensive. Well...my budget may not allow for the time to pass while <br/>\n  the kids become satiated. Life in this family right now is: we are <br/>\n  cutting back, especially in areas where personal choices make the <br/>\n  most difference (I HAVE to pay the credit cards; I DON&#39;T HAVE to buy <br/>\n  foods that lack nutrition)<br/>\n<br/>\n  3) I kind of like a concept I read in The McDougall Plan (a vegan <br/>\n  lifestyle book)...where it is explained that in most cultures, people <br/>\n  eat very simply on a day to day basis, and have two or three big <br/>\n  community feasts per year. The author was saying that most cultures <br/>\n  eat no meat except on feast days. I don&#39;t know about THAT, but the <br/>\n  concept stuck with me. If you keep things simple on a daily basis, <br/>\n  when a &quot;feast day&quot; comes, all the goodies that go with it are all the <br/>\n  better for not having been around every day. Like going without rich <br/>\n  foods for the Lenten Season, and breaking that fast with an Easter <br/>\n  meal...how much better that food will be, because it&#39;s been put away <br/>\n  for a season.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It isn&#39;t my plan to serve rice and veggies and only break out the <br/>\n  Yummy Stuff at Christmas and Easter, but what is so wrong with how we <br/>\n  were doing candy around here, before? That is, once a week, the kids <br/>\n  get allowance and no limits on what they spend it on. And they have <br/>\n  always spent it on either candy or Pokemon cards. (I&#39;m also not <br/>\n  saying that anyone here thought it was wrong...just thinking out <br/>\n  loud, because I&#39;ve changed some very fundamental things in the house <br/>\n  and need to think about it)<br/>\n<br/>\n  4) thinking about it, their eating all their Halloween candy in a day <br/>\n  or two doesn&#39;t bother me. It goes along with that feast mentality: <br/>\n  they don&#39;t get it every day, so when they do, they consume it. It&#39;s a <br/>\n  treat to them. <br/>\n<br/>\n  so, back to Instincts. The first thing that came to mind, reading the <br/>\n  post about following one&#39;s instincts without always coming to the <br/>\n  experts, was that child rearing method that puts babies on a feeding <br/>\n  schedule and adamantly opposes bringing them to bed with you, etc. So <br/>\n  counter-intuitive. A mother&#39;s instinct is to have the baby nearby all <br/>\n  the time, and to feed the baby when he needs feeding. Some bonehead <br/>\n  comes along and says &quot;No! You&#39;ll have spoiled kids if you feed on <br/>\n  demand and taking them to bed with you is bad for your marriage&quot; and  <br/>\n  people bought into that system so completely, some mothers were even <br/>\n  denying food to their babies who were genuinely hungry, <br/>\n  because &quot;there is no feeding scheduled for another half hour&quot;...erg.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Even so, my instinct about having fruit and veggie sticks and <br/>\n  crackers around for snacking, and let candy come and go as it does <br/>\n  without providing an endless supply, is appropriate. In Heidi&#39;s <br/>\n  House, there isn&#39;t a candy bowl, any more than there is a level of <br/>\n  clutter that you have to make a path in order to get around. I prefer <br/>\n  to keep the clutter off the floor (though the tables and counters <br/>\n  often...er, always...have stuff on them) and so, I keep the floor <br/>\n  decluttered.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I prefer not to have lots of sugary stuff around all the time, and so <br/>\n  I don&#39;t buy candy and put it out in a bowl.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Last year, at Christmas time, I made my usual batches of homemade <br/>\n  Almond Roca and had some out in a dish. The kids tentatively <br/>\n  approached, and I said &quot;Have some. Have as much as you want&quot;...you <br/>\n  should have seen the looks on their faces. Disbelief faded into <br/>\n  happiness. Actually, I felt pretty bad that their first response was <br/>\n  disbelief. I&#39;d been so controlling, that I&#39;d actually put out my <br/>\n  famous homemade toffee in a dish when there was no company coming <br/>\n  over, and say &quot;Don&#39;t touch&quot; to my kids! I&#39;ll not be going back to <br/>\n  that way of doing things, ever. <br/>\n<br/>\n  OTOH, why go against my instincts about candy? I&#39;ve never provided an <br/>\n  endless supply; I&#39;m a Granola at heart, and think less candy is <br/>\n  better, though I don&#39;t say no when they buy candy w/their allowance <br/>\n  money...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well...that&#39;s where my thoughts have been the last couple of days. <br/>\n  Pretty much just thinking out loud and learning to incorporate these <br/>\n  ideas in our life.<br/>\n<br/>\n  blessings, HeidiC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
