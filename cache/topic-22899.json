I have a 7yob, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a distributor of curricula have you come in contact<br/>\nwith many homeschoolers?  Are the legalities<br/>\nuncomfortable in SA? Do most folks do homeschooling<br/>\nnow? or less than in the past? What sort of school did<br/>\nyou grow up with? Confusing, I would guess, by the<br/>\nages of you children I put you in late twenties.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if there is a way to be parents that isn&#39;t<br/>\nintensive? <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose I&#39;m one of those sorts who has more<br/>\nquestions than answers.

We&#39;ve &quot;officially&quot; been<br/>\nhomeschooling for nearly two years now (we were doing some intensive<br/>\n&quot;parenting&quot; before then *grin*).  We&#39;ve been following a delight directed<br/>\nUnit Study approach for our content subjects using good childrens literature<br/>\nto tie it all together (FIAR has sort of guided us and given me tons of<br/>\nconfidence to &quot;go-it-on-my-own&quot;).  For Math we&#39;ve been dabbling around in<br/>\nMiquon (and loving it) and for phonics we use Letterland (a British<br/>\ncurriculum) to introduce the alphabet and the phonic sounds but have moved<br/>\nonto the British version of Reading Reflex to actually teach reading when<br/>\nwe&#39;ve felt like some formal stuff.  I&#39;ve just completed the Unschooling<br/>\nHandbook by Mary Griffith and am very excited to slide into this method of<br/>\nlearning (just find the Math-thing a little daunting!)  I&#39;m the South<br/>\nAfrican distributor of all the above mentioned curricula so this change of<br/>\ndirection is sort of embarassing *smile* !  I was sooo pleased to see Teri<br/>\non this List as I&#39;ve just discovered your beautiful Site and the book you<br/>\nwrote for Christian Unschoolers on the &#39;Net!!!
