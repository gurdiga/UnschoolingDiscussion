Debi, smiling angelically, and hoping you all at least snicker instead of getting mad.  I&#39;m not trying to be further divisive, just provide a little comic relief.  In Canada, we used to have a TV show called &quot;4 on the Floor&quot;, and one of the weekly sketches was called &quot;Mr. Canoe Head&quot;.  It was always introduced as being a &quot;story so outrageous, only a Mormon would believe it!&quot;  That line always cracked me up.  On another side note, last time I was in Israel, I wanted to see some of the sites (and sights) related to Jesus and His journeys.  Imagine my surprise (and snickering) to see places labelled &quot;Catholic Shepherd&#39;s Field&quot;  &quot;Baptists&#39; Shepherd Field&quot;  etc -- I didn&#39;t even know the shepherds that were informed by the angels that Christ was born had denominations!  Okay, I am being facetious here, but the point is -- why freak out about exactly which field the angels appeared in?  Surely the important thing is that they came at all! (If that is what you believe)  Some of the posts on this line are fun to read and think about, others spread far more heat than light.

This is where the fundamentalist &quot;Do this, <br/>\ndon&#39;t do that ...&quot; comes from; the belief that it is up to us to please God. <br/>\n*This is the very thing that Jesus preached AGAINST!* <br/>\n<br/>\nThe burden of being righteous gives no hope for the murderer, raised in the <br/>\nghetto, forsaken by both parents and his own country. No hope for the wife <br/>\nwhose husband left her with no money and 5 kids and no ability or desire to <br/>\ncheck to see if there is &quot;sin in her life that maybe needs to be confessed,&quot; <br/>\nor that maybe she &quot;needs to get right with God,&quot; and &quot;have faith.&quot; Have <br/>\nfaith? After that? Get right with God? How does such a person in such a state <br/>\neven know what goes on in her own heart, let alone tell whether or not her <br/>\n&quot;sinner&#39;s prayer&quot; was sincere? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference between the above, and orthodox evangelicalism, is that <br/>\northodoxy teaches that *God has already got right with us!* Period. End of <br/>\nstory. It&#39;s not about what you eat, drink, watch, teach, or screw. God is <br/>\nfaithful; God is righteous; God is good; God is holy; God has forgiven us in <br/>\nChrist; and the goodness of Christ -- not our goodness -- is what gets us to <br/>\nHeaven. These are all gifts from God that people can do nothing to earn. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny moral reform in the believer&#39;s life is the result of the private inner <br/>\nworkings of the Holy Spirit, and is known as &quot;sanctification.&quot; Sanctification <br/>\nis not man&#39;s effort at getting holy, or again, &quot;getting right with God.&quot; It <br/>\nis the exact opposite. It is God working in the believer, patiently, to make <br/>\nthe believer more like God. The intention of sanctification is not to make <br/>\nthe sinner more pleasing to God -- that has already been accomplished by <br/>\nChrist -- but because holiness is God&#39;s nature, and he made man in his image. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhether it&#39;s true or not is another thing altogether.  : )<br/>\n<br/>\nBob <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":106899874,"authorName":"David and Bonnie Altman","from":"David and Bonnie Altman &lt;altman@...&gt;","profile":"nofiaformk","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Dear Bob, re: religion","postDate":"1029446615","msgId":41206,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxQzI0NDc4LjIyMDk2MzAwLmFsdG1hbkBldjEubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":41205,"nextInTopic":41229,"prevInTime":41205,"nextInTime":41207,"topicId":41188,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Dear Bob, re: religion","postDate":"1029445831","msgId":41205,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYzMEdvQVFseldReExXcTM0Q00wMDAxMzk3NUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":41192,"nextInTopic":41206,"prevInTime":41204,"nextInTime":41206,"topicId":41188,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
