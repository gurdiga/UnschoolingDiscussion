The<br/>\nonly difference between bad and good students in this respect is that the<br/>\nbad students forget right away, while the good students are careful to wait<br/>\nuntil after the exam.  If for no other reason we could well afford to throw<br/>\nout most of what we teach in school because the children throw out almost<br/>\nall of it anyway.&quot; (How Children Fail, 1964, p.175 in my edition).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe middle sentence is actually my favorite!
