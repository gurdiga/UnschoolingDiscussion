(She being a case in point.)  And <br/>\nthat assuming anything about &quot;all&quot; christian homeschoolers is a form of bigotry. <br/>\n Shele428, did i get this right?  Perhaps I misunderstood.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa H.<br/>\n##########<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think any of us have ever said ALL Christian homeschoolers are <br/>\nfundamentalists or that all fundamentalists are pushy school-at-home types. But the <br/>\nmajority ARE. And if someone is not aware of this very vocal movement they <br/>\nshould be. I am a Christian, but not a fundamentalist, and I have some views that <br/>\nmany Christians would probably consider unchristian, I&#39;m sure. As such I&#39;m in <br/>\na minority amongst the fundamentalist-rigid-child suppressing-Christian-Right <br/>\nWing-School-at-homers (as a Christian who homeschools particularly unschools <br/>\nbecause most who are like the above do not unschool) and with unschoolers as <br/>\nwell. (But I am accepted with unschoolers; Christian or not where I would never <br/>\nbe with the above mentioned.) <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is too bad that there are degrees of Christianity. And anyone who would <br/>\nsay there aren&#39;t is lying to himself. I am active in my church; participate on <br/>\nvarious councils, women&#39;s group, youth leader, etc. But there are those who <br/>\nwould say after all that that I am not a good Christian nor am I the &quot;right&quot; kind <br/>\nof Christian. I don&#39;t wear a dress every day, I don&#39;t sit my kids down at 8 <br/>\nam sharp every morning for prayer and lessons, I don&#39;t go to the &quot;right&quot; <br/>\nchurch, I don&#39;t practice wifely submission, I don&#39;t read my bible everyday ... Then <br/>\nthere are the things I do! I do believe in women&#39;s rights, I do listen to all <br/>\nsorts of music, I do believe in listening to my kids and truly hearing their <br/>\nvoices and opinions, I do &quot;allow&quot; them to participate in sports and mingle with <br/>\nall sorts of other motley children, I do &quot;allow&quot; interests and individualism <br/>\n.... All of which make me unfit as a Christian in their eyes. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo where I see the OP&#39;s point in that using the word fundie for <br/>\nfundamentalist is a slight or slur, I must object to the insinuation that its use makes for <br/>\nbigotry. Because I will be friends with you no strings attached I don&#39;t care <br/>\nif you wear a dress or not, worship trees or God or nothing. But Mary down the <br/>\nstreet won&#39;t give you or me the time of day because I have cage free kids and <br/>\nno matter what committee I join, or how often I go to church it will never be <br/>\nright or enough in her eyes. So who is the bigot?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91888,"nextTopicId":91860}}
