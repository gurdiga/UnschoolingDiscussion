I thought this was not just about schoolish stuff like administration and <br/>\nrequired credits and prerequisites, but more of a philosophical question. &quot;Do <br/>\nunschoolers need or require what schools offer?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n       Probably I am wrong about the questioner&#39;s original intent, but here&#39;s <br/>\nmy unschooling response anyway! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n       Asking what subjects school teaches and whether those subjects are <br/>\nnecessary is like asking what the Bible teaches and whether it&#39;s all needed. (Or <br/>\nfill in other sacred texts.) Do humans need and require what they purport to <br/>\nteach? <br/>\n<br/>\n       We don&#39;t go to school or church, but I can&#39;t say no.<br/>\n<br/>\n       I see truth and beauty in learning wherever it is found, in the Bible <br/>\nor school, or outside of either one. <br/>\n<br/>\n       There are strange lessons in both the Bible and school, teachings we <br/>\ncan take on faith or reject, or make of them whatever we will. <br/>\n<br/>\n       Great good and great wrong has been done in the name of both the Bible <br/>\nand school. Neither can be legally imposed on unschoolers where I live. So <br/>\nit&#39;s reasonable to say I don&#39;t need or require the Bible. I don&#39;t need or <br/>\nrequire school credits.<br/>\n<br/>\n       But none of this is quite the same as saying what&#39;s found in the Bible <br/>\n(or in school) isn&#39;t needed or required.  <br/>\n<br/>\n       In the Disciplined Mind, Howard Gardner famously proposed a public <br/>\nschool K-12 curriculum based on deep themes of &quot;truth, beauty and goodness.&quot;  I <br/>\nwould argue it closely tracks the content of the Bible in how it tries to meet <br/>\nhuman needs and requirements. <br/>\n<br/>\n       Schools teach PE and colleges often require PE credit and sports <br/>\nparticipation. There are ways to into college without a sport or PE credit, and <br/>\nplenty of other ways to enjoy physical activity and develop healthy habits of <br/>\nmind and body. So we don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; to take the school course (the course may even <br/>\nmake us hate PE! &lt;g&gt; ), but nevertheless, don&#39;t we &quot;need&quot; what it purports to <br/>\noffer us? <br/>\n<br/>\n       Researchers are demonstrating that cardiovascular training causes <br/>\nsignificant, physical changes in cognitive function. Schools required sports a <br/>\nhundred years ago in private prep schools, without benefit of the cognitive <br/>\nscience, and that tradition continues today. I hated PE in school btw. <br/>\n<br/>\n       But oxygen is good for the brain, it seems. Regardless of how we get <br/>\nit, we DO need it, and benefit more the more we get. No one can force it on us, <br/>\nbut the need for it transcends any delivery system debate.<br/>\n<br/>\n       We don&#39;t have to get our truth, beauty and goodness from a sacred text <br/>\nor from one of Gardner&#39;s schools. Unschoolers can get them a thousand ways. <br/>\nBut that&#39;s not to say we don&#39;t need or require them. :)  JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; is it needed? how much is required of each subject?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Depends on what your goal is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you want to live life, subjects aren&#39;t necessary.
