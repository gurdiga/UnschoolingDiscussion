I do think kids today in general are more <br/>\ndisrespectful. Maybe I&#39;m old fashioned but a lot of what I hear bothers me. <br/>\nWe do not allow our boys to talk down to us. We both have a wonderful sense <br/>\nof humor and do allow them to joke with us within reason. This is a hard <br/>\nissue to resolve though.
