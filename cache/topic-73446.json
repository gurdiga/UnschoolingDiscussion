However, my stance on <br/>\ncalling the boy on the carpet is mostly in reference to his physical assaults on <br/>\nher children, not childhoood bickering. The thing is, most bullies will, once <br/>\nthey have been put on notice, simply move on to some other child to hold power <br/>\nover and victimize. <br/>\n<br/>\nI definately think she should file at least incident reports. The sad thing <br/>\nis, people see that as taking time away from law enforcement, should parents <br/>\nstart calling everytime a kid acts out inappropriately. But without such <br/>\ndocumentation, should said bully actually hurt any child, there is no proof to fall <br/>\nback on. And although the police may very well be low on man-power, not our <br/>\nproblem. To protect and to serve....well these kids need protection from this <br/>\nfuture criminal. Yes, that is the second time I have referred to him as that, <br/>\nbecause as sad as it is, that&#39;s the road he is headed down. And how would Dina <br/>\nfeel if she didn&#39;t call him on it and the next time around he truly hurts her <br/>\nchildren. I don&#39;t even want to think about sexual assault, but again, he has <br/>\ndisplayed these kind of tendencies and without recourse he will simply continue <br/>\nwithout fear of retribution.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as laying it on the line, do you think this bully will attempt to <br/>\n&quot;test&quot; Dina? He very well may, in which case, Dina needs to have contacted the <br/>\npolice and have begun to document such aggression. But I still doubt he would <br/>\ntry, especially after being told he better forewarn his parents. By telling the <br/>\nkid himself to warn his parents, you put the ball back in his court, thereby <br/>\nnot risking him being possibly abused by his parents if they are told directly <br/>\nby another parent. He&#39;ll know what to do, if he tells them, then abuse may not <br/>\nbe what was this kids problem. If he DOES NOT tell them then perhaps he is <br/>\nbeing hurt by someone and putting him on notice will be enough, because he fears <br/>\nthe possibility that his parents may find out via law enforment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that I don&#39;t feel sorry for this kid in some respects, I&#39;m sure his <br/>\nlittle soul is crying out for help. By the same token though, I&#39;d never let <br/>\nany other kid be the sacrificial lamb because it is feared that he may be <br/>\nabused. Perhaps putting the childrens play on video everytime they go out would <br/>\nhelp. These things are all a pain in the hiney, but I&#39;d rather be put out a little <br/>\nthan to allow this little rat to intimidate anyone any longer. At least then <br/>\nyou could have physical proof that he is harassing and harming your kids. <br/>\nPerhaps that would be enough for a restraining order.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Help with a bully","postDate":"1055346238","msgId":73697,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMWIwMWMzMzAzMSRjMzZkZjU4MCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDE3YS4xYzA1YmIyZC4yYzE4NjZhZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":73687,"nextInTopic":73700,"prevInTime":73696,"nextInTime":73698,"topicId":73446,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

(Put aside that I am able to puke pretty readily all the time, LOL) This <br/>\nkind of thing is not what I would classify as typical school type behavior, by <br/>\nany means. Sure boys of that age tease girls, but to be bold enough to touch <br/>\nher when she has told him to back off? And to do any of these things in front of <br/>\nyou? Sorry but they&#39;d be scraping his a$$ off the pavement if it involved one <br/>\nof my daughters. And that would be after I was done with him. I don&#39;t even <br/>\nwant to contemplate what my DH would to to him and his parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course my first feeling when talking about the gun part with Kyle is that <br/>\nperhaps Elliott just craves attention and doesn&#39;t care how or who he gets it <br/>\nfrom as long as he gets it, but when the touching your daughter inappropriately <br/>\nand then actually hitting your son?  All feeling went out the window for this <br/>\nfuture criminal. I wouldn&#39;t start with the parents though. I&#39;d start with <br/>\nhim. Lay it all on the line. Tell Elliott you have already contacted the police <br/>\ndept and they are aware of his behavior and will not hesitate to haul his butt <br/>\nin if he touches any other kid on the block. I say that because he will be on <br/>\nguard then that you are not only looking out for your kids, but for the <br/>\nneighborhood as a whole. Then I&#39;d tell him he should warn his parents about my <br/>\ndiscussion with the police, so that should he screw up, they won&#39;t be shocked at <br/>\nhis arrest. And if his parents have issue with what I&#39;ve done, they can feel <br/>\nfree to come chat about it. Chances are he won&#39;t tell them and even if he did, <br/>\nthey wont seek you out. If they should seek you out, by all means do it on your <br/>\nterritory, not theirs. That way when the conversation is over for you, you can <br/>\nshut your door.<br/>\n<br/>\nBullies suck, but allowing someone to bully makes everyone involved losers. <br/>\nVictims of bullies usually stay victims, bullies depend and crave the power <br/>\nthey get from bullying and anyone who allows it to happen, is helping to create <br/>\nan unsafe world for us all.

I would bet too, that talking to his parents <br/>\nwon&#39;t do any good, and may make things worse.  Still, I feel the parents still <br/>\nneed to be warned in some or another, of the problems.  Sounds corny, but I would <br/>\nsuggest doing something like taking a loaf of homemade bread over, or a batch <br/>\nof cookies, introducing yourself, trying to at least appear friendly.  Let <br/>\nthe kid see you really do care and you&#39;re not like everyone else that will just <br/>\nrant and rave to his parents about what he&#39;s doing... <br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of letting the kid know, in a very nice way, that you see he <br/>\nis hurting or that there may be some problems in his life, but that taking it <br/>\nout on younger kids won&#39;t help.  Let him know you care enough to CALL the <br/>\npolice should you see him endangering himself or another kid.  Don&#39;t want him to <br/>\nend up in trouble and you will intervene if you see him begin to go too far. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the best part, giving him a choice...really cool, fun summer or a really <br/>\nmiserable yucky one.  All up to him, his choice.  This has worked wonders with <br/>\nour adoptive son who was totally out of control when we got him.  Kids who <br/>\nare abused or neglected feel the need to control others.

I would make it a point to be near my child and <br/>\nPHYSICALLY intervene if this bully threathened to physically harm my child (even <br/>\nan unwanted touch).  I certainly hope that your daughter is not being coerced <br/>\ninto actually giving that boy hugs!  I would have taken the toy from the bully <br/>\nwithout a word but with tangible attitude.  I would then have told the bully <br/>\nto stay away from my kids, and my yard.  If need be, I would also call the <br/>\npolice and make a report.  I understand that children need to learn to deal with <br/>\nthe world... but we don&#39;t throw a child just learning to swim into a raging <br/>\nriver.  I have absolutely no respect for bullies (this kid sounds like a full <br/>\nblown tyrant) and don&#39;t feel that it is my job to reform them.  My job is to <br/>\nraise my child in a safe environment. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that the immediate situation is over and the above is water under the <br/>\nbridge, I would tell my children that they are not allowed to even speak with <br/>\nthis boy.  Not because my kids are &quot;not allowed&quot;, but because I can&#39;t really tell <br/>\nsomeone elses kid what they can or can&#39;t do, but I can tell my kids that they <br/>\nhave a &quot;rule&quot;  (what a novelty in my home... and amazing how well they &quot;like&quot; <br/>\nrules that are &quot;for&quot; them).  The next time the kid comes by, have your kids <br/>\ntell the bully that they are not allowed to play with him.  And when the bully <br/>\ncomes and tries to stay anyway  (gee, has this actually happened to me?... <br/>\nummm... yes...), I would (already being the protective mother bear and seeing it <br/>\nas it happens) tell the kid to get lost myself.  If he refuses, I would ask <br/>\nthe kid for his phone number and tell him I am calling his parents to come get <br/>\nhim, or tell him I will call the police to have him removed from my property.  <br/>\nIf he still stays, I would then proceed to call his parents and/or the police. <br/>\n (I actually walked across the street and told the kids mom that my child is <br/>\nnot allowed to play with her kids and to please make sure they stay out of my <br/>\nyard ... the parents are actually nice enough people).<br/>\n<br/>\nI also feel that tho your kids may feel somewhat embarrassed by being <br/>\n&quot;protected&quot;, I am rather certain that most (if not all) of the other victims will be <br/>\nsilently (if not shouting it right outloud) applauding and rooting for you and <br/>\nyour kids.  In addition, I think that once you put your foot down and make it <br/>\nclear that you will not tolerate your children being bullied, it will <br/>\ndiminish, tho perhaps not disappear entirely.  I would tell my child to simply ignore <br/>\nwhatever is said... what kind of credibilty does one accord a bully anyway?  <br/>\nI would also convey to my child that it is more than ok for a parent to <br/>\nprotect a child... in my opinion, thats part of what we&#39;re here for!  I would also <br/>\nlet my child know that this bully has his own issues and that he is using <br/>\ncalling my child a &quot;baby&quot; as a tool to empower himself.  Thus keeping my child in <br/>\nthe position of being a victim rather than calling for (or just accepting) the <br/>\nhelp my child needs to defend himself.

So I&#39;m wondering how I should handle it?***<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a boy like that in our neighborhood.   All the parents warned us<br/>\nabout him when he moved in across the street.  They knew him from school.<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I saw the bullying for myself I told him he was only welcome to be<br/>\nin our yard (on our stuff) and near Dylan if he could be nice.   I<br/>\ndefined nice for him in case he didn&#39;t have a good definition, and he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I later found out about his family was that he hadn&#39;t lived with is<br/>\nparents much, but had been shipped around to different relatives, mainly<br/>\ngrandparents.   He was in special ed classes at school and knew the<br/>\nteachers didn&#39;t like him.   His mother was terrible to him and would lock<br/>\nhim out of the house after school so he &quot;wouldn&#39;t eat everything&quot;.   She<br/>\nyelled a lot and called him stupid.   Maybe the parents hit, I never saw,<br/>\nbut I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was BAD family business at their house in April.   The parents were<br/>\nfighting a lot and twice the younger boy came running to our house saying<br/>\nthey were trying to kill each other.   One night he came over and said<br/>\nhis mom was bleeding.    She had gone into the bathroom and come out with<br/>\na razor blade and slit her wrists in front of her family.   Her kids are<br/>\nseven and twelve. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids have been sent to live with the grandparents again. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis ramble was meant to warn you that the reason the kid is a bully<br/>\nmight be the parents.   It may do you no good to talk with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nTry to talk to Elliot.   Tell him you&#39;re sorry if people have been mean<br/>\nto him but you won&#39;t let him be mean to your kids.  That&#39;s it.  And tell<br/>\nhim what you&#39;ll do if he is.  Tell him you&#39;ll call the police.   Talk<br/>\nwith other parents on your street and form an alliance.   Let him know<br/>\nevery adult will be watching him and if he&#39;s mean to kids you&#39;ll find out<br/>\nand take action.  You don&#39;t have to be menacing, just explain how it&#39;s<br/>\ngoing to be and that he has the power to make it a nice, fun summer or a<br/>\nyucky one. <br/>\nThat he does things right in front of you seems like action to get adult<br/>\nattention to me.  He&#39;s probably starved.    If talking with him seems to<br/>\nslow down or stop the bullying, and you&#39;ll maybe have to talk to him<br/>\nevery day, then try demonstrating kindness to him.  It might help.  He<br/>\nmight not be getting any at home. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to keep your kids safe.  He won&#39;t stop if he thinks no one cares<br/>\nor no one WILL stop him.  Make sure he knows you will. <br/>\nThis worked for us with our bully.   I actually liked the poor kid and<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry he was shipped away.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sad for you because it can be really painful getting a glimpse into<br/>\nthe life of a desperate kid like this.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Help with a bully","postDate":"1055262748","msgId":73486,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGUwMWMzMmY2ZCRlMjY5NTM0MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDAwNjAwMWMzMmY1NyQxMGNjNzFjMCQwMTAxYThjMEBwYXZpbGlvbj4="},"prevInTopic":73485,"nextInTopic":73487,"prevInTime":73485,"nextInTime":73487,"topicId":73446,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: The Clifton s  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1467005016\">From: &quot;The Clifton&#39;s&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rpclif14@...\">rpclif14@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;After discussing this all tonight, Kyle says that he wants me to intervene<br/>\nnow.

They could advise on <br/>\npeacekeeping strategies, and on what the laws are about assault among kids.

We moved into this house mid-February and right from the beginning my kids knew who the bully was on the street. The other kids had warned my kids. The bully is named Elliot and he will be 13 next month. This kid is a walking hormone also. The first time I saw the intimidation going on I jumped in the middle of it and stopped it. But my husband said he thought Kyle was handling it and I shouldn&#39;t have intervened. So we had a talk with Kyle and he said he didn&#39;t want me to interfere anymore. So I have been respecting that request ever since. One of the things that has been bothering me though is that Elliot will tease, push, hit and take away toys from Kyle with me standing outside watching it all happen. I find this to be very disrespectful but Elliot does whatever he wants in front of whoever. Just to be clear, Kyle does know that if asks me for help I will help in heartbeat. It seems that this has come to a head for me today. Kyle was letting one of the other boys (Elliot&#39;s 10 yr old brother) play with one of his toy guns and Elliot took it away. Kyle asked for it back several times and was getting frustrated. I said to Elliot &quot; Kyle asked for his gun back, will you please give it back to him?&quot;  Elliot acted like he was going to give it back then switched it to his other hand to tease Kyle. He got in Kyle&#39;s face and said something to him. He then gave the gun back and pushed Kyle so Kyle hit him back. Elliot punched Kyle in the arm pretty hard and walked away. Kyle started saying &quot;I&#39;m not a baby&quot; and then started yelling &quot;I&#39;m not a baby&quot;(evidently that is what Elliot had said to Kyle).  Meanwhile, Elliot was across the street still mouthing &quot;baby&quot; at Kyle. Kyle got so angry and was loosing control of himself. He was screaming &quot;I&#39;m not a baby&quot; and then began to cry. I think sometimes Kyle scares himself when he gets past his boiling point so to speak. The teasing didn&#39;t stop. Elliot continued to mouth stuff at Kyle from across the street until Kyle went into the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for background info, Elliot chases Caitlin around and won&#39;t quit when she tells him to. He pushes her and is way too rough with her and another girl on the street. He kisses at her. He asks for a hug all the time. She says she hates him and doesn&#39;t want to be around him. She tries to ignore him when all the kids are outside playing. Elliot picks on Kyle everyday that they are all outside playing. Kyle is afraid of Elliot. Kyle and I have talked about this situation many times. Kyle feels more confident when I am outside and he will defend himself more. But that only causes Elliot to hit Kyle harder or push him down.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter discussing this all tonight, Kyle says that he wants me to intervene now. So I&#39;m wondering how I should handle it? I don&#39;t want whatever I do to cause Elliot to then sneak behind everyone&#39;s back to bully my son. Maybe that is inevitable, I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<br/>\nDina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74013,"nextTopicId":73978}}
