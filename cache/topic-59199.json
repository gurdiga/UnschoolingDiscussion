We all take breaks and get tired of things and get interested in <br/>\nother things and get side-tracked. Let him play until he has his fill. THEN <br/>\nhe&#39;ll surprise you by asking to do something you NEVER thought he would. But <br/>\nyou&#39;ll have to give him the time HE needs to get the game out of his system. <br/>\nIt&#39;s a trust thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost all of us have been through this. As adults, it&#39;s allowed. We can read <br/>\nor clean or watch TV or garden or paint or shop to our heart&#39;s content. But <br/>\nchildren don&#39;t get the opportunity to get their fill of something---there are <br/>\nALWAYS limits! Trust your smart, sweet boy to play as long as he needs to. <br/>\nIt&#39;ll pass.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59131,"nextTopicId":59127}}
