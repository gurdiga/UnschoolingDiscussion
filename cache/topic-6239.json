So I have been reading everything I can get my hands on.  I was baptised Catholic, attended both Catholic and Methodist churches growing up.  I also once went to a Baptist church.  Since I&#39;ve been married I&#39;ve gone to Luthern and non-denominational churches.  These religions just don&#39;t speak to me.  I&#39;ve started learning about the Wiccans and am very impressed with how natural their religions are.  Though I&#39;m not an expert and am still learning myself, I could send you a reading list if you&#39;re interested.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Free voicemail and email, by phone or Web!

Basically do unto to others as you would have done unto yourself.  My favorite though is the wiccan creed which is &quot;An&#39; it harm none, do what thou wilt&quot;.  I prefer this because you are included in the none.  Do what you want as long as it doesn&#39;t hurt you or anyone else.  I encourage my children when we encounter difficult situations to not only &quot;walk a mile in the other persons shoes&quot; but to also examine how they are feeling.  Parents now encourage children to &quot;use their words&quot; but they don&#39;t help them find the words for their feelings.  I&#39;m not worried about social conformity...in fact it doesn&#39;t even enter my mind.  I just keep my goal for my children in mind at all times.  I want them to be happy, healthy adults.  This means that they will need to learn many things, not only mentally but also emotionally.  So I just follow my heart and hope for the best.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Free voicemail and email, by phone or Web!  Free phone calls too!
