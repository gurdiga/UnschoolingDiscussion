I don&#39;t want to mess anything<br/>\nup legally with the paperwork.  My friend told me about Help U Sell<br/>\nreal estate and I have someone coming over today to tell us about how<br/>\nit works.  Basicly they charge a set fee (about $3000) to market our<br/>\nhome and do all of the paperwork with us but we show the home.  After<br/>\nbeing quoted up to $11,000 (depending on what we sell the house for)<br/>\n$3000 sounded really good.  I then got an email from a local real<br/>\nestate office who does something similar and I&#39;m going to call them to<br/>\nfind out what their fee is. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was just wondering if any of you had either sold their home<br/>\nthemselves (and what was involved) or is you had used Help U Sell or<br/>\nsomething similar and where you happy with the results?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74153,"nextTopicId":74160}}
