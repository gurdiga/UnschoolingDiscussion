My children have never been in school and  are 1, 3, 5 and 7.<br/>\nBefore I had children I was such a careerist. I spent a decade in film and<br/>\ntv production. I&#39;ve spent the last 8 years pregnant or nursing.  I&#39;m now<br/>\nfinding myself feeling ready to move back out into the world more. My older<br/>\nchildren are starting to feel that way too I think. I&#39;ve put wordly<br/>\nambitions on the back burner and I&#39;m starting to feel like the walls of<br/>\nthis house are closing in on me at times.  (Could be the end of winter<br/>\ncabin fever too)  I&#39;m now wondering if there is a way to begin stepping<br/>\nback out into the world more as a family. Kind of like the Partridge<br/>\nFamily. Either through a family buisness or project that can serve others. <br/>\n<br/>\n        <br/>\nWe are all musically inclinded, my husband&#39;s a physician, my background is<br/>\nin media and the healing arts.  So we&#39;ll have to see what evolves as our<br/>\nfamily grows.  Are there any stories out there of families out there<br/>\nliving/working/learning together in freedom? <br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to hearing from you.

My husband and I just wrote a book called &quot;Healing at Home&quot;  that is<br/>\naccompanied by a  companion  Healing Kit.

I have not<br/>\nbeen  working in the studio for a year.  I used to try to do it all--make<br/>\nstuff,  do kids, , do the house. One November day(gray in NE Ohio), I found<br/>\nmyself sitting at the kitchen table, with newspapers, dishes, stuff, and my<br/>\nenergy piled up all over the place--we had been out all day and had arrived<br/>\nhome at about 6pm.  There i was, sipping Rescue Remedy, and realizing that<br/>\nthat was nuts!!!  I din&#39;t need to do it all. So my husband and I decided<br/>\nthat her would do the studio/business unlesss something was going to cost a<br/>\nlot of money--then we&#39;d decide together--and i would do the home stuff. then<br/>\n2 yrs ago my mother and grandmother were very ill at the same time(and died<br/>\nwithin 5 weeks of each other).So that became our focus for a while.<br/>\n We often talk about parenting as the most important &quot;job&quot;--that years from<br/>\nnow, no one will care about the business--but the legacy of healthy kids<br/>\nwill endure.   Do I miss working in the studio? Sure I do at times.  But<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried crazy and I don&#39;t like it at all.  My daughter and I made a<br/>\nporcelain tile last year, which we called Generations--it represented the 4<br/>\ngenerations of women that we had had in the family.  I&#39;d like to do moreo of<br/>\nthis kind of thing with my kids.<br/>\n  Today we&#39;re going to an coop--I&#39;m going to explore hands-on art history<br/>\nwith a bunch of kids.<br/>\n  Debra<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Winifred Haun + Dancers&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wini@...\">wini@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, February 10, 2000 11:36 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Career moms<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Winifred Haun + Dancers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wini@...\">wini@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Do you think it&#39;s more &quot;natural&quot; for women to feel this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;way than men?
