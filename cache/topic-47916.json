The <br/>\nexception would be children under 7 on a scooter with an adult <br/>\npresent.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst offense, fine and confiscation of scooter or skateboard for 90 <br/>\ndays.  Second offense, fine and confiscation for 180 days.  Third <br/>\noffense scooter or skateboard is destroyed and fine is $300.  After <br/>\nthe first offense, parents can be arrested for allowing their <br/>\nchildren for riding the skateboard or skooter.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter and I have been walking the streets of our town getting <br/>\npetitions signed.  We&#39;ve found that each block takes a little over an <br/>\nhour. We figured out how much time we would have to put in each day <br/>\nin order to finish on time.  That required some math.  We printed up <br/>\ncontact information for people who sign our petition urging them to <br/>\ncontact the mayor and council members.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the first 4 blocks, we realized that the majority of people are <br/>\nagainst the ordinance. We thought it would be good to keep track of <br/>\nhow many against and how many for.  Then, we&#39;ll figure out the <br/>\npercentage for and against and add that to our case. Maybe make up a <br/>\nlittle graph.   My daughter is writing a letter, I&#39;m writing a <br/>\nletter, we&#39;re sending each council member copies of our petitions--<br/>\nwe&#39;re hoping for 500 signatures--and we&#39;re showing up at the <br/>\nmeeting.  Maybe I&#39;ll send them cute pictures of my kids standing with <br/>\ntheir scooters and skateboards.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI figure this will be good for civics, math, and language arts to put <br/>\nin the homeschool portfolio at the end of the year!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else have any other ideas of what we can do?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48078,"nextTopicId":48124}}
