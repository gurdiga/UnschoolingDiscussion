However, the girl was really good and it worked out great....but<br/>\noften it is just perception on the part of the director - or whoever is<br/>\ndoing the casting. I do think the suggestion of calling the director is good<br/>\nas well - but I would venture to guess that it is not that your daughter did<br/>\na poor audition - but just that there was someone else who the director<br/>\nthought fit the role....<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we did audition for Ramona - my daughter was not offered a major part<br/>\nbut was in the children&#39;s ensemble. I thought she would be really<br/>\ndisappointed but overall was just happy being part of the play. I imagine<br/>\nthat if she tried three times and didn&#39;t get a major part she would be<br/>\ndisappointed - just like your daughter. When I was in high school this<br/>\nhappened to me because I had a major role, and then the next play didn&#39;t get<br/>\none. I just assumed it was me - and I never auditioned again - until Ramona.<br/>\nI think the perspective I have of the whole process as an adult is not the<br/>\nsame as I had when I was a teen. I totally internalized at that time, but<br/>\nnow I can see that it wasn&#39;t me per se - but that I didn&#39;t fit the roles.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope your daughter will try again - or try with another theater!! And tell<br/>\nher to make sure she doesn&#39;t wait 20 years like I did! I missed a lot of<br/>\nfun!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Paula Sjogerman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sjogy@...\">sjogy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 11, 2006 4:39 PM<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Disappointment<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Jan 11, 2006, at 3:30 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jackie auditioned for a play last night.
