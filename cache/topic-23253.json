Her daily &quot;tantrums&quot; <br/>\n would last an hour or more, with her hypervenilating and sobbing &quot;I can&#39;t <br/>\n stop, help me stop.&quot; They often occured several times a day. Oh, how <br/>\n stressful! She&#39;s six now, and I still have to keep a close eye to know when <br/>\n she&#39;s overloaded. She&#39;s never been diagnosed with anything, and I prefer it <br/>\n that way, but my suspicions are that she has Sensory Integration Disorder. <br/>\n We&#39;ve removed dyes, etc., added cherry plum bach flower essences, etc., and <br/>\n they all helped, but didn&#39;t stop them.

We also limit sugar but <br/>\nnot too much b/c then it becomes something to sneak. What does the cherry <br/>\nplum bach flower do for your dd. I use rescue remedy for somehtings. I also <br/>\ntried Calm Child,no difference. I also tried childrens Valerian for <br/>\nbedtime(big troubles calming down to go to sleep) never worked. I would like <br/>\nher to take liquid Cal/Mag but the battle could be worse than the benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\n   She will start w/ I can&#39;t stop moving,I can&#39;t fall asleep, then she gets <br/>\nupset and her nose stuffs up and watch out your in for a ride. If you tell <br/>\nher to take it easy or settle down she skyrockets ever more,this happens w/ a <br/>\nsimple fit during the day too. Last night I went around closing windows and <br/>\ndoors b/c she was fitting over something. I rode it out and she was fine in a <br/>\nbit. The other night dh came home form walking the dog and heard her starting <br/>\nw/ the nose thing,he silently walked back out and walked her some more. It <br/>\nmakes us tense too. Tough call as to soothe and calm or shut up and ride it <br/>\nout. Sometimes soothing makes it worse in her case.<br/>\n<br/>\n    NICKI~</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Nanci Kuykendall &lt;aisliin@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"YE11e-G7j8P2cabzp9F_CuOyzxiV8vn01Vq0MBNfTuEcQEvWKiIFBUn2Ekx31IEaeGO35o5dyEH1Tdov4DP4MRmQqv9vJ_89lxC-","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1362","postDate":"997731161","msgId":23253,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwODEzMTkzMjQxLjY3MzgyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzNzA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk5NzY5NDIzOC42MzcuMTcxNy5sMTBAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23363,"prevInTime":23252,"nextInTime":23254,"topicId":23253,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... needs guidance on how to ground himself and come back ...

Thomas is<br/>\nhyperactive, hypersensative and we suspect SID, among<br/>\nother things.  However, he has not been diagnosed with<br/>\nanything in any way other than through my own<br/>\nresearch.  We do know that he has asthma and multiple<br/>\nallergy problems, including eggs, dairy, additives and<br/>\npreservatives, nuts and other things.  I sometimes<br/>\nwonder how much of his behavioral issues might be<br/>\nrelated to undiagnosed allergies we have yet to<br/>\ndiscover and we are looking into getting him some<br/>\ncomprehensive allergy testing once we get settled into<br/>\nthe Tri Cities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too have to hold him a lot when he gets really<br/>\nworked up, talk to him softly and explain over and<br/>\nover what is and is not appropriate behavior.  I also<br/>\ntry to make him aware of the consequences of his<br/>\nbehavior.  Last month he nearly chopped off the end of<br/>\nhis baby brother&#39;s pinky finger (needing stitches)<br/>\nwhile rough-housing with the shower door and refusing<br/>\nto mind when asked repeatedly to stop.  I made a point<br/>\nof making it VERY clear to him that he was responsible<br/>\nfor his brother&#39;s injury, so that he understood the<br/>\nresults of his actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also does not adjust well to changes in his<br/>\nroutine, and his behavior has been exhausting and<br/>\ntrying the last week, as we are in the middle of<br/>\nmoving and are staying with my brother and his family<br/>\n(incluing Thomas&#39; favorite hyper/sensative mirror<br/>\nimage girl cousin who is 2 months younger than him.) <br/>\nThe two of them are quite a handfull, even without all<br/>\nthe other kids.  Since I am here alone and my husband<br/>\nis still closing up the house and taking care of his<br/>\njob transfer in Idaho, I am really tired, to put it<br/>\nmildly.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
