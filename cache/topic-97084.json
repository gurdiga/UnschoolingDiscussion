The medical field is <br/>\ndeficit based care.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure that others have lots of suggestions on fun things that <br/>\ntheir children like to do with their hands. Fine motor skills are the <br/>\nsame whether they are for something your child wants to do or because <br/>\nsomeone thinks your child NEEDS to learn how to do something. I <br/>\nbelieve that my child will learn how to do things that he needs or <br/>\nfind a different way to meet the need. I don&#39;t want him to feel that <br/>\nhe failed to learn something someone else thinks he NEEDS. I am all <br/>\nfor fun ideas to strew for my son to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvaluation means judging against someone&#39;s measure of right.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, emma bovary <br/>\n&lt;e_bovary@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I have a five-year-old son who&#39;s very intelligent and creative.
