I was watching<br/>\nnatural learning happen with Jonathan and it was so fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was adding numbers together and telling me the answers, for him its a<br/>\ngame, as fun as any other NON-academic game.  Later he was playing Pokemon<br/>\non the gameboy, when he would catch a new Pokemon he would have to name it.<br/>\nHe would ask for the letters for the name he had chosen, after the first two<br/>\nhe was picking out some of the letters himself by sounding them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he uses the computer he has several favorite web sites like cartoon<br/>\nnetwork, Disney and nickelodeon.  He types the urls in himself with help<br/>\nfrom me or Lanora, already hes learning how some of the words are spelled.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of this surprises me anymore but it always thrills me to see the kids<br/>\nexperience learning as pure fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83387,"nextTopicId":83642}}
