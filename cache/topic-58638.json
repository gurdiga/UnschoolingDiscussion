I will definitely stop<br/>\n&gt; throwing temper tantrums around here.. Gosh, I&#39;ve broken 5 sewing machines, 3<br/>\n&gt; microwaves,  and 3 mixers in just the past 6 months.. I also wrecked my car<br/>\n&gt; and punched out my window.   I attacked my husband and tried to choke him,<br/>\n&gt; then I kicked him in the groin last night.  I yelled at my kids and called<br/>\n&gt; them no-good fuckers and said they were worthless and they ruined my life. .<br/>\n&gt; Just a few days ago the bread I was making didnt turn out right so I trashed<br/>\n&gt; the whole god damned oven.  Do  you think, when I couldnt get my on loan lap<br/>\n&gt; top from school   to come on and I smashed it to the floor and stomped on it,<br/>\n&gt; could that have been a bad example?  You know, I never realized how my<br/>\n&gt; behavior could affect my kids .  What an insight.. So, do you think, if I<br/>\n&gt; stop behaving like this, my sons will stop too??   Maybe its worth a try.<br/>\n&gt; You know, I really thought you didnt like me, how paranoid of me..  I really<br/>\n&gt; need to work on not being so schizo and afraid that folks are against me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If it works in Doddville, it MUST work here too.. Thanks again<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m aware this was all sarcastic, but in awhile when you&#39;re calm, think<br/>\nabout the fact that the above is indeed the adult version of a temper<br/>\ntantrum, thrown here on the list, in response to frustration over an issue<br/>\nthat you are having a hard time dealing with.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra&#39;s point is illustrated: how you react is how your children are likely<br/>\nto react. They just do it on a 7 and 11 year old level rather than a grown<br/>\nwoman level, as in the above.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58632,"nextTopicId":58639}}
