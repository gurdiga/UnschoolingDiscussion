The kids have been <br/>\nbouncing non-stop all day, even the 12 year old is into it!  It&#39;s <br/>\none of those inflatable bounce houses like you see set up in <br/>\nsomeones yard for birthday parties, maybe a bit smaller (but still <br/>\npretty big), nice construction, lots of fun.  We bought it from Home <br/>\nShopping Network (HSN.com, listed under Holiday Gifts, Kids).  It <br/>\nwas $149, but you can extend the payments out over 4 months ($37/mo) <br/>\nand free shipping.  We were so excited about it we couldn&#39;t wait <br/>\ntill Christmas, hehe!  Hopefully no more long faces as they pass by <br/>\nthe birthday parties now...they can have a birthday party everyday <br/>\nin the backyard.  Check it out at www.hsn.com.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nCyndi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100949,"nextTopicId":100913}}
