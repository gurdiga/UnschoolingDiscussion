There are no quick trips to the store. <br/>\nYou get used to the driving though. It&#39;s well worth living in the country. As <br/>\nmy husband says, &quot;You can piss off your balcony without your neighbor giving <br/>\nyou grief (I think he did this once just to say he did it).&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re right about the overnights. All my daughter&#39;s friends are 30 to 45 <br/>\nminutes away. In fact pretty much everything is this far away. I don&#39;t even <br/>\nthink of it most of the time, just factor in the driving time when we&#39;re <br/>\n&quot;going to town.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times though that I wish there were kids close by. My son has one <br/>\nfriend about 5 minutes away, but my daughter has no one nearby. One year we <br/>\nactually had a neighbor with a daughter. What a great year for Carly. <br/>\nUnfortunately the next year the girl went to middle school and wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nassociate with my elementary aged daughter (they were only 1 1/2 years apart <br/>\nin age) anymore. AGH! Ah well, so we drive a lot (sports practices, play <br/>\npractices, voice lessons, homeschool group, friends houses, etc.). <br/>\n<br/>\nAny unschoolers want to move to beautiful central VA? Builders are putting in <br/>\nlarge acre homes on a recently purchased farm across the street. They don&#39;t <br/>\nseem to be destroying the woods. <br/>\n<br/>\nEnough rambling,<br/>\nGinny  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57735,"nextTopicId":57921}}
