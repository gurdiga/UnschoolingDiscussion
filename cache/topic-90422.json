Then I&#39;m a clock; then he&#39;s a cow.  We play variations on 20 <br/>\nquestions (What letter am I?  What number am I thinking of?

It sounds familiar in several areas.  Especially the cuddling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSadly enough, my mother in law pointed out to me that my relationship with Madison was suffering.  It killed me when I realized she was right.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is such a cool kid.  They all are.  I mean, they blow me away on a daily basis.  However, I had become so caught up in &quot;fitting him into the mold&quot; that I was bordering on being angry with him for not being the &quot;Stepford Student&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know exactly why I&#39;m here.  It&#39;s for &quot;Fellowship&quot;...and as a bit of a comfort zone when I feel like I need to say &quot;Oh please help me!!!&quot;  So far, the latter hasn&#39;t come up.  All I&#39;ve needed to do was to say &quot;What a wonderful day!!!&quot;  Sometimes, a person just needs to surround themselves with other like-minded people.  That&#39;s me.  I just wish there were more unschoolers in my immediate area.  We have one unschooler and one &quot;eclectic&quot; homeschooler...so I guess I&#39;m pretty lucky to have those.<br/>\n<br/>\nI, too, have noticed that there are a lot of people that ask the repeat questions that are available.  I had a lot of the same concerns.  I was worried about him playing video games all day...until I read a little more on the subject and saw the questions answered.  Now I say &quot;Let him play...he&#39;s learning&quot;.  Most importantly, our relationship is blossoming and he&#39;s going to gear himself to what he needs/wants to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was growing up, I was a &quot;daydreamer&quot;.  My daughter is much the same and always getting told she just &quot;Doesn&#39;t do her work&quot;...well of course she doesn&#39;t...she&#39;s got big dreams.  She wants to think about those dreams and figure out how to make them come true.  Where is that wrong?  When I grew up, it took me forever to pin down what I wanted to do with my life.  I&#39;m just getting started on it.  Why?  Because the system squelched my ability to discover myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;ll stop rambling now.  What I was trying to say, in a nutshell, was that I really appreciate your story and thanks for sharing it :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:arcarpenter@...\">arcarpenter@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, February 06, 2004 11:53 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Good moments and how unschoolers learn (long)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Most of the day was just hanging out, watching TV.
