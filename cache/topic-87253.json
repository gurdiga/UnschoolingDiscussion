My 2yo has been in a lot lately which I have <br/>\nno probelm with except no one wakes up happy.  It is amazing how <br/>\nmuch room that little body takes up!  He tends to push me to the <br/>\nedge and kick my dh.  However, he tends to come in when I am dead <br/>\nasleep so by the time I realize he is there I am too tired to do <br/>\nanything about it.  Once he is asleep, and if I have the energy I <br/>\nwill put him back in his bed.  My 5yo will come in occasionaly, <br/>\nescpecially if he wakes up and finds his brother gone.  We just <br/>\nbought one of those new airbed sleeping bags and leave it next to <br/>\nthe bed.  He comes in when he needs and plops and he is <br/>\ncomfortable.  I wish I had thought of it sooner.
