As a child, she had won a (mandatory) essay<br/>\ncontest in school, I think it was something along the lines of &quot;Why I love<br/>\nGermany&quot;. The prize was that she got to go on a train trip to a big banquet<br/>\nand meet Hitler. What struck me as most interesting is that they had been so<br/>\nimpoverished for so long (remember the huge pre-war depression in Germany)<br/>\nthat almost all she remembers of the entire trip was that they had *real*<br/>\noranges at the banquet.<br/>\n<br/>\nViggo Mortensen: I used to be in a punk rock band and also helped put on<br/>\nshows when touring punk bands came to my town.
