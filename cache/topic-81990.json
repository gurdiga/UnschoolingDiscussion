We just use them as suggestions, not like following <br/>\nthier curriculum, but they have some very good suggestions for great reading.  We <br/>\nuse the lists just as suggestions for reading, we dont just pick from one <br/>\n&quot;level&quot;   Some of the books are very familar titles, but many of them I had never <br/>\nheard of.    It&#39;s great to go to the library and just pick out books, and we <br/>\ndo that alot.. But, sometimes it gets overwhelming trying to choose.
