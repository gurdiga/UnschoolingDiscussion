As far as making any of my family members uncomfortable because they&#39;re different shades than I am, that&#39;s not happened.  Yes I let them know that they&#39;re themselves and I wouldn&#39;t change them, and I welcome the &#39;diversity&#39; that they bring.<br/>\n <br/>\nChildrens remarks dont bother me.  When my youngest was newborn, and I&#39;d take both kids somewhere, and could hear kids asking their moms about my kids, the ones I appreciated were the moms who would say, &#39;look how lucky they are! They have a beautiful baby, and that little girl has new baby sister!&#39;  This was great for me, because my first child had jealousy issues at first, and when she&#39;d hear that stuff, I think it made her realize that siblings could be a good thing.<br/>\n.....they quietly asked me something, that was better, but, it isn&#39;t any <br/>\nbusiness of a perfect stranger to find out why my middle daughter might <br/>\nlook different than her sisters, so any questions by strangers are <br/>\nrude, imo. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
