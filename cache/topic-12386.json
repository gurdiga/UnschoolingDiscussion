In","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1723949803\">Well, this is what happened. Last night DS and DH were at bil&#39;s <br/>\nhouse, DH&#39;s brother. DS was eating an apple when he noticed his tooth <br/>\nwas loose and told DH. In the past DS has forgotten to brush his <br/>\nteeth, as any normal 5yo does, and we always ask him if he has done <br/>\nthis. DH has also told DS that if you don&#39;t brush your teeth you will <br/>\nloose them. I have gone back and clarified this statement to DS but <br/>\nit has been a while and at the time I never dreamed that it would <br/>\ncause him this much worry or I would have persued it more deeply with <br/>\nhim. Anyway, I guess DH thought that his tooth was loose because DS <br/>\nforgets to brush occasionally and that this weakened the tooth to the <br/>\npoint that the apple was too hard for the tooth to handle and <br/>\nloosened it. This is what he told DS. This a.m. DS and I had a good <br/>\nconversation about loosing his baby teeth and I explained the process <br/>\nto him. When I told him about the Tooth Fairy his response was, &quot;A <br/>\nwhole quarter?!?!?!&quot; I think he feels better about it now. This <br/>\nafternoon DH was still convinced that it was the lack of brushing <br/>\nthat caused the tooth to become loose. BTW DS had all of his teeth by <br/>\n1yo. He started drooling profusely at 2.5-3mo and cut his first tooth <br/>\nat 4-5mo and cut them till he had the same number as he did months <br/>\nthen cut 1-2 a month till he was 12mo. This sounds like it was a very <br/>\ndifficult time, as is usually the case, however, the only symptom he <br/>\nhad was the drooling and a cold/runny nose the weekend prior to the <br/>\nteeth cutting in.
