We&#39;ve all found some OTC stuff <br/>\nthat works on some things and some homeopathics (and mixed remedies <br/>\nwhich are sort of frowned on by some) that work for other things. <br/>\nThe Chestal cough stuff (the kid kind in a honey base) is just <br/>\nwonderful - we all like it. I know many homepathic remedies would be <br/>\ndifficult for some since they often (generally?) have an alcohol <br/>\nbase. DS (Just turned 7) know which stuff he wants, and when and how <br/>\nmuch he should take. He is probably the last one to take anything <br/>\nsince his preferred remedy for most anything is chicken noodle soup <br/>\nand a long nap in our bed with the remote handy if he wants to watch <br/>\nTV. I was quite happy to find the homeopathic head cold blend remedy <br/>\nbecause most medications (even plain old Tylenol) tend to make me <br/>\nsleepy - even the non-drowsy stuff! (Of course, more than 2 cups of <br/>\nanything caffeinated will do the same thing or one strong glass of <br/>\nwine). So, to find something that clears the symptoms AND allows me <br/>\nto not burn all my sick days at work is a wonderful thing.

The people I work with laugh at me and the coffee thing, but they drink the brown water from the dining room. I need my coffee... I miss Peet&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also carry Fioricet for mihgraines and take them whenever my head starts to hurt - I&#39;d rather treat something that would have gone away by itself than risk a full-blown migraine - and I encourage my daughter to take pseudoephedrine and chlorpheniramine for a stuffy nose or allergy symptoms (and I take them myself). When I was a kid, the medicine cabinet was sacrosanct, but Rain knows what to take for various things and does so... she reads labels more carefully than I do, and there&#39;s never been a problem... and this has been going on for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n<br/>\n-- &quot;April M&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abmorris23@...\">abmorris23@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nOh, you&#39;re not alone Ann!
