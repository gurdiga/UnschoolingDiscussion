But I know it isn&#39;t my sister in law because she only just heard the concept of  &quot;unschooling&quot; two days ago and hasn&#39;t had internet access where she is staying.  Today I brought she and her kids with mine to our park day we do with a few other hschoolers - not unschoolers but very layed back moms.  One is a la leche league leader.  Having so many easy going happy children and moms around seemed to completely influence my SILs style.  Or maybe it was the talk we had last night.

I so depend on this list to know I am not alone sometimes.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI ended up telling my SIL my reservations about the way in which she controls her kids  by putting so much extra work on them on top of their actual school curriculum.  I did my best to explain what I have been learning, thinking about, experiencing - about &quot;learning&quot;.  I don&#39;t know how much of it she understood but she really did listen and we had a good conversation - at least if felt good to calmly be honest.  She thinks that her children appreciate being pushed by her to do extra work so they don&#39;t feel so behind in school.  She even thinks that her daughter appreciates being pushed to eat (she is eight and has never eaten without her mother there nagging her to eat more!) or pushed to try things the daughter &quot;claims&quot; she doesn&#39;t want to do.  Sigh.  I am glad that I held myself back from any passionate reactions.  Small seeds planted, maybe...  I did see wheels turning in her head.  I have been positively surprised lately by some friends&#39;/family&#39;s reactions to what we are doing.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs far as my kids and this weekend, I think they are actually going to have a good time.  The SIL is leaving on Thurs. and DH will always be with them to run interference with the troublesome, competitive cousin. And aside from him, the others are really good kids. I think they will have a blast on a farm without mom&#39;s boundaries.  Plus there is a dinosaur gala at the museum!  My 3 yo paleontologist is going dressed in a triceratops costume that I am making for him ( Hope the papier mache head dress is dry in time).<br/>\n <br/>\nYes, I am sooo excited about &quot;immersing&quot; myself in unschooling community and in unschooling wisdom, live and in person. It will be easier for me to absorb everything w/out my kids.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThey will all come with me next time though.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMadeline <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\nIn a message dated 8/19/2003 2:25:04 PM Mountain Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:davenshan@...\">davenshan@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I wish they were going to the conf. with me.<br/>\n&gt; They wanted to stay here to be with their cousins.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The conference is short, and cousins are forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantages they would get from being around unschooled kids might make <br/>\nyour whole life better and theirs too.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if you go kid-free you can really immerse yourself, and <br/>\nmaybe when you get back they&#39;ll be tired of cousins anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly has learned a lot about how not to be by being around more structured <br/>\nhomeschoolers.

They are visiting for two weeks on their way to move to NY.  My 6 yr.<br/>\nold is over there now with them for breakfast and because he goes to the<br/>\nfarm, where DH works and where MILs house is, many mornings to farm.  I<br/>\ncalled to see if they wanted to go swim with my 3 yo and I or have us come<br/>\nthere to play.  MIL informed me that we had to wait to ask SIL until her<br/>\nfamily meeting with the kids was over and then until work time was over.<br/>\nThe &quot;family meeting&quot; is about informing the kids to stop saying &quot;kaka and<br/>\nPee&quot; (French for poop and pee) and to stop laughing, etc. at meals.  I know<br/>\nmy 6yo has been talking about poop lately and he def. laughs a lot!  I saw<br/>\nthe whole scenario last night when they were all here for dinner and it was<br/>\nso not a big deal.  Actually, I was seeing her kids laughing and being silly<br/>\nfor the first time ever!  And then, the &quot;work&quot; time... They have been made,<br/>\nall summer, to do<br/>\nworkbooks every day.  They go to French school and it is apparently<br/>\ndifficult and she wants to be sure they keep up.  Even during the school yr.<br/>\nthey do workbooks for up to an hour on top of homework in the little bit of<br/>\ntime they have between school and dinner.  The oldest is 8!  I visited them<br/>\nand saw this going on with a lot of misery on the part of the kids and said<br/>\nsomething but was brushed aside.  I guess my problem is that my son gets<br/>\nthese week to two-week shots of this controlling stuff and then comes away<br/>\nthinking he too should be reading or whatever.  It is subtle.  He went away<br/>\nwith the other SIL and her 6 yr. old for a week a few weeks ago and came<br/>\nback wanting to learn how to read (reading Bob books at bed every night to<br/>\nus like his cousin reads big books  His cousin is never read to).  I am glad<br/>\nhe wants to read if he is ready and wanting to not just because his cousin<br/>\nis so far ahead.  Sorry to vent on. I just need to figure out if he is<br/>\nfeeling pressure to do<br/>\nanything and I have not felt that out clearly yet.   I wrote a few weeks ago<br/>\nthat I don&#39;t want to shelter my kids and I&#39;m realizing it was big old lie!<br/>\nI soo want to shelter them.

I visited them and saw this going on with a lot of misery on the part of the kids and said something but was brushed aside.  I guess my problem is that my son gets these week to two-week shots of this controlling stuff and then comes away thinking he too should be reading or whatever.  It is subtle.  He went away with the other SIL and her 6 yr. old for a week a few weeks ago and came back wanting to learn how to read (reading Bob books at bed every night to us like his cousin reads big books  His cousin is never read to).  I am glad he wants to read if he is ready and wanting to not just because his cousin is so far ahead.  Sorry to vent on. I just need to figure out if he is feeling pressure to do<br/>\n anything and I have not felt that out clearly yet.   I wrote a few weeks ago that I don&#39;t want to shelter my kids and I&#39;m realizing it was big old lie!  I soo want to shelter them.  I wish they were going to the conf. with me.  They wanted to stay here to be with their cousins.<br/>\n <br/>\nMadeline<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo! Search - Faster. Easier.
