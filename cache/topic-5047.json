Every night.  It was excruciating.  We tried everything,<br/>\nhomeopathic remedies (two doctors), herbs, essential oils in her bath or<br/>\nboiling on the stove, bedtime routines, stories, acupressure, diet, you<br/>\nname it and nothing worked.  (I was ready to take her to a regular medical<br/>\nsleep doctor type...I was SO desperate) It went on for 18 months like<br/>\nthis. At times I just coped, I made cookies, cleaned the house, started a<br/>\njournal (you can actually do many things at any hour of the night, except<br/>\ncall friends!) We finally figured out that she had a 25 hour body clock<br/>\nand we let her cycle around the clock (it was difficult, napping from 2 am<br/>\nto 5 am, waking up for 8 hours sleeping from 1 pm to 9pm and up &quot;for the<br/>\nday&quot; at 9pm) napping and sleeping whenever she wanted. She was in a better<br/>\nmood and mom was more relaxed, although it hard to explain to neighbors<br/>\nwhy you&#39;re sleeping from 11 am till 6 pm.  And it kind of worked.  It took<br/>\ntwo weeks to get to a &quot;reasonable&quot; bedtime of 10pm and she would still<br/>\ncycle going to bed later and later each night and then sort of<br/>\n&quot;self-correct&quot; by not napping one day.  She finally gave up napping when<br/>\nshe 3 years and a few months and that ended it.  Now she wakes up between<br/>\n8:30 am and 9:30 am, and if she naps (which is only once or twice a week<br/>\nnow) she&#39;s up until 1 am (she doesn&#39;t need a lot of sleep).  So,  if you<br/>\nfollowed all that, has anyone ever had this experience?  Many little ones,<br/>\nit seems, have periods when they don&#39;t go to bed until the wee hours.<br/>\nBut, has anyone been through the wee hours thing for months and<br/>\n(torturous) months on end?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Wini<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________<br/>\nWINIFRED HAUN & DANCERS<br/>\n4225 N.
