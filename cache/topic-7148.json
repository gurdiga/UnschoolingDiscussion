I am at my wit&#39;s end trying to figure<br/>\nout the cause.  The doctor gave my daughter a general exam and ordered<br/>\nroutine tests and an ultrasound but nothing came up.  For a while I<br/>\nwondered if she could suddenly be gluten or dairy sensitive and we tried<br/>\nthe appropriate diets with no success.  Still lots of cramps with no<br/>\nreal rhyme or reason, at all times of the day or night.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone shed any light on this situation?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks very much,<br/>\nSonia<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Further to all the discussion re: baby diets and nursing and<br/>\nintroduction to solids etc. our situation with our children has always<br/>\ninvolved late introduction to solids and child-led weaning at an<br/>\nadvanced age.  (So I am hoping this is not allergy-related!!!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7136,"nextTopicId":7152}}
