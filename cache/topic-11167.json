My 22 month old has<br/>\ncroup again.  My other two children never had it and in my family I grew<br/>\nup in none of us ever had it, so I&#39;m not overly sure how to treat it.  I<br/>\nknow about the steam and taking the child out into the cold air trick<br/>\nbut this is summer so what do I do?  Also, when he&#39;s had it before (this<br/>\nmight be his 4th episode), it&#39;s always happened at night and by day he&#39;s<br/>\nfine.  This time it started at 8 this morning and is continuing through<br/>\nthe day...is it going to get worse tonight yet?  He seems basically<br/>\nfine, is not breathing with great difficulty, just wheezing alot.  We<br/>\nall do have bad colds right now so it&#39;s extra tough for him breathing<br/>\nwhen he&#39;s so congested.  Any advice, information or tips please?  I&#39;d<br/>\nappreciate anything anyone has to offer.  A friend in the past told me<br/>\nto try homeopathy and I did try a couple of doses this a.m. and it did<br/>\nnot seem to help at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11175,"nextTopicId":11190}}
