(i.e. X-rays, bite tests and the whole<br/>\nworks)  This might sound bizarre but I once knew a person who was<br/>\ncompulsive about chewing gum, gnawing on anything she could get her<br/>\nhands on (pencils of course, but also her earpiece on her glasses etc.),<br/>\nand snacking constantly.  She was positively driven to chew or bite.  It<br/>\nturned out her jaw alignment was way out and the tension in her jaw,<br/>\nthough she was completely unaware of it, drove her to chewing<br/>\ninappropriately.  If you think of the jaw as being potentially<br/>\nmis-aligned or &quot;too-tightly wired&quot;, it would be understandable that<br/>\nthere would be &quot;energy&quot; that needs to be released.  Maybe it&#39;s a physics<br/>\nor engineering thing...Anyway, ask a dentist about &quot;T.M.J.&quot; syndrome. <br/>\nOr, if you&#39;re up to it, and as was recently discussed on this list,<br/>\ncould a chiropractor help?  Just an idea.  Good luck dealing with it. <br/>\nIf the dental visit doesn&#39;t work, I don&#39;t suppose drawing undue<br/>\nattention to your son&#39;s condition will help.  Could he yet grow out of<br/>\nit?  I doubt it&#39;s a serious problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  Are you aware of him grinding his teeth (at night) which could also<br/>\nsignal a TMJ problem?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JodyeB1@...\">JodyeB1@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   My soon to be ten year old son bites his finger nails constantly.
