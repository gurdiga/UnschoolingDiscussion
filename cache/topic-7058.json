I am only trying to find a way that woks<br/>\nbest for our family... sincerely, <br/>\nJoshua<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree that there is not just one way of doing things.  After<br/>\nmy son was diagnosed ADHD, I read several books(The Explosive Child, How<br/>\nto Talk so Kids Will Listen, To Train Up A Child,How To Raise a Happy<br/>\nUnspoiled Child, etc.), I attended parenting classes, listened to the<br/>\nadvice of therapists, etc. What I have ended up doing is trying some of<br/>\nthe suggestions, eliminating those that don&#39;t work for us , and moving<br/>\non to something else.  For instance, the sticker chart or poker chip<br/>\nreward system DOES NOT work for us. It may work for some, but Matthew<br/>\njust doesn&#39;t care about rewards.  Positive reinforcement works wonders<br/>\ntho.  Guess you just have to treat child rearing like a 12 step program,<br/>\ntake what you like and leave the rest. Just my 2 cents.  <br/>\nSus</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7054,"nextTopicId":7024}}
