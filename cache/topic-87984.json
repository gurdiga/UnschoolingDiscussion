There are so many photos of babies, parents, toys, <br/>\nstrollers, etc.  When I taught preschool, my kids loved them there as well.  But <br/>\nthe ARTICLES in the big commercial ones are pretty much the same things every <br/>\nmonth.  I like my Welcome Home publication much better.<br/>\nAs for books by the &quot;experts&quot;, some parts of some books I&#39;ve found <br/>\nhelpful...that&#39;s why of course we love the library!   And I have been reading every <br/>\nhs/unschooling book I can get my hands on lately.  Our library just got a Home Ed <br/>\nMag subscription, yippie!  This is one I might have to get myself.<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87977,"nextTopicId":22486}}
