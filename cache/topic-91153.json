I&#39;m entirely serious.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I had been one of those teachers and because I know that parents who <br/>\nare abusing children will not see it clearly at all, we made a deal with two <br/>\nadult friends, when our boys were little.  We told the boys if they ever were <br/>\nreally angry at us or afraid of us, or if they thought we weren&#39;t being good <br/>\nparents, they should go to Paul or Jeff and tell them the whole story.  We told <br/>\nPaul and Jeff, who were in their 20s at the time, and are still in our lives <br/>\nnow, that if the boys came to them to complain they should take the boys&#39; side <br/>\nand listen to them and act if necessary, whether by talking to us or in <br/>\nworst-case scenarios getting the kids out and away from us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt made me feel better.  It was a back-up plan that satisfied, for me, the <br/>\nproblem of the knowledge that some people DO abuse their kids and hide them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI figured, too, it would be a comfort for other teacher-friends who expressed <br/>\nthat concern.   Nobody&#39;s ever asked.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, though, it&#39;s not fair to scoff at those concerns.<br/>\nProbably a lot of the church-based homeschoolers think their churches would <br/>\nbe the backup system, but in a couple of recent horror-shows, the families went <br/>\nto church.  It didn&#39;t save them.  But we don&#39;t know how many families who do <br/>\ngo to church stay in line just to avoid the eyeball of the older women.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome families have no school backup, no church, don&#39;t take their kids to <br/>\ndoctors...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 2/18/04 6:55:26 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wallingford@...\">wallingford@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Bottom line, there were no physical scars on the children.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what you meant by this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are homeschoolers who use physical punishment related to &quot;schoolwork.&quot;<br/>\nThere are homeschoolers who have killed their children.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&quot;School shootings are relatively rare&quot;.

The middle boy�s former<br/>\nteacher was supposedly still infuriated and concerned about him from a<br/>\nnumber of years ago. That felt implausible to me. How many kids does she<br/>\nhave in her class to have to focus on? On the other hand, it came out<br/>\ntowards the end as yet another case where the family slipped through the<br/>\ncracks of the child and family welfare organization of the relevant State.<br/>\nIt irritated me that every time the NY support organization it was with a<br/>\ntone of deep suspicion and hostility. More fodder for the HONDA campaign I<br/>\nguess. I feel strongly that our best protection from suspicion of abuse is<br/>\nbeing visible in the community. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I saw it too, and I was a little angry about it because they brought it up<br/>\nso many times.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, they DID have another homeschool family on there that<br/>\ntalked about other reasons people choose to homeschool, including their own:<br/>\nthey couldn&#39;t afford private school and they didn&#39;t like the public<br/>\nschools.&gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is briefly mentioned in the second half of an hour long show, has far<br/>\nless impact than the much repeated information expressed by the leads in the<br/>\nfirst 15 minutes. People switch channels at predictable times � every 15<br/>\nminutes in the commercial break, and specifically at the half hour when some<br/>\nother program may actually be starting. The Law and Order format is<br/>\nparticularly conducive to viewers going and then returning just to see how<br/>\nthe end turned out. I�ve done that before now.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

For the most<br/>\npart, the detectives were ignorant about homeschooling but listened to<br/>\nothers about the process of homeschooling.  I didn&#39;t get the impression they<br/>\nwere out to slam homeschoolers.  They also had advocates of homeschooling<br/>\ndefending the process which I thought was good.  I also thought there was a<br/>\nreally good lesson about being aware of what is around you.  Take the mother<br/>\nfor instance that realized when her daughter and the paranoids mother&#39;s son<br/>\nwere getting too close she pulled away along with the fact the mother didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow her daughter had received the e-mails from that boy.  What if the<br/>\nmother was more in tune with her daughter would she have known about the<br/>\ne-mail and been able to prevent the little boys death?  Something to think<br/>\nabout it.  I thought it was a balanced show.  The truth is I am sure there<br/>\nare parents who probably do homeschool for some paranoid reasons.  But isn&#39;t<br/>\nthat true about life.  There are some scary people in this world!  My phrase<br/>\nI use often is ...&quot;People, people,....they are everywhere!&quot;  It takes all<br/>\nkinds to make the world go round.  I too however think often about proving<br/>\nto the law that what I am doing is best for my girls by unschooling.  I am<br/>\nvery new to homeschooling as well as unschooling.  I just bathe it in prayer<br/>\nand do the very best I can do.<br/>\n<br/>\nTracey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTracey Inman<br/>\nLegacy for Life<br/>\n336.580.1844<br/>\nhttp://TraceyInman.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.590 / Virus Database: 373 - Release Date: 2/16/2004</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Law and Order","postDate":"1077135656","msgId":91157,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdhLjUxMjdjZjZkLjJkNjUyMzI4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":91154,"nextInTopic":91160,"prevInTime":91156,"nextInTime":91158,"topicId":91153,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/18/04 11:35:58 AM, litlrooh@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1105142373\">In a message dated 2/18/04 11:35:58 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:litlrooh@...\">litlrooh@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  It is true that some people homeschool to control their kids.
