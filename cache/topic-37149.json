It&#39;s everywhere <br/>\nand most folks just tune it out or chalk it up as something mysterious. <br/>\nMath is so totally cool all by itself, if someone needs to dress it up, <br/>\nthen they don&#39;t get it, imho.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8yo started out using a math text. When she was six she got a <br/>\ndifferent answer than the workbook. She explained to me why her answer <br/>\nmade sense. She was right - the question was so poorly explained, that <br/>\nher answer was more logical. (the diagram didn&#39;t match the question, and <br/>\nshe answered by the diagram.)  We stopped using that book. She still <br/>\nlikes math books, but we use them as a jumping off point, or to check <br/>\nthings. The more we use math, the better she likes it and the more <br/>\ninteresting it gets. Math is fun, and it isn&#39;t mysterious, and it&#39;s <br/>\neverywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo many of us parents were both bored to tears and terrorized by math <br/>\nin school, that we think we can&#39;t do it. We can, btw, we use it all the <br/>\ntime -- when we cook, go shopping, paint a room, pay our bills, watch <br/>\nsports, do crafts, in music, and all sorts of places.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t calm down -- keep yelling. :-)  People need to get it -- anyone <br/>\ncan do math.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan Marie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Monday, May 20, 2002, at 01:53 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dacunefare@...\">dacunefare@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; So far I&#39;ve titled this post &quot;Bad math aid&quot; and &quot;Math phobia production<br/>\n&gt; tools&quot; and even &quot;ACK!
