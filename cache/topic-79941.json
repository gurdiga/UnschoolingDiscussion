My twin sons (age 11) have mild TS.  It&#39;s not anything I&#39;m terribly concerned about (I went to one pediatric neurologist who did all kinds of tests, including sleep deprived eeg, video taped sleep deprived eeg&#39;s, etc...) and suggested medication.  We refused, then went to another pediatric neurologist about a year later when the nature of the tics changed (from shoulder shrugging and sniffing, to hitting themselves (not violently) in the stomach.  He (bless his heart) told me to go home and never come back (with a grin).  He said he wouldn&#39;t DREAM of putting them on meds with the mild degrees of tics they were displaying and told me not to worry about it.  I appreciated his relaxed nature and his not pushing the meds issue, but the tics do sometimes get a little embarassing for the boys.  So the idea of eliminating dairy for a month or so, and then seeing what happens, is very appealing (and simple and drug free!)  So thanks!  I look forward to hearing from others who are dealing with this, especially those who have kids whose TS is not that severe. So a TS unschooling list would be great.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my heart goes out to those who are dealing with this in a much more consuming way.  My youngest son is a severe stutterer, and that gets much more of my attention, and can be very heartwrenching for all of us.   An yet, compared to other challenges so many kids and parents deal with, well, I&#39;m still grateful that this is his only struggle!  <br/>\n<br/>\nLook forward to hearing from others....<br/>\nDori<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Holly Furgason <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, September 07, 2003 8:43 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: TS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Shannon&quot; <br/>\n  &lt;davenshan@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; Do you think any of the TS stuff could be related to food <br/>\n  allergies?  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Abba&#39;s TS definitely has an autoimmune componenet and isn&#39;t that what <br/>\n  allergies are?<br/>\n<br/>\n  The<br/>\n  &gt; reason I ask is because my son, Connor has severe food allergies.  <br/>\n  Before we<br/>\n  &gt; found this out, he had tics all the time, he was angry, nobody <br/>\n  could touch<br/>\n  &gt; him without him coming unglued.

If she&#39;d have <br/>\ncontinued like that we probably would have had to hospitalize her.  <br/>\nShe was totally out of control; banging her head, biting herself, <br/>\nhitting and biting other people.  You couldn&#39;t hold her because her <br/>\narms and legs would fail around wildly and it was like she was having <br/>\na 24 hour tantrum, screaming and yelling at everyone.  I was so <br/>\nafraid she&#39;d be like that forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that her tics were so bad that we had to give her codiene for <br/>\nthe pain.

They have not happened often and when they have it has been in high stress, noisy, overwhelming situations. DD loves hard squeezes, trampoline bouncing repetively  and has learned to move when stress becomes to high. An interesting thing is that I read the Highly Sensitive Child and learned about the need for firm pressure, etc..At this point we have let go of needing a label and are happy to just learn other ways to help her in her journey of learning about herself and honouring that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaureen<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Crystal <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, September 05, 2003 9:15 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] TS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;Beth said:  We have found that giving Douglass the skills to master his<br/>\n  own physical needs helped so much&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is the key to it all, isn&#39;t it?
