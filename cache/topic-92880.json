If it gets <br/>\ncrowded, they have the choice of being in a more cluttered room, or <br/>\nstoring some things under the house or getting rid of it. I help <br/>\nthem find ways to organize things also.<br/>\nBut I wouldn&#39;t get rid of something just because *I* thought it <br/>\nwas &quot;junk&quot;.<br/>\nYou really need to let go of some of your personal agenda in these <br/>\nissues and try to focus on what makes your child happy.
