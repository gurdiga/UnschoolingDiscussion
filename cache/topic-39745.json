I am a cat person and basically dislike dogs.  After doing some research","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-94340983\">Sandra - your cheap toy was Rosie the Reading Dog here - dd was<br/>\ndesperate for a dog.  I am a cat person and basically dislike<br/>\ndogs.  After doing some research and talking to folks who had<br/>\nworking dogs, I was pretty sure that dd would have to be about 5<br/>\nbefore she could be the emotional owner of a large dog (we&#39;re in<br/>\nthe country and a dog small enough for a hawk or coyote to get<br/>\nreadily would have been a mega tragedy).  I had no illusions that<br/>\nat 5 she would be able to do the physical feeding/ washing and<br/>\nall, but she needed to able to give commands that were lovingly<br/>\nobeyed.  Biding her time till she was 5, she regularly told dog<br/>\nstories and made up adventures with different kinds of dogs.  One<br/>\nday the star was Rosie - the dog who could read.  DD wanted to<br/>\nread - and had been reading in the sense of matching brands to<br/>\nwords and identifying some words since she was 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had a good grasp of sounds and a pretty fair sense of which<br/>\nsounds went with which symbols.  As I said, we are in the middle<br/>\nof nowhere, which involves some long car trips.  I heartily<br/>\nrecommend the no equipment, low effort car game of &quot;I see<br/>\nsomething that starts with &#39;buh&#39;&quot; to which the other player may<br/>\nreply &quot;It&#39;s a barn; I see something that starts with &#39;kuh&#39;&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s a barn; yarn rhymes with barn; what rhymes with &#39;cow&#39;&quot; or<br/>\nany other variant the delays the dreaded &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyway back to Rosie the Reading dog - after she had told me<br/>\na couple of stories about Rosie&#39;s adventures (the poor dog got<br/>\nlocked into the library all night once, which I attribute to Marc<br/>\nBrown, but that&#39;s OK) - I decided Rosie might be a message, so we<br/>\nsat down to decide what Rosie looked like.  She was a red dog<br/>\n(Clifford - where are you???) with long ears and so forth.  After<br/>\nmultiple drafts and some talking about how creatures with big<br/>\neyes are usually the young of a species or are supposed to be<br/>\nparticularly appealing (we did not overtly discuss anime, but she<br/>\nasked me about Kiki&#39;s eyes the nest time she watched it) we had a<br/>\npretty cute 8 1/2 x 11 size dog.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, dogs like bones and Rosie likes to read....put your selected<br/>\nword endings on a bone shaped cut out, cut the slits that Sandra<br/>\nrecommended and make your strips of phoneme beginnings.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\ntumble to the strips and slits until I had made a half a dozen or<br/>\nso favorite/new word bones for dd, but I got tired of cutting out<br/>\nbones and was trying to make things easier on myself. It worked<br/>\nso well that I actually looked up the 42 (?) (don&#39;t remember any<br/>\nmore) consonant based phonemes and consciously mixed them up<br/>\nbetween singles and digraphs on each strip.  DD has a folder with<br/>\nRosie and her bones and strips; it is in with the paper dolls and<br/>\ncoloring books.  She periodically gets it out to play with or as<br/>\na tool for making poems for birthday cards and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it had not been a fun game all the way along, I suspect I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have pursued it at all.  She will be 6 next week; loves<br/>\nher dog; and while nothing in the dentist&#39;s office magazine<br/>\nselection interests her, she independently reads much more that I<br/>\nsuspect, and with the occasional &quot;Mom what does *-*-*-* spell?&quot;<br/>\nis happily working her way through Redwall again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, August 04, 2002 1:03 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] a cheap reading toy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| One easily made disposable reading toy for kids who say &quot;I want<br/>\nto learn to<br/>\n| read&quot; involves a piece of cardboard (like the back of a legal<br/>\npad, or even<br/>\n| part of a cereal box, but single-layer tagboard, not corrugated<br/>\ncardboard),<br/>\n| something to cut two slots in (Xacto knife, razor blade) and a<br/>\nlong strip of<br/>\n| regular paper (we used to tape more than one strip together.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Fix the paper so it will slide through the two slots.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| On the cardboard write part of a word which can be changed with<br/>\ndifferent<br/>\n| endings or beginnings.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Like on the cardboard to the right of the two slots, write  &quot;A<br/>\nT&quot;<br/>\n| and where the stip of paper goes through will be the first<br/>\nletters of various<br/>\n| words ending in &quot;_at.&quot;<br/>\n|<br/>\n| b<br/>\n| c<br/>\n| f<br/>\n| h<br/>\n| m<br/>\n| p<br/>\n| r<br/>\n| s<br/>\n|       (kids probably won&#39;t know &quot;tat&quot; but if you&#39;re a tatter,<br/>\nthrow &quot;t&quot; in!!)<br/>\n| v<br/>\n|<br/>\n| and<br/>\n| maybe some blends after that, like<br/>\n| fl (at)<br/>\n| or<br/>\n| spl (at)<br/>\n|<br/>\n| If that&#39;s fun, make others.
