I still <br/>\nhave my report card, so I could tell you the date of every lesson. &lt;g&gt;   It <br/>\nwas a year or so (I don&#39;t want to go find it).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was ten I joined band at school so I could get out of class.  I played <br/>\nclarinet because I had NO idea what my choices were when they asked us to say <br/>\nwhat instrument we wanted, so I copied &quot;clarinet&quot; off my friend&#39;s paper.  <br/>\nTurns out that whole back row copied.  They had never shown us instruments or <br/>\ntold us what all our options were, and I ran with a whole large crowd of <br/>\nfirstborns with no older siblings to copy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two instruments I play now are guitar and recorder.  I play recorder <br/>\nbetter than I play guitar, but I learned recorder on my own, then took a year of <br/>\nlessons at the university to learn Baroque technique (to do sonata-stuff, which <br/>\nisn&#39;t all that fun for me).  But I had already been in a Renaissance group <br/>\nbefore that, and so it didn&#39;t propel me along except along a particular route.   <br/>\n The teacher insisted on a thumbrest.  I used it when he was looking and took <br/>\nit off when he wasn&#39;t.  It was irritating, but he was a clarinet professor <br/>\nand believed thumbrests were essential.  They&#39;re not.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuitar, I had one lesson and learned more by messing with it, watching other <br/>\nguitarists who were doing fingerpicking, and asking questions.  My mom played <br/>\nguitar, but with a flatpick, and I wanted to learn fingerpicking, so I did.  I <br/>\nuse it to accompany singing, and that&#39;s all.  I don&#39;t do guitar for guitar&#39;s <br/>\nsake.  So I&#39;m not &quot;a guitarist.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can read music, but I don&#39;t for guitar.  I don&#39;t even think notation when <br/>\nI&#39;m playing guitar, nor note names.  Chord names, yes, but if I do a run or an <br/>\nornament, I don&#39;t think of what part of the chord that is, I just do it by ear.<br/>\n<br/>\nPiano, I can do by written music or by ear, but there&#39;s a kind of <br/>\ndisconnection in my head, like I use a different part of my body, kind of.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think of any nation&#39;s folk music, people learned it by being around <br/>\nothers who played, and picking things up very gradually.
