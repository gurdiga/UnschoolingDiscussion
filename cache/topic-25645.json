This simple project is<br/>\nripe with understanding of: layout, manipulation of raw material,<br/>\nphysical/spatial interaction, how wood cutting tools function (where does<br/>\nall that saw dust come from anyway?), and if you care to-wood finishes.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Warning &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the rest of this post goes into a me me me post<br/>\nthe kind of which I often hate reading.  It has a point though &lt;g&gt; Skip to<br/>\nthe last paragraph if you can&#39;t bear it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was blessed with a father who had only the most rudimentary understanding<br/>\nof these two subjects.  Wood working started for me with projects no more<br/>\ncomplicated than trimming the bottom of doors to fit over the new carpet.  I<br/>\nwent on to build simple boxes that my mom just loved (and which she still<br/>\ndoes). And passing my parent¹s abilities, to build cabinetry in my teen<br/>\nyears. My auto mechanics abilities started by maintaining the fluid levels<br/>\nin the cars and changing a radiator hose. And I slowly gained greater<br/>\nunderstanding as starters, alternators and water pumps needed replacement<br/>\nwith the knowledge gained from neighbors and the guys at the auto parts<br/>\nstore.  I was lucky enough to have a mentor in the form of a neighbor with 3<br/>\nkids and 5 cars that always needed repairs (the cars, not the kids) ­ my<br/>\nhead was always welcome under any of those hoods.  Don¹t underestimate<br/>\nfinding and developing a relationship with a good auto parts store either.<br/>\n<br/>\n35 years later a significant, enjoyable, part of my professional life<br/>\ninvolves woodworking. And I shake my head when a friend pays $50 to have a<br/>\n$5 thermostat replaced. It¹s hard to describe the pride and satisfaction<br/>\nreturning the engine I have repaired to my car and having it motor our<br/>\nfamily about town, just as its designers intended. Or to visit my folks and<br/>\nsee the cabinets that I built still house the first dishwasher they ever<br/>\nowned.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you¹d mentioned electronics instead of woodworking and auto mechanics,<br/>\nI¹d tell you about how my dad, who didn¹t know much about those new fangled<br/>\ntransistors, started buying me those little kits from Radio Shack when I was<br/>\n10 years old.  And how that lead to my parents spending what was for them a<br/>\n*huge* amount of money to buy a HeathKit Television set for me to assemble<br/>\nwhen I was 15 years old (I was in heaven!)  The trust in my abilities and<br/>\nthe growth in my self esteem represented by that event stays with me to this<br/>\nday.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep mind that it is possible to douse the fire of a budding interest by<br/>\ndumping *too much* stuff, information etc. on it.  As a kid I was so thirsty<br/>\nfor these experiences and knowledge-I asked for and sought out these<br/>\nactivities. You want to open the possibilities and nurture, not smother.<br/>\nThis seems much easier to keep in check when you&#39;re learning and discovering<br/>\nside by side. Today my son and I are learning about microprocessors because<br/>\nof his continued interest in robotics. (again I am in heaven!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of these abilities of mine grew out of some excellent parenting. Even<br/>\nthough I attended public school, my folks never let it interfere with my<br/>\nlearning by supplying the opportunity, resources, love and support, and<br/>\nvalue for the things I wanted to do and know about.  They bristle when I<br/>\ntell them that they were homeschoolers and didn¹t know it.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dan Vilter</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"-IaPcHp7EmxbIM1wloz0I8fn4uDxeafmd0VKrzA5DOQ49R52NHvVSMrP6hlgX-nLivZpPDVcsB3xx8wwiA_tcrmirPwtOgkBkcs","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: An actual question  about.....unschooling!

I would have little seekers of knowledge, children who would be <br/>\nconstantly amazing me and showing their Dad how cool this concept really is! <br/>\nInstead here is how things truly are; My son decided this summer he wanted to <br/>\ngo to school! CAN YOU IMAGINE??? what? he wants to go to school? all this <br/>\ntumbling around in my mind. But since I wanted my theory of choice in <br/>\neducation to work, I knew I couldn&#39;t be a hypocrite, I had to allow him that <br/>\nchoice! Now off he goes with his little backpack to the neighborhood <br/>\nkindergarten, every morning at 8:10 returning at 3:45. Well! I say to myself, <br/>\nthis gives me hours everyday to spend with my daughter, who I just know will <br/>\nlove all the wonderful boxes of *stuff she can dig through, she will spend <br/>\nhours with her nose in a book, we will have discussions galore, trips around <br/>\ntown.... Ahhh blessed reality! My wonderfully talented daughter, she started <br/>\ntalking at 9 months, she walked at 10 months, she read at 3, tied her shoes <br/>\nat 3 1/2.... She wants to know when she can go outside to swing, how much <br/>\nlonger she has to read this book, and &quot;MOOMMMMmm, what am *I supposed to do <br/>\nwith all this junk?&quot; Goodness! I say, read as much of that book as you <br/>\nlike... do what ever you want with all that... AND ITS NOT JUNK! and you can <br/>\nplay outside all you want! She just stares at me, and asks &quot;when are you <br/>\ngoing to teach me something?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, our local homeschool group is SO <br/>\nschool-at-home oriented and when I go around them, I find myself tending to <br/>\nbe really anxious and look for<br/>\na curriculum.  What am I missing?  Is unschooling so simple that I am <br/>\nstumbling over it? Help!<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel exactly the same about my husband as you do about your homeschooling <br/>\ngroup! I too feel I must be missing something, how could anything so simple <br/>\nbe so darn complicated? Julie, you struck a chord with me, I know where you <br/>\nare coming from. I think to myself, have I failed, did I not understand the <br/>\nconcept? How come it works for everyone else? <br/>\nThanks for putting up with my ramble!<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Wilkinson6@msn.com","from":"Wilkinson6@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"xqLIiSznEbOfgOAj1JvBrMN8MN46RfW7F-TYxmIGJBK86MnkNzZMw_iJEFfaEJ9CPKz3LqeNXxlJ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: An actual question about.....unschooling!
