Maybe I&#39;m not saying <br/>\nthis completely right ... does the loose or non-existant &quot;control&quot; of <br/>\nthe child&#39;s education STOP when it comes to their responsible <br/>\nparticipation in the everyday running of the family household?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have consequences when they don&#39;t do their share of the <br/>\nchores?  Do they have tv or stereo taken away?  Are these <br/>\nconsequences consistently enforced?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they are, then how does that go back to not enforcing consequences <br/>\nif the child doesn&#39;t do anything &quot;constructive&quot; towards his or her <br/>\neducation during the week.  And I&#39;m sure constructive isn&#39;t exactly <br/>\nthe right word to use either ... that definition and labels issue <br/>\nagain ... but how do you deal with the issue of being permissive in <br/>\ntheir education and not being or being too permissive in their <br/>\nparticipation in the family&#39;s life?<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, I&#39;m done now ... &lt;sigh&gt; ... the questions were just flying at me <br/>\nfrom a friend and I didn&#39;t have a ready answer for her since I <br/>\nunschool with just one of my four children and can live like that.  <br/>\nBut, I know a bunch of unschoolers wouldn&#39;t agree that I was <br/>\nunschooling since I&#39;m not doing it with all my kids.  Oh <br/>\nraspberries ... I&#39;m sure someone out of the 500 or so members on this <br/>\nlist understanding what I mean.
