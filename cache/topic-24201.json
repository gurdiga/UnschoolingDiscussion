I have an 8yo who suddenly is scared to be in his room alone, or <br/>\n even to be upstairs alone. He cries  -- and I mean really frightened crying. <br/>\n He&#39;s afraid to sleep in his room. He won&#39;t consider being dropped off at a <br/>\n friend&#39;s house or Scouts. Just starts crying and clinging. This has been <br/>\n going on about two weeks. No major scary events in our lives lately. My <br/>\n mother suggests it is because we are together too much and he needs to be <br/>\n out more with other people and &quot;children his age.&quot; Has anyone had any <br/>\n experience with this? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   maybe it is an age thing? I would read Your Eight Year Old by Ames and Ilg.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I would not listen to your mother&#39;s advice. Go w/ yur own instincts on <br/>\nthis.
