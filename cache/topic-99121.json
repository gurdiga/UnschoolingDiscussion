You will need an audio <br/>\nsystem in your computer, something almost all new machines have. Run <br/>\na cable from the line-out port of your tape player or receiver to the <br/>\nline-in port of your computer&#39;s sound system.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would use the free Audacity software to convert the sound to <br/>\ndigital and clean up any pops or hisses. You can download Audacity <br/>\nat: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://audacity.sourceforge.net/about.php\">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/about.php</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have your music on your hard drive, you can export it to <br/>\nCDs. The software that comes with your DVD burner will do that, as <br/>\nwill many free programs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the things you want to do are mainstream issues today.
