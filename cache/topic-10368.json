I can<br>&gt; understand<br>&gt; &gt; soapboxes, and \n      how people feel very passionately about certain things.<br>But<br>&gt; \n      &gt; all of the rudeness has gotten to the point that it&#39;s embarrassing \n      to<br>&gt; think<br>&gt; &gt; that anyone would visit this list to \n      subscribe and see so much harshness<br>&gt; and<br>&gt; &gt; downright \n      meanness. It&#39;s one thing to make room for other&#39;s views \n      and<br>also<br>&gt; &gt; to disagree with them. It&#39;s another to be so \n      intolerant and rude.

I am not here to agree or disagree with anyone.<br>&gt; \n    &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I am here to say that even though I have been quite \n    tolerant and patient<br>&gt; of<br>&gt; &gt; these emails filling my inbox \n    these last few days, it&#39;s a bit tiring<br>&gt; seeing<br>&gt; &gt; some \n    really judgmental and quite rude statements. Everybody does things<br>&gt; \n    &gt; differently, and what works for some doesn&#39;t work for all. I \n    can<br>&gt; understand<br>&gt; &gt; soapboxes, and how people feel very \n    passionately about certain things.<br>But<br>&gt; &gt; all of the rudeness \n    has gotten to the point that it&#39;s embarrassing to<br>&gt; think<br>&gt; &gt; \n    that anyone would visit this list to subscribe and see so much \n    harshness<br>&gt; and<br>&gt; &gt; downright meanness. It&#39;s one thing to \n    make room for other&#39;s views and<br>also<br>&gt; &gt; to disagree with them. \n    It&#39;s another to be so intolerant and rude. I&#39;m<br>&gt; weary<br>&gt; &gt; of \n    all of this, and yes Dia, I have given you some attention that \n    you<br>seem<br>&gt; &gt; to be needy of by directing this email toward you, \n    as it&#39;s mainly your<br>&gt; &gt; defensive, aggressive, condescension that I \n    am addressing.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Now, I&#39;m sure this email won&#39;t make \n    a bit of difference to some, but<br>there<br>&gt; &gt; are so many other \n    topics that we can introduce rather then allowing some<br>&gt; of<br>&gt; \n    &gt; this rudeness to continue.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Dia, could you \n    possibly reply to someone&#39;s email without dissecting it<br>and<br>&gt; &gt; \n    flaming them? (and if you want to copy and paste this into an email \n    with<br>&gt; &gt; excerpts from other emails that you have replied to \n    without flaming<br>&gt; someone,<br>&gt; &gt; feel free).<br>&gt; \n    &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Much love to all,<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Brynn<br>&gt; \n    &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; -----Original \n    Message-----<br>&gt; &gt; From: Dia Garland [<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moocow@...\">mailto:moocow@...</a>]<br>&gt; &gt; \n    Sent: Wednesday, June 28, 2000 8:19 PM<br>&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br>&gt; \n    &gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] abuse<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; \n    &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;.&nbsp; Anytime you physically touch someone \n    without their<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permission, it could be \n    constituted as abuse&lt;&lt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;.&nbsp; \n    Accidental contact is one thing and that<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; is not what I was \n    talking about.&lt;&lt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; These are two different \n    statements.&nbsp; The first is what I was replying<br>to.<br>&gt; &gt; You \n    said &quot;anytime&quot;.&nbsp; On another list I probably would have realized \n    that<br>&gt; the<br>&gt; &gt; writer was exaggerating somewhat, here I just \n    don&#39;t know.&nbsp; It&#39;s like<br>&gt; jumping<br>&gt; &gt; into a group of \n    pirahnas.&nbsp; I am very glad that you don&#39;t scream &quot;abuse&quot;<br>if<br>&gt; \n    &gt; someone bumps you in line.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n    Spanking is intentionally hurting someone<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; in a way that is \n    not acceptable. &lt;&lt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; It may not be acceptable \n    in your opinion, that does not mean that it is<br>&gt; not<br>&gt; &gt; \n    acceptable to everyone.&nbsp; Your opinion is not the only one in \n    existence.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; You are humiliating your child any \n    time you lay a hand on them.&nbsp; Trust<br>&gt; me,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve \n    been one of those children.&lt;&lt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I am not \n    humiliating my child, I am correcting my child.&nbsp; I was \n    beaten<br>as<br>&gt; a<br>&gt; &gt; child, and I know full well the \n    difference between beating and spanking.<br>&gt; &gt; No, I don&#39;t trust \n    you.&nbsp; Not even a little bit.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; \n    &gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&gt; \n    0% Introductory APR!<br>&gt; Instant Approval!<br>&gt; Aria Visa - get yours \n    today.<br>&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6035/14/_/448294/_/962292792/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6035/14/_/448294/_/962292792/</a><br>&gt; \n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n    Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br>&gt; Check \n    it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n    To Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br></font></div></blockquote><tt>Message boards, timely articles, a \n  free newsletter and more!<br>Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br><br>Addresses:<br>Post \n  message: Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com<br>Unsubscribe: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br>List owner: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com<br>List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br></tt><br></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10370,"nextTopicId":10023}}
