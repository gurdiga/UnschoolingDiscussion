Once you find something, you can then read it in about 6 translations (including Greek and vulgate Latin, if you&#39;re talented!).  It&#39;s where I do my research, since I also like to see which concepts remain intact regardless of translation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to Sandra, actually Israel was a recognized country with a monarchy, etc, until about 70 C.E.  It didn&#39;t exist again as a separate political entity until recreated in 1948.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to Kim - Genesis 1:1-27, it says God created the heaven, then the earth, then light, then earth separate from water, then plants, then day & night, then animals, then man & woman at the same time.  In Genesis 2:4-25, God created the earth, then the heavens and BEFORE the plants were created, he created man, then planted a garden, then formed the animals to keep man company, then when they didn&#39;t work, God made woman.  And BTW, adam is a hebrew word which means &quot;man&quot; and &quot;adamah&quot; is a hebrew word for earth, so many scholars see the Adam creation story as a sort of play on words.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nHotJobs, a Yahoo! service - Search Thousands of New Jobs<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40291,"nextTopicId":40284}}
