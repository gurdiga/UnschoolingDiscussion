I am new to this loop and was so struck by the similarities, that I <br/>\ndecided to go on and introduce myself.  I am also in the middle of a move, <br/>\nwell at the tail end actually.  However, it hasn&#39;t been very long since my <br/>\nhouse was bare of furniture and with a very confused cat and dog!  We also <br/>\nmoved to the country, although we didn&#39;t build a house.<br/>\nHowever, in between our move from one home to the other, we rented a very <br/>\nsmall 2 bedroom cabin with no phone or computer.  That was really fun!  It <br/>\nwas like being on vacation, as there were no other people renting at the <br/>\ntime, and we were right on a lake.  It was like expenencing the country <br/>\nbefore we got our home and we loved it!<br/>\n     Anyway, my name if Tami and I am from Indiana.  I am married to David <br/>\nand we are unschooling our four kids: 17 yob, 13 yob, 10 yob, and a 7 yog.  <br/>\nWe have homeschooled for 3 1/2 years.  We tend to unschool with periods of <br/>\nguilt ridden  &quot;let&#39;s hit the books&quot;, until we go crazy with boredom and go <br/>\nback to unschooling.<br/>\n     I tend to be very unsctructured so unschooling is right up my alley.  <br/>\nHowever, my parents both just retired from the public school system and they <br/>\nare very into the public school way of doing school----that is where my guilt <br/>\ncomes from.<br/>\n     I am looking forward to reading what other unschoolers go through.
