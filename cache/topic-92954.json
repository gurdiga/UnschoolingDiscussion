The basics have nothing to do with the codes school children are taught to write down (most often without understanding). So what about writing? This was the subject I was comfortable with but it was only a few nights ago that I realized worrying about spelling and grammar and structure would get me nowhere. It&#39;s the same thing as math, that stuff is just the language, the code for what writing REALLY is. Writing is really about storytelling. It&#39;s really about telling jokes and family stories and making up tales on the fly. It&#39;s about becoming adept at relating compelling events and drawing others into what you are relating or imagining. The actual physical act of writing stuff down happened thousands upon thousands of years after humans had already become master storytellers and developed complicated myths, beliefs and legends. Why should we be assuming that all of a sudden the physical act is the more important matter? <br/>\n    Anyhow, tell stories (real and fantastic), tell jokes, share gossip (the nice stuff), listen to all of his stories and jokes, make language about living not about a struggle with a pencil and your child won&#39;t be able to help but want to master the skill that will let him share his own ideas and stories with others. Maybe it will come later than most kids when he does begin to write, but he&#39;ll likely have a whole lot more to write about. <br/>\n      School has spent so many years trying to hitch the cart up in front of the horse. We unschoolers are finally learning the way it should be done.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77070457,"authorName":"Sanguinegirl83@aol.com","from":"Sanguinegirl83@...","profile":"sanguinegirl83","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Younger unschoolers","postDate":"1082587330","msgId":92998,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRjLjJiMDFjNmFiLjJkYjg1MmMyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":92995,"nextInTopic":93004,"prevInTime":92997,"nextInTime":92999,"topicId":92954,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/21/2004 1:42:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

His hand can&#39;t keep up with his head, and even typing <br/>\non the computer is too slow since he&#39;s still hunting and pecking. So <br/>\nwhen he wants to write a story, most of the time he dictates it to me <br/>\nand I either type or hand-write it for him. Someone told me that he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t really &quot;writing&quot;, but I think that&#39;s totally bogus. If I was <br/>\nincapacitated in an accident and became a quadraplegic, and I <br/>\ndictated a novel and had someone else type it up, who would be the <br/>\nauthor, me or the typist?? Writing (at least in the creative sense) <br/>\nis the process of invention, not the act of making lines and circles <br/>\non paper. That will come along as motor skills progress to the point <br/>\nwhere they can catch up with the brain. Ditto with reading - what&#39;s <br/>\nmore important - that kids have a love of great stories and can <br/>\nimagine them in their heads, or that they learn to make sense of the <br/>\nlines and sticks on the page by a certain age? There&#39;s plenty of <br/>\npeople out there in the world who *can* read, but don&#39;t want to. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my .02 would be that if he wants to write a story, help him <br/>\nwith the mechanics of it until his handwriting improves. Usually my <br/>\nson will write the title page, or even start a story and I&#39;ll help <br/>\nhim finish it when he gets bogged down. As time has passed, he can <br/>\nwrite more and more. It&#39;s still not easy for him, as it is for other <br/>\nkids even younger than him, but he&#39;ll get it in his own time. To me, <br/>\nit&#39;s more important that they love and are not frustrated by the <br/>\ncreative process.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know in my heart he has the rest of his life to learn to read and <br/>\n&gt;write but only such a short time to be a little boy but I can&#39;t help <br/>\n&gt;but feel inferior to the more traditional homeschooling moms. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are things you can do to reassure yourself - keep a journal, <br/>\nkeep a file of the stuff your kids write/draw/do, etc. Sometimes if <br/>\nyou&#39;re struggling with doubts, it helps just to sit down and look at <br/>\nhow they&#39;re learning, all on their own to do something like write <br/>\nmore clearly. Or to look at a journal of all the thing you do in a <br/>\nday, week, or month. This can be helpful to do, even for a little <br/>\nwhile, until you feel more comfortable just going day by day with the <br/>\nknowledge that they&#39;re growing and learning all the time. I think <br/>\nit&#39;s helpful to think of all the regular stuff that they learn how to <br/>\ndo with no instruction. Like look at your children&#39;s pictures. At age <br/>\n2 or 3, people are big round circles with lines coming out the side <br/>\nfor arms and legs. By 4 or 5 or so, the people develop heads and hair <br/>\nand belly buttons, fingers and toes. No one sits down with a child <br/>\nand tells them that they need to stop drawing round people and start <br/>\nmaking bodies, heads, hair, etc. They just do so, from observing the <br/>\nworld around them and constantly updating what they can do. This <br/>\norganic process occurs with reading and writing too. As they learn <br/>\nmore words, they spell more of them correctly. As they begin to <br/>\nnotice grammar, they use it more efficiently in their writing. I <br/>\nremember when my son discovered quote marks in books we read. All of <br/>\na sudden, his writing was filled with quotes. <br/>\n&quot;Boom!&quot;, &quot;Bang!&quot;, &quot;Wow&quot; he said. was one line I remember. Ditto when <br/>\nhe discovered exclamation marks. They figure these things out, one at <br/>\na time, the same way they add in belly buttons and hair to drawings. <br/>\nIf you start to just pay attention to it, you&#39;ll see the growth <br/>\nhappen before your eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Younger unschoolers","postDate":"1082565764","msgId":92971,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ5Ljg5ODNkMDQuMmRiN2ZlODRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":92970,"nextInTopic":92973,"prevInTime":92970,"nextInTime":92972,"topicId":92954,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/21/04 8:41:03 AM, dezigna@comcast.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-468130599\">In a message dated 4/21/04 8:41:03 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dezigna@...\">dezigna@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Some author was writing at length about the amazingly deep philosophical<br/>\nissues that youngsters will bring up - was it Holt? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s <br/>\n<br/>\n Philosophy and the Young Child<br/>\nGareth B.

In your situation you are<br/>\ndeschooling yourself, as I still am, from the large number of years you<br/>\nspent in the school system, which means renouncing your schoolish inner<br/>\nlanguage and thoughts. If you really want to get the full wonder of<br/>\nunschooling, it is not enough just to bite your tongue around your son,<br/>\nalthough that is a good start! I deliberately never look at any of those<br/>\nschedules of learning, or seek out graded materials. Jayn has some workbooks<br/>\nthat grandparents have given her, that are in with her coloring books. I<br/>\nalso ignore the recommended age on some books and computer games, getting<br/>\nwhat Jayn expresses interest in. When I get doubts, I hurry over to the<br/>\nunschooling.com message boards or list archives for an injection of faith.<br/>\nThat is, unless Jayn removes those niggling concerns first by some wonderful<br/>\naction that shows her personality and development!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;How Children Learn&quot; by John Holt is specifically about the younger set - be<br/>\ncertain to get the latest edition of his books, which he annotated before he<br/>\ndied.

I can offer only the comfort that you are not alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes (ok honestly quite often) feel this is so easy I must be doing it wrong.  No struggles over what to do and what not to do...with deep rooted memories of my own school experience, if you don&#39;t hate it and resent practicing it over and over it can&#39;t be important.  I know this is not true but sometimes the insecurities creep back up.  I wonder ( to myself) as you do, &quot;How do they measure up with their peers?&quot;  We are the only unschoolers in our homeschool group and it is sometimes hard to keep things in perspective.  I hear stories of all these child prodigies and my 8 year old still struggles to read.  I know in my heart I am doing what is best for my kids.  So how do we gain the confidence?  I don&#39;t know.  I guess through years of seeing our children grow and learn we will just relax.  I hope!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to know how other unschoolers have dealt with the insecurities.  My son Tyler loves to read and we read together all the time but he struggles.   Also writing, I see kids he age writing volumes and we can&#39;t string a sentence together.  Am I killing his future?  Will these things improve without constant prodding?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know in my heart he has the rest of his life to learn to read and write but only such a short time to be a little boy but I can&#39;t help but feel inferior to the more traditional homeschooling moms.  I see improvement everyday in all my kids.  I am blown away by the things they know.  They have unschooled me a LOT.  Most of all they are happy.  They come in each day dirty head to toe from a day of exploring.  We spend more time scrubbing away dirt from their little bodies then we have ever spent in a workbook.  How do I relax about the basics and scrub away my insecurities?<br/>\n<br/>\nSang,  one thing that has relieved my &quot; officially homeschooling&quot; anxiety is telling myself the kids have always been unschoolers.  They learned to turn over, get up on all fours, crawl, stand, walk and talk.  I watched and marveled at this progression but I didn&#39;t teach them to do it.  The magic official age doesn&#39;t change their ability to continue to learn and grow.

I think I&#39;m doing okay, right now, but I feel like <br/>\n  I&#39;m stumbling blindly.<br/>\n  This is how things usually run:  When he asks questions about something, I <br/>\n  answer from what I know. If he still seems curious or asks more questions, we <br/>\n  usually go to books we have around here (we have a lot). If that doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>\n  be enough or we don&#39;t have a book, we go to the internet and do a Google <br/>\n  search.

I have been on the list several months as a lurker,<br/>\nthis is my first post.  My children are on the younger side too.  Tyler is<br/>\n8, Morgann 6 and Elliott 4, Nevada will be 1 on Sunday.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a lot of the same concerns as you and unfortunately not any answers.<br/>\nI can offer only the comfort that you are not alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes (ok honestly quite often) feel this is so easy I must be doing<br/>\nit wrong.  No struggles over what to do and what not to do...with deep<br/>\nrooted memories of my own school experience, if you don&#39;t hate it and resent<br/>\npracticing it over and over it can&#39;t be important.  I know this is not true<br/>\nbut sometimes the insecurities creep back up.  I wonder ( to myself) as you<br/>\ndo, &quot;How do they measure up with their peers?&quot;  We are the only unschoolers<br/>\nin our homeschool group and it is sometimes hard to keep things in<br/>\nperspective.  I hear stories of all these child prodigies and my 8 year old<br/>\nstill struggles to read.  I know in my heart I am doing what is best for my<br/>\nkids.  So how do we gain the confidence?  I don&#39;t know.  I guess through<br/>\nyears of seeing our children grow and learn we will just relax.  I hope!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to know how other unschoolers have dealt with the insecurities.<br/>\nMy son Tyler loves to read and we read together all the time but he<br/>\nstruggles.   Also writing, I see kids he age writing volumes and we can&#39;t<br/>\nstring a sentence together.  Am I killing his future?  Will these things<br/>\nimprove without constant prodding?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know in my heart he has the rest of his life to learn to read and write<br/>\nbut only such a short time to be a little boy but I can&#39;t help but feel<br/>\ninferior to the more traditional homeschooling moms.  I see improvement<br/>\neveryday in all my kids.  I am blown away by the things they know.  They<br/>\nhave unschooled me a LOT.  Most of all they are happy.  They come in each<br/>\nday dirty head to toe from a day of exploring.  We spend more time scrubbing<br/>\naway dirt from their little bodies then we have ever spent in a workbook.<br/>\nHow do I relax about the basics and scrub away my insecurities?<br/>\n<br/>\nSang,  one thing that has relieved my &quot; officially homeschooling&quot; anxiety is<br/>\ntelling myself the kids have always been unschoolers.  They learned to turn<br/>\nover, get up on all fours, crawl, stand, walk and talk.  I watched and<br/>\nmarveled at this progression but I didn&#39;t teach them to do it.  The magic<br/>\nofficial age doesn&#39;t change their ability to continue to learn and grow.<br/>\nChildren are amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebi<br/>\n<br/>\nunschooling in Fl<br/>\nTyler 8, Morgann 6, Elliott 4 and Nevada 1<br/>\n  ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sanguinegirl83@...\">Sanguinegirl83@...</a><br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, April 21, 2004 5:46 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Younger unschoolers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Oops.
