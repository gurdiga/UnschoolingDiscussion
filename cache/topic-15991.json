The harassment and invasion of privacy didn&#39;t bother<br/>\nme<br/>\n&gt; as much as the statement that I had run someone off, and then the obvious<br/>\n&gt; dalliance of that person in the discussion, with another name (although I<br/>\n&gt; guess Christina would give &quot;Chris&quot; and &quot;Tina&quot; both).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve written to people on the sides in discussions before (not here, not<br/>\n&gt; lately anyway), but it&#39;s usually to clarify that they&#39;re about to<br/>\npotentially<br/>\n&gt; step in deep doody (if i know the folks and issues better than they do and<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re new), or to say something nice to them.  I&#39;ve never written a<br/>\n&gt; spiteful thing on the side in private that way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The central issue, still, is whether who we vote for for president is<br/>\ngoing<br/>\n&gt; to affect all of us as homeschoolers.  I think it will not.  And the<br/>\n&gt; assumption that what a president thinks about birth control will change<br/>\nall<br/>\n&gt; our lives like a door slamming in our faces is no more likely.  The<br/>\npresident<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t a dictator.  He has some appointments and some vetoes and some<br/>\npeople<br/>\n&gt; kissing his butt, but he can be outvoted.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As to homeschooling, people did it in times and places when it was pretty<br/>\n&gt; illegal (and it was never as illegal as some like to pretend it was), and<br/>\n&gt; they were quiet and subtle about things.  If we had to do that again we<br/>\n&gt; could.  If we all had to sign up for co-ops we could.<br/>\n&gt; But we&#39;re not going to have to do that.  And the things people can learn<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; free at unschooling.com (and other places online, from other homeschoolers<br/>\n&gt; who voluntarily share, like people on this list do, but more and cleaner<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; better) are useable no matter who&#39;s president, no matter whether the<br/>\n&gt; president is pro-life, no matter whether other homeschooling families have<br/>\n&gt; 007 video games or raise dogs.  All that stuff is interesting, but not<br/>\n&gt; central to homeschooling.  Some people have a hard time separating object<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; field, and a harder time realizing not all objects are on the same kinds<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; fields.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16051,"nextTopicId":15743}}
