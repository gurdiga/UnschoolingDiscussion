Most people do not realize, for example,  that<br/>\nthey are often paying more on half.com or amazon or B&N, than what they<br/>\nwould on one of the smaller book sites.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I like about choosebooks.com is the  providing free info  to people<br/>\nand I am still amazed at the number of specialists they list.   I thought<br/>\nfolks on this list might be interested too. Most book sellers have only<br/>\nhalf their invenotry on line so they often have books in stock that<br/>\npeople are looking for - if you know who to ask you can  often find a<br/>\nbook.  I suggested that a customer look there for a cook book he wanted<br/>\nat Christmas.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting that you found it on another list.
