The tests measure achievement, as well as <br>preparation \nand readiness for college course work. The scale for scores is 1 <br>to \n36.<br><br>Traditionally schooled students scored 21 in 1998 and 1999.&nbsp; In \nthose two <br>years, home-schooled students scored 22.8 and \n22.7.<br><br>Nationwide, ACT scores have remained constant for the last four \nyears, but <br>the past decade marks the first time that scores have risen \nconsistently, ACT <br>officials said.<br><br>&quot;We haven&#39;t seen a decline in the \nnational average since 1989,&quot; said Richard <br>L.
