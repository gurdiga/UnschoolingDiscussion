Probably ones who are <br/>\nemotionally healthy to begin with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThose who have some emotional healing to do are going to go slower <br/>\nand have a rougher time of it to be sure, but I think those are the <br/>\nones who will benefit from unschooling the most in the long run.  <br/>\nSome people aren&#39;t going to be willing to change or aren&#39;t willing to <br/>\nsee that they need to change, and then it probably won&#39;t work, but <br/>\nI&#39;d like to think that most people want to better themselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI began seeing a homeopath instead of a medical doctor, and she has <br/>\nbeen working on emotional stuff with me.  For example, she noticed <br/>\nthat I was eating for emotional reasons and that was causing some <br/>\nproblems for me.  She started telling me stuff about emotional <br/>\nwholeness that I was ready to &quot;get&quot; because of all the reading I&#39;ve <br/>\ndone here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s been telling me for a long time that I&#39;m not taking care of my <br/>\nown needs enough, and that I need to do some things for myself.  I <br/>\nwas resisting that because I thought that contradicted unschooling.  <br/>\nI&#39;d do things for myself for a few days, then feel guilty that I <br/>\ncould be doing more with my kids, then going back to doing nothing <br/>\nbut kid stuff all day.  What she said sounded right to me, but I <br/>\nreally couldn&#39;t bring myself to do it because I misinterpreted stuff <br/>\nthat was said here about trying to never say no.  I tried to <br/>\nliterally never say no to anything and exhausted myself, but thought <br/>\nI had to keep pushing on if I was going to be a good mom.  When I <br/>\nabsolutely had to say no I felt guilty.  <br/>\n<br/>\nToday has been a huge day for lights going on in my head--I will <br/>\nprobably never forget this day.  I thought I had understood all there <br/>\nwas to understand about unschooling, and here I am seeing it from a <br/>\nwhole different perspective.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo while assertive, emotionally courageous people might get <br/>\nunschooling quicker and easier, unschooling can also help people <br/>\nbecome assertive, emotionally courageous people.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Highly Sensitive people","postDate":"1086225028","msgId":94988,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5My4yYTVjMzMyYS4yZGVmZDQ4NEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":94987,"nextInTopic":94989,"prevInTime":94987,"nextInTime":94989,"topicId":94937,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There s one of those inspirational stories that goes around by e-mail about fitting a bunch of rocks in a big jar.

It&#39;s a lifestyle for all ages.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Certainly the time to devote to multiple interests will vary<br/>\n&gt; according<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the ages and stages of our kids. I just wanted to put in a plug:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t assume that pursuing your personal interests means time away<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children or that it means competing with your children&#39;s interests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And I&#39;d ask any mother: what does interest you? If you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; forgotten, it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; might be time to simply think a bit about it again.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Julie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wow, this has given me a lot to think about!  Thanks for writing this<br/>\n&gt; out.  Now I&#39;m thinking I should be making more of an effort at<br/>\n&gt; pursuing my own interests.  Yet I still feel that pursuing my own<br/>\n&gt; interests WILL be competing with my children&#39;s interests to some<br/>\n&gt; point.  From past experience, I know that they do.  Me pursuing my<br/>\n&gt; own interests almost always results in me telling the kids &quot;No&quot; at<br/>\n&gt; some point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s only 9:30 am and I already have a huge list of what the kids<br/>\n&gt; want to do with me today.  The list will get longer as we go further<br/>\n&gt; on in the day (it always does! lol).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Alisha has asked me if I would play a board game with her and re-do<br/>\n&gt; her mighty beanz house (The mighty beanz aren&#39;t making it through the<br/>\n&gt; tubes the way they should.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Matt wants me to play a board game he made up and he wants me to play<br/>\n&gt; a Spider man board game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Luke wants me to play a game of Somebody and I told him the other day<br/>\n&gt; that I&#39;d look for a book we have about electricity and read it to him<br/>\n&gt; and I still haven&#39;t done that yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have some housework to do because we&#39;re having company tomorrow.<br/>\n&gt; Just the housework itself competes with the kids. Guaranteed they&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; want me to do other things than the things that already have on their<br/>\n&gt; mental list of things to do today, and they&#39;ll tell me they wish I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have to clean up.  (And I&#39;m NOT a neat freak by any stretch of<br/>\n&gt; the imagination!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I need to pause a minute to breathe or I&#39;ll get really overwhelmed<br/>\n&gt; thinking about adding one of my own interests to this day. :)<br/>\n&gt; Because it seems like anytime I start wanting to do stuff for myself<br/>\n&gt; the kids say, &quot;But what about this, this and this that you said you&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; do with us?&quot;  So I put down what I wanted to do and go do this, this,<br/>\n&gt; and this with them.  I tell myself that when they&#39;re done needing me<br/>\n&gt; to play or prepare food or clean up that THEN I&#39;ll get my interest<br/>\n&gt; in.  But when I try doing that they need me until the time they go to<br/>\n&gt; bed.  Then I stay up late to try to squeeze in what I wanted to do<br/>\n&gt; and the next day I&#39;m tired and have to force myself not to be<br/>\n&gt; grumpy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t get when people say, &quot;I do my thing and when they need me, I<br/>\n&gt; stop and help them and then go back to my own thing&quot;.  Because when I<br/>\n&gt; stop to help them they have me helping them all day long.  That&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; an exaggeration.  I thought I had this resolved in my own head, that<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s just the way things are, that I need to accept it and<br/>\n&gt; appreciate that they want to be with me so much, that they won&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt; little forever so appreciate while it lasts.  Now you have me<br/>\n&gt; doubting that again. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When I first read your post yesterday, it really struck a chord with<br/>\n&gt; me.  I can see the truth in what you wrote.  So yesterday I got out<br/>\n&gt; some books that I thought would make some good altered books.  I had<br/>\n&gt; read about people doing this and it interested me a lot.  Of course I<br/>\n&gt; did most of it while staying up really late after the kids went to<br/>\n&gt; bed &lt;grin&gt;  but at least I did it. :)  (I&#39;m TIRED now! lol  I only<br/>\n&gt; got 4 hours of sleep and I need much more than that.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hear the kids out in the livingroom beginning to fight.

I think it was Ren some time ago who pointed <br/>\nout that maybe I just need to work on personal limits, and she&#39;s <br/>\nright.  It was easy when I only knew a James Dobson style of <br/>\nparenting, because I was always in charge of them and didn&#39;t have to <br/>\ntake what they wanted into account very often.  But since I&#39;ve been <br/>\nunschooling, I realized how much I wanted to show them they are <br/>\nimportant and loved.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted them to feel more important and loved than I did as a <br/>\nchild.  I didn&#39;t want to post this because...well, what if my mom <br/>\nreads this someday.  I&#39;m trying to have a good relationship with my <br/>\nmom as an adult and I don&#39;t want to take a chance of upsetting her.  <br/>\nBut it&#39;s just so relavant to why this balance is hard for me so if <br/>\nshe ever reads it I guess she&#39;ll just have to deal with it.  She&#39;s <br/>\nmuch better now that she&#39;s older and on antidepressants. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents were authoritarian and did spank a lot (with a big, thick <br/>\nwooden paddle!) but my mom also used a different kind of <br/>\nmanipulation.  She withheld her love unless I did exactly what she <br/>\nwanted. So I would spend hours running errands around the house for <br/>\nher.  If I did just what she asked, right away, I was just the <br/>\nworld&#39;s best daughter and she loved me.  If I didn&#39;t, she cried.  She <br/>\nsaid she didn&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t love her.  Sometimes she had <br/>\npsychotic type episodes where she thought I was her mother and she <br/>\ncalled me by her mother&#39;s name.  She often told me that if I wasn&#39;t <br/>\nher daughter, she wouldn&#39;t want me to be her friend.  If I argued <br/>\nthat there are people at school, church, etc. who thought I was a <br/>\ngreat kid, she&#39;d say it was because they didn&#39;t know how I really <br/>\nam.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes she ran away from home and wrote letters to my dad, saying <br/>\nthat she was sorry, that she loved him, but she couldn&#39;t stand me and <br/>\nmy brother because we were such terribly behaved kids.  And he&#39;d read <br/>\nthe letters to us and cry and ask us to please try to be good.  She&#39;d <br/>\ncome home later in the day and I&#39;d apologize to her and try even <br/>\nharder to always do everything just right.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother did the opposite of me.  He rebelled and never did <br/>\nanything they wanted him to do.  Once he told me that it didn&#39;t <br/>\nmatter, because they would eventually run out of things to take from <br/>\nhim.  My mom took me to the side sometimes and told me how she hated <br/>\nmy brother.  Once she said she wanted to get a dead bird and put it <br/>\nin his bed so that he&#39;d feel real bad when he turned down the covers. <br/>\nBy watching my brother&#39;s life I knew exactly what life was like for a <br/>\nkid who didn&#39;t always say yes with a smile everytime they asked me <br/>\nto.  I made sure I said yes as much as possible.  Until I met dh and <br/>\ngot engaged at 17, married at 18.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my brother and I fought, my mom couldn&#39;t handle it.  She would <br/>\nchase us, and then run outside and threaten to jump out into the <br/>\nhighway in front of a car and kill herself.  I could only stop her <br/>\nfrom doing it by saying I was going to call a friend of hers and tell <br/>\non her, and then she&#39;d come in and chase us until she exhausted <br/>\nherself and balled herself up into a corner of a dark room and cry <br/>\nlike a child.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t always a very healthy childhood that I had!  I don&#39;t like <br/>\nto complain because it wasn&#39;t all bad, and others had it much worse <br/>\nthan me.  But that gives you an idea of why it&#39;s hard for me to <br/>\ndetermine when I can say yes and when I can say no.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve become consumed with being the best possible mom.  Everything <br/>\nthat was wrong about how my mom parented, I want to do right.  I want <br/>\nmy kids to never, ever, EVER feel sad or unloved or like they have to <br/>\nplease me. My mom always did what she wanted and when she could, she <br/>\nfit us in.  I&#39;ve been trying to do the opposite of that, because I <br/>\nknow what it felt like to be second to a mom&#39;s desires.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I went to the opposite extreme.  I&#39;m going to work on the <br/>\nbalance thing and try to honor myself more throughout the day.

For example, we played <br/>\nLuke&#39;s somebody game this morning, which is like a bunch of little <br/>\ncolorform type body parts that get stuck to your guy&#39;s body.  After <br/>\nthe game is over, the only way to put the pieces back on their mat is <br/>\nto wet them with a damp rag.  It takes longer to put that game away <br/>\nthan most board games.  Alisha and I put our pieces away and Matt and <br/>\nLuke said they didn&#39;t want to put theirs away.  So while I put theirs <br/>\naway, Alisha set up her Tomagutchi game.  I wasn&#39;t quite done yet <br/>\nwhen she was done setting up the game and she was saying, &quot;Come on <br/>\nMom, we&#39;re ready&quot;.  So I said, &quot;Well, I&#39;m still putting the last game <br/>\naway.  If someone can come and help me I&#39;ll be done quicker and can <br/>\nplay faster.&quot;  She did, but she did it while complaining about how <br/>\nit&#39;s not fair that she had to do it because Matt wouldn&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe played Tomagutchi with Matt whining and asking how much longer <br/>\nuntil I could play Operation.  (He wanted to play that instead of <br/>\nSpider man, and then play Spider man and his homemade board game <br/>\nlater).  I just breathed through his whining, because he was really <br/>\nupset that the game he chose was going to be played last.  I just <br/>\nkept patiently saying stuff like, &quot;I know you&#39;re anxious to play, and <br/>\nwe&#39;ll get to it soon&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t play board games together very often because Luke doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave a huge attention span and needs a patient adult to keep him <br/>\ngoing. &quot;Roll the dice now&quot;  &quot;Time to pick up your card now!&quot;  &quot;Okay, <br/>\nnow let&#39;s count the spaces together!&quot;  And Matt and Alisha just don&#39;t <br/>\noften get along together.  Alisha gets very frustrated with both of <br/>\nthem.  When I&#39;m involved I can keep things going more smoothly so she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get so frustrated.  They ARE a handful, so I can see why an <br/>\n11 year old could get frustrated always being the patient, mature <br/>\none.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs soon as Tomagutchi was over, Alisha put it away and I got <br/>\noperation down.  I played Operation with Matt and made sandwiches for <br/>\nus in between my turns.  Alisha and Luke didn&#39;t want to play.  They <br/>\nwent outside to play a pretend Lord of the Rings game.  They asked me <br/>\nif I would play with them when I was done with operation.  I said <br/>\nthat I would be that fairy lady (I couldn&#39;t remember her name or <br/>\nexactly what she was) who showed them their future in the second <br/>\nmovie, and that they could enter my kingdom (inside) and visit me <br/>\nduring the game whenever they wanted to.  They didn&#39;t like that and <br/>\nsaid that that wasn&#39;t actually playing with them.  They begged a <br/>\nlittle, but I explained to Alisha that I really needed some time to <br/>\nrest for a few minutes and then some time to clean up.  She did <br/>\nunderstand I think but was still disappointed.  So, was it okay for <br/>\nme at that point to not go outside and play?  <br/>\n <br/>\n Did you ask them yesterday to say what <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; they wanted to do today and they&#39;ve claimed dibs on &quot;play this <br/>\n </span></blockquote>boardgame&quot; so <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that  you have individual boardgames to play with different <br/>\n </span></blockquote>individuals?   It <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; seems over-scheduled and under-group-shared (just from impressions <br/>\n </span></blockquote>from reading <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, I didn&#39;t ask.  They asked.  Alisha&#39;s needed her house fixed for a <br/>\nfew days now and we just kept running out of day time to do it.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s been disappointed that I haven&#39;t been getting to it, so I <br/>\nreally need to get that done with her today.  So that was one thing <br/>\nwe needed to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe list of games they wanted to play (not a physically written down <br/>\nlist, but a mental list in each of their heads) started yesterday.  <br/>\nWe were out much of the day yesterday.  My dad&#39;s birthday dinner, <br/>\nlibrary, shoe shopping for Matt and we stopped at my dad&#39;s flea <br/>\nmarket and found a Tomagutchi game that Alisha&#39;s been wanting for a <br/>\nlong time.  And since stuff they find at Grandpa&#39;s flea market is <br/>\nusually free to them, we couldn&#39;t turn that down!    When we got home <br/>\nyesterday there wasn&#39;t much time for board game playing, so we said <br/>\nthat we&#39;d play it tomorrow.  Yesterday morning before we had left the <br/>\nhouse to do all these things, Matt had gotten down a board game and <br/>\nasked me to play it but I was running around getting things ready to <br/>\nleave the house and told him we&#39;d play it either at night or the next <br/>\nday.  He said okay, &quot;And could we play Spider Man board game too?&quot;  I <br/>\nsaid okay.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, today&#39;s the next day.  And Luke heard us talking about games we <br/>\nwanted to play and he wanted to pick a game to play too.  So we <br/>\nplayed one game that each of them picked.  Matt still has two more he <br/>\nwants to play today.  I still didn&#39;t do that darn mighty beanz house <br/>\nyet.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe you need to schedule some days of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;nothing,&quot; some days of stillness and quiet.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t usually schedule our days, but my kids usually ask me to do <br/>\nso many things that I can&#39;t do all at once, that I end up <br/>\nsaying, &quot;Well, after I do this with Matt and then this with Luke, <br/>\nI&#39;ll do this with you.  And then after I do that with you, I&#39;ll go <br/>\nand do that other thing that Matt and Luke didn&#39;t want to do.  And <br/>\nthen, if there&#39;s time at the end of the day, we&#39;ll do that other <br/>\nthing.  If there&#39;s not time at the end of the day, we&#39;ll have to do <br/>\nit tomorrow.  And tomorrow they remember what we didn&#39;t do, and a new <br/>\nline of &quot;Can we do this&quot; starts to add to it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can you casually, naturally separate them?  Give one an errand, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>another one a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; puzzle (not jigsaw, some physical one-piece or paper-puzzle) and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>get them <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; engrossed in different things that don&#39;t involve you or each other <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sometimes?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny, because when I casually ask one to do an errand in order <br/>\nto separate them when they&#39;re starting to fight, they have often <br/>\nlooked at me and said, &quot;You&#39;re just saying that because we&#39;re <br/>\nfighting&quot;.  And then I&#39;ll say something like, &quot;Well, it really needs <br/>\nto be done, and I&#39;d really appreciate it.  Plus it would be good for <br/>\nyou two to have a break from each other&quot;  then they&#39;ll say something <br/>\nlike, &quot;No fair!  He should be the one to leave.  He started it!...&quot;  <br/>\nand then refuse to go do whatever I wanted to send them to do.  They <br/>\ndon&#39;t go along with that kind of distraction very easily.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I give them something that doesn&#39;t involve me to do, they&#39;ll <br/>\nsay, &quot;But I don&#39;t want to do this, I want to do ________ with you!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey just came in from their Lord of the Rings game (Darn!  And I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t even start my cleaning yet!)  Oooh!!!  They just said they <br/>\nwant to watch Lord of the Rings again to get more ideas for their <br/>\ngame.  Oh.  Alisha wants me to watch it with them.  I told her that I <br/>\nwould watch it while I was cleaning up, but that I might be in and <br/>\nout of the room some.  I know that she had in mind me sitting with <br/>\none on either side of me, one on my lap, covered up with a blanket <br/>\nand doing nothing but watching the tv.  She accepted my answer but in <br/>\na kind of dejected &quot;Well, okay if that&#39;s all you can give me&quot; kind of <br/>\nway.  I guess I just worry to much.  I don&#39;t want her to feel sad, <br/>\nlike I&#39;m not interested enough in what she wants to do that I don&#39;t <br/>\nwatch the movie with her as closely as she wants me to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Highly Sensitive people","postDate":"1086195905","msgId":94973,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZFQkZCRjgwLUI0QjYtMTFEOC1CNUY5LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGM5a24ycCtxNHFyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGM5a24ycCtxNHFyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":94972,"nextInTopic":94974,"prevInTime":94972,"nextInTime":94974,"topicId":94937,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;ve found that my kids&#39; interests spur my own and vice versa, back and forth between us. My daughter Asa wanted to take violin lessons, and in Suzuki violin, the parent usually learns too. So I found myself renting a violin and playing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star right alongside her. But I started noticing violin music and what kinds I liked and what kinds I didn&#39;t. We found the little violin harmonies in Dixie Chicks songs, and I heard a snip of Vanessa Mae&#39;s classical-with-a-dance-beat and bought the CD. I found myself drawn to fiddling and she and I went to some amazing fiddle concerts and now I&#39;m discovering that I love playing Celtic Fiddle music. It&#39;s something that we do together every day - we play duets and we play separately and we  both share this love of this instrument. I would&#39;ve laughed if someone told me a few years back that I&#39;d be playing the violin - I always considered it such a fussy instrument.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other side, although when I write, I have to be alone, I edit all of my writing when I&#39;m around the kids. Mackenzie sat with me as I read my entire 1st novel aloud and edited it. It was fun to have him with me, and we talked a lot about the plot and characters. Italso  had an interesting side-benefit for him. It let him see that writing is a fluid process - not something you do once and forget about. I remember how astounded he was at how many mistakes I was correcting in my own text and how many parts I decided to rewrite or use a different phrase. And he was more amazed when I was on the 10th revision and still finding stuff. I think it really helped him to start writing more himself (he tends to be a bit of a perfectionist and gets frustrated if things aren&#39;t just the way he imagined them.) After this, he realized that he could always change it after the fact, that it didn&#39;t have to be just right the first time. Also, seeing me go to my adult writer&#39;s group gave him the idea to start a kid&#39;s writer&#39;s group, which has now been going for 2 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the kids&#39; and my interests, we do together. Some of my interests I do while the kids are occupied elsewhere. All of our interests are beneficial to ourselves and to each other, I think. We learn so much from each other and from supporting each other in what we love to do. I never could&#39;ve predicted the amazing stuff we&#39;ve gotten into together, and how much I would enjoy learning from my kids. Unschooling isn&#39;t just for them, it&#39;s for all of us!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"Jennifer","from":"&quot;Jennifer&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Highly Sensitive people","postDate":"1086079787","msgId":94944,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5aGZ2Yis5cWRxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY3LjNiM2M0N2Y4LjJkZWQ1NGVlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":94939,"nextInTopic":94947,"prevInTime":94943,"nextInTime":94945,"topicId":94937,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... other shoe ...

Mostly to myself. <br/>\n Kirby kept coming home to go to work or once, unexpectedly, to go to a <br/>\nmovie.  (They were camping with a large group about 30 miles away.)   I LOVED the <br/>\nquiet.  Given the freedom to put on any music Iiked as loud as I wanted, I <br/>\nspent a lot of time just being amazed at the little noises I heard.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI painted the back doors (French doors and a weirdo big frame) and did a <br/>\nlitle housecleaning, and messed with the yard.  Watched some DVDs and played <br/>\ngames.  Went walking with the dog and a tennis ball.<br/>\n<br/>\nBig chance to pursue my interests, and I was largely interested in just <br/>\ngoofin&#39; off.<br/>\nIT WAS WONDERFUL.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I&#39;m working through what will be fifteen loads of laundry (cloaks one <br/>\nper load; lots of table cloths and dishtowels and cloth napkins and costumes <br/>\nfor five days for four people...) and dishes and cooking stuff and dusty, <br/>\ndusty stuff.  But that&#39;s sweet, beause I didn&#39;t have to live in the dust a bit, <br/>\nand they all still had fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not even an introvert at all.  Even an extrovert can get to the point <br/>\nwhere four days of nobody else seems pretty cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t know until Keith got home noonish and sent Holly to ask me to move <br/>\nthe van that I had never had the keys to the van.  All that time, I thought I <br/>\nhad a vehicle and it was a comfort but I never drove anywhere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s sitting next to me playing Harvest Moon.  All the kids have told me <br/>\nstories of who and what and how and Keith told me lots of stories.  So since <br/>\nthey&#39;ve been back I&#39;ve had input, input, input!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe years of always having a baby on your hip and looking for the other shoe <br/>\nDO pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"Julie Bogart &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Highly Sensitive people","postDate":"1086055645","msgId":94937,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZEMjdCMUEzLUIzNzAtMTFEOC1CNjYwLTAwMEE5NUYwRjU2QUBicmF2ZXdyaXRlci5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":94939,"prevInTime":94936,"nextInTime":94938,"topicId":94937,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There&#39;s a sense in which it <br/>\nsounds like pursuing personal interests means doing *additional* things <br/>\nfor yourself, apart from your kids. I&#39;ve found that if I simply include <br/>\nmy interests in our lives together, then we all participate in each <br/>\nother&#39;s interests. For instance, I will happily play Yu-Gi-Oh cards <br/>\nwith my son, watch That&#39;s So Raven for the millionth time with my <br/>\ndaughter, listen to my other son play his saxophone, discuss my <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s latest book she&#39;s reading and read my oldest son&#39;s email <br/>\nabout song lyric meanings. But I also like to watch Sister Wendy videos <br/>\nabout art history. So I might pop those in after That&#39;s So Raven. I <br/>\nenjoy poetry and tea so we make tea and muffins and read poetry. <br/>\nInterested kids do it with me. And now they love it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI love Shakespeare so we usher at the local Shakespeare festival in <br/>\ntown. My older kids come along and now they enjoy Shakespeare as much <br/>\nas my husband and I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI continue to listen to U2 and read email about the band every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI post on my favorite e-lists and forums.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I&#39;m teaching myself Greek. I just get my books out and do a <br/>\nlittle bit while I sit at the table in the same room as the other kids. <br/>\nMy 7 yr old daughter got interested and has her own &quot;Greek notebook&quot; <br/>\nthat she writes the alphabet in. We enjoyed bird watching this year <br/>\nbecause I love bird watching. I participated in the Project Feeder <br/>\nWatch. My kids knew that and helped me out - just like I help them out <br/>\nin their interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were little, I used to take some time away. My husband <br/>\nwould watch the kids three hours a week and I&#39;d go to the library. I <br/>\nremember that at first, I literally just sat in a private room doing <br/>\nnothing. I would journal a bit or read a magazine, but I mostly just <br/>\nenjoyed quiet. Over time, I started working on getting published and <br/>\nspent some of that time writing, studying or finding markets for my <br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, I dropped the library visits and took guitar lessons once a <br/>\nweek. I would practice guitar during the day when my kids were playing <br/>\nin the living room or outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I am taking this further because it is important to me that our <br/>\nkids see that a lifestyle of learning continues throughout adulthood. <br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t just about knowing our kids well and facilitating <br/>\ntheir interests until they move out.
