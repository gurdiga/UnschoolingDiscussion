Thank you for responding to me!  How long have you been unschooling???  This is all really new to me.

This is all really new to me.  I am just starting <br/>\nhomeschooling this year...although I have known I wanted to do it since my 5 <br/>\nyr. old was born.  I look back now on Camden&#39;s first 4 years...and what I was <br/>\ndoing THEN was unschooling...now...I have been working so hard to be by the <br/>\nbook...it just hasn&#39;t felt right.  Then a friend from my old church told me <br/>\nall about unschooling recently.  I had never heard of the term before, but as <br/>\nsoon as she started to tell me about it...it just clicked!  I&#39;ve always loved <br/>\nto be involved hands on with my kids...now I see how much of a stress <br/>\nreliever it will be to relax a bit!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat type of things do you do with your 5 yr. old as far as schooling??? I <br/>\ncould use any ideas!!!  My son loves to build with Legos, paint, jump on his <br/>\nmini trampoline, climb up our doorframes like Spiderman..hehe.  He loves <br/>\nreading the bible with us, reading period, helping with housework and <br/>\ncooking, etc.  And of course, he loves to be outside!  So...when I just sat <br/>\nback one week and decided to see what he did that I could list as <br/>\nschooling...it was incredible!!  He had more ideas than I thought of through <br/>\nthe week...and they were HIS interests...and not me stopping his creative <br/>\nplay to come and do a workbook.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway.....I could ramble forever...haha.  So...I will just tell you really <br/>\nquickly about myself.  I am 33, my husbands name is Troy and he is a true <br/>\ngift from God.  I told about my childrens ages in the note...we live in <br/>\nMaine.  We attend a baptist church about 1/2 hour from our home!  My husband <br/>\nreally is feeling called to go to bible college...we are praying for God&#39;s <br/>\nguidance with that...because it would be a huge change in our life!!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nTell me more about you and your family!!!  Most of all...we just love the <br/>\nLord and He has been so awesome in our life!!!  Hope to hear from you again <br/>\nsoon!  <br/>\n                                                             :-)  Bridget <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: New Member...looking for Christian support","postDate":"1032731507","msgId":44536,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFtbGUxais4ZG41QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGFtaWw3aitsNTgwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44522,"nextInTopic":44539,"prevInTime":44535,"nextInTime":44537,"topicId":44519,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Bridget!
