Just remember that the little % sign has two zeros for the two <br/>\nzeros in 100.

come up in my &quot;real life&quot; before they were muddied up in school.<br/>\n&gt; I remember, at about age 3, hearing the story of the man who<br/>\n&gt; tricked the Emperor of China - with a chess board and some rice.<br/>\n&gt; The Schtick is that the Emperor was to put one grain of rice on<br/>\n&gt; the first square of the chess board, 2 on the next, then 4, then<br/>\n&gt; 16 - squaring the number of grains for each of the 64 squares.  I<br/>\n&gt; made it all the way across the first row (counting the square<br/>\n&gt; obligingly given me by me grandfather, before I understood that<br/>\n&gt; it worked).  A couple of years later, we had an adding machine in<br/>\n&gt; the house (dating myself here).  My father casually mentioned<br/>\n&gt; that all the multiples of nine had digits that added up to a<br/>\n&gt; multiple of nine.  I probably went through a case of machine tape<br/>\n&gt; exploring that wonder.  And there were always puzzle books<br/>\n&gt; around, written at various grade levels, but full of the<br/>\n&gt; mysteries of how a theorem is proved and what you can do to<br/>\n&gt; calculate how high you threw a ball, with nothing more<br/>\n&gt; significant than a 45 degree angle made by folding the corner of<br/>\n&gt; a piece of typing paper and 2 drinking straws to view along.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the other hand, I am clueless about percentages - at home we<br/>\n&gt; just converted fractions to decimals and went on without thinking<br/>\n&gt; about 30% increase, so when that mess was crammed into my head,<br/>\n&gt; it found no where to live.  But the math that I acquired<br/>\n&gt; naturally, because it was waaaay cool - or because I needed it to<br/>\n&gt; get where I was headed stuck with me forever.  So go back to<br/>\n&gt; squaring one with math trivia and puzzle books and maybe with a<br/>\n&gt; truly math literate friend who will see the math word play<br/>\n&gt; immediately.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;

By the time I<br/>\n&gt; | got to college math, I was seriously phobic because I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; understand<br/>\n&gt; | anything.   And all I cared about was getting a good enough<br/>\n&gt; grade to stay in<br/>\n&gt; | my major.  I took statistics and probability for my Psych<br/>\n&gt; major, and had to<br/>\n&gt; | take it twice.  Then, when I realized I was going to have to<br/>\n&gt; take Advanced<br/>\n&gt; | Stats, I was terrified.  I hired a tutor and all I told him<br/>\n&gt;

People who get all twitchy and have actual<br/>\n&gt; physical reactions to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;math, whose head starts to hurt just thinking about<br/>\n&gt; it, whose eyes glaze<br/>\n&gt; over<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and who physically turn their heads away when<br/>\n&gt; something looks mathy, who<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;such a strong reaction to it that they KNOW they<br/>\n&gt; are anxious about it -<br/>\n&gt; those<br/>\n&gt; &gt;are just the tip of a HUGE iceberg. Most<br/>\n&gt; math-anxious people don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; such<br/>\n&gt; &gt;strong physical or emotional reactions. Most just<br/>\n&gt; sort of shut down when<br/>\n&gt; math<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is brought up. &quot;I understand math okay, I just<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t like it much.&quot; &quot;I just<br/>\n&gt; &gt;mostly avoid math.&quot; &quot;I did fine in math, but never<br/>\n&gt; felt like I really<br/>\n&gt; &gt;understood it.&quot; &quot;I liked arithmetic until we got to<br/>\n&gt; algebra.&quot; These are all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;indications of math anxiety, too. It is truly<br/>\n&gt; epidemic.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2. I have come to believe that MOST adults suffer<br/>\n&gt; from enough math anxiety<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that it holds them back and prevents them from<br/>\n&gt; understanding things they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ought to understand, prevents them from choosing<br/>\n&gt; careers or hobbies that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they&#39;d really enjoy, encourages them to leave<br/>\n&gt; significant technical<br/>\n&gt; decisions<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to other people, disempowers people - makes them<br/>\n&gt; feel powerless and<br/>\n&gt; slightly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;overwhelmed by the world around them, leaves them<br/>\n&gt; unable to intelligently<br/>\n&gt; &gt;consider statistical data so they either give too<br/>\n&gt; much credence to it<br/>\n&gt; (become<br/>\n&gt; &gt;gullible) or too little (say things like,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;statistics can prove anything&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;completely ignore all quantitative evidence JUST<br/>\n&gt; because it is<br/>\n&gt; quantitative).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;3. IT IS NOT THEIR FAULT. Those of us with less<br/>\n&gt; math anxiety are mostly<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lucky!!! Some of us are just extra contrary - I<br/>\n&gt; RECOGNIZED, for example,<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I was being more or less &quot;programmed&quot; to think I<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t do or understand<br/>\n&gt; &gt;math, that it was too hard and too much work and<br/>\n&gt; that girls, especially,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ought to just do their best but not expect too much<br/>\n&gt; from themselves. I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lucky that I had a quiet, but very contrary and<br/>\n&gt; stubborn, nature AND that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was in high school in the 60&#39;s and had a feminist<br/>\n&gt; math teacher. I wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;going to let &quot;the establishment&quot; keep me from doing<br/>\n&gt; something just because<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was a GIRL - so I mentally battled all the math<br/>\n&gt; anxiety that I had (and I<br/>\n&gt; DID<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have a fair amount - especially the kind that says,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;You&#39;re a fake, you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &gt;just memorizing how to do this stuff and you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; relly understand it and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;one of these days they&#39;re going to FIND YOU OUT and<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ll be humiliated.&quot;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Because I worked hard at overcoming the tidal wave<br/>\n&gt; of reasons I shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;understand math, and because I got labeled (by<br/>\n&gt; friends and family) as being<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;good at math,&quot; I just kept trying to understand -<br/>\n&gt; out of FEAR of being<br/>\n&gt; &gt;shamed and of letting people down. So I pushed<br/>\n&gt; through it - but very very<br/>\n&gt; few<br/>\n&gt; &gt;people did. Neither of my sisters survived school<br/>\n&gt; unscathed by extreme math<br/>\n&gt; &gt;anxiety. Both men and women suffer from it. All<br/>\n&gt; this math anxiety is not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;natural.&quot; It was and is still being caused by<br/>\n&gt; schools.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;4. The problem is what is taught. Let me ask you a<br/>\n&gt; couple of questions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Fill in the blank. A negative number multiplied by<br/>\n&gt; another negative number<br/>\n&gt; &gt;gives a _________  answer. (positive) If you know<br/>\n&gt; this - can you explain<br/>\n&gt; why<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it is true?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To change a decimal number to a percentage, what do<br/>\n&gt; you do with the decimal<br/>\n&gt; &gt;point? (.75 becomes 75% -- you move the decimal<br/>\n&gt; point two places to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;right.) Can you easily and quickly explain why?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;How do you divide one fraction by another one?<br/>\n&gt; Invert and multiply. So (1/2<br/>\n&gt; &gt;divided by 1/4) is (1/2 times 4/1) which is 4/2 or<br/>\n&gt; 2. What? Dividing one<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fraction by another one gives you a number bigger<br/>\n&gt; than either of those you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;started with? Why?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;If you can DO these but not explain them, you&#39;re a<br/>\n&gt; victim of school math.<br/>\n&gt; (If<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you refused to even have a look at them - if you<br/>\n&gt; skimmed right past the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;little math questions and didn&#39;t let yourself even<br/>\n&gt; try to think about them,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you&#39;re a victim of school math, too.) If you could<br/>\n&gt; explain them, you are<br/>\n&gt; one<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of the very very few adults who can and I&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt; interested in hearing from<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about how you did get through school with this<br/>\n&gt; ability.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I can read Italian - I can read it with a pretty<br/>\n&gt; darn good accent, even.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Someone taught me the pronunciation &quot;rules&quot; and I<br/>\n&gt; can do it well. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;understand more than a tiny fraction of what I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; reading and I know I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt;almost entirely faking it and it is a worthless<br/>\n&gt; skill for me to have (maybe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;unless I&#39;m an opera singer) and if I read aloud in<br/>\n&gt; Italian to Italians<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>=== message truncated ===<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;When we make a choice we change the future&quot; Deepak Chopra<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I<br/>\nmade it all the way across the first row (counting the square<br/>\nobligingly given me by me grandfather, before I understood that<br/>\nit worked).  A couple of years later, we had an adding machine in<br/>\nthe house (dating myself here).  My father casually mentioned<br/>\nthat all the multiples of nine had digits that added up to a<br/>\nmultiple of nine.  I probably went through a case of machine tape<br/>\nexploring that wonder.  And there were always puzzle books<br/>\naround, written at various grade levels, but full of the<br/>\nmysteries of how a theorem is proved and what you can do to<br/>\ncalculate how high you threw a ball, with nothing more<br/>\nsignificant than a 45 degree angle made by folding the corner of<br/>\na piece of typing paper and 2 drinking straws to view along.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I am clueless about percentages - at home we<br/>\njust converted fractions to decimals and went on without thinking<br/>\nabout 30% increase, so when that mess was crammed into my head,<br/>\nit found no where to live.  But the math that I acquired<br/>\nnaturally, because it was waaaay cool - or because I needed it to<br/>\nget where I was headed stuck with me forever.  So go back to<br/>\nsquaring one with math trivia and puzzle books and maybe with a<br/>\ntruly math literate friend who will see the math word play<br/>\nimmediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Burkfamily@...\">Burkfamily@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 02, 2002 8:12 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Math (was diapers/ was<br/>\ncurriculum)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| I went to Jr. High in the era of &quot;individualized instruction.&quot;<br/>\nWhich meant,<br/>\n| in our school anyway, that we each had headphones, a cassette<br/>\ntape set and a<br/>\n| workbook.

I&#39;ve been tutoring several high school age kids and <br/>\nseveral adults, individually, to help them get ready for various exams that <br/>\nthey want to take (CHSPE and CBEST and SAT). Several things have really <br/>\nstruck me.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Anxiety about math, anxiety that started in primary or secondary school, <br/>\nis REALLY TRULY something that blocks intelligent, motivated peoples&#39; brains <br/>\nfrom being able to learn. Even anxiety that only appears to be a bit mild, <br/>\neven anxiety that people don&#39;t recognize as anxiety, has a HUGE blocking <br/>\naffect. People who get all twitchy and have actual physical reactions to <br/>\nmath, whose head starts to hurt just thinking about it, whose eyes glaze over <br/>\nand who physically turn their heads away when something looks mathy, who have <br/>\nsuch a strong reaction to it that they KNOW they are anxious about it - those <br/>\nare just the tip of a HUGE iceberg. Most math-anxious people don&#39;t have such <br/>\nstrong physical or emotional reactions. Most just sort of shut down when math <br/>\nis brought up. &quot;I understand math okay, I just don&#39;t like it much.&quot; &quot;I just <br/>\nmostly avoid math.&quot; &quot;I did fine in math, but never felt like I really <br/>\nunderstood it.&quot; &quot;I liked arithmetic until we got to algebra.&quot; These are all <br/>\nindications of math anxiety, too. It is truly epidemic. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. I have come to believe that MOST adults suffer from enough math anxiety <br/>\nthat it holds them back and prevents them from understanding things they <br/>\nought to understand, prevents them from choosing careers or hobbies that <br/>\nthey&#39;d really enjoy, encourages them to leave significant technical decisions <br/>\nto other people, disempowers people - makes them feel powerless and slightly <br/>\noverwhelmed by the world around them, leaves them unable to intelligently <br/>\nconsider statistical data so they either give too much credence to it (become <br/>\ngullible) or too little (say things like, &quot;statistics can prove anything&quot; and <br/>\ncompletely ignore all quantitative evidence JUST because it is quantitative).<br/>\n<br/>\n3. IT IS NOT THEIR FAULT. Those of us with less math anxiety are mostly just <br/>\nlucky!!! Some of us are just extra contrary - I RECOGNIZED, for example, that <br/>\nI was being more or less &quot;programmed&quot; to think I couldn&#39;t do or understand <br/>\nmath, that it was too hard and too much work and that girls, especially, <br/>\nought to just do their best but not expect too much from themselves. I was <br/>\nlucky that I had a quiet, but very contrary and stubborn, nature AND that I <br/>\nwas in high school in the 60&#39;s and had a feminist math teacher. I wasn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to let &quot;the establishment&quot; keep me from doing something just because I <br/>\nwas a GIRL - so I mentally battled all the math anxiety that I had (and I DID <br/>\nhave a fair amount - especially the kind that says, &quot;You&#39;re a fake, you&#39;re <br/>\njust memorizing how to do this stuff and you don&#39;t relly understand it and <br/>\none of these days they&#39;re going to FIND YOU OUT and you&#39;ll be humiliated.&quot;) <br/>\nBecause I worked hard at overcoming the tidal wave of reasons I shouldn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand math, and because I got labeled (by friends and family) as being <br/>\n&quot;good at math,&quot; I just kept trying to understand - out of FEAR of being <br/>\nshamed and of letting people down. So I pushed through it - but very very few <br/>\npeople did. Neither of my sisters survived school unscathed by extreme math <br/>\nanxiety. Both men and women suffer from it. All this math anxiety is not <br/>\n&quot;natural.&quot; It was and is still being caused by schools.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. The problem is what is taught. Let me ask you a couple of questions. <br/>\n<br/>\nFill in the blank. A negative number multiplied by another negative number <br/>\ngives a _________  answer. (positive) If you know this - can you explain why <br/>\nit is true?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo change a decimal number to a percentage, what do you do with the decimal <br/>\npoint? (.75 becomes 75% -- you move the decimal point two places to the <br/>\nright.) Can you easily and quickly explain why?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you divide one fraction by another one? Invert and multiply. So (1/2 <br/>\ndivided by 1/4) is (1/2 times 4/1) which is 4/2 or 2. What? Dividing one <br/>\nfraction by another one gives you a number bigger than either of those you <br/>\nstarted with? Why?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can DO these but not explain them, you&#39;re a victim of school math. (If <br/>\nyou refused to even have a look at them - if you skimmed right past the <br/>\nlittle math questions and didn&#39;t let yourself even try to think about them, <br/>\nyou&#39;re a victim of school math, too.) If you could explain them, you are one <br/>\nof the very very few adults who can and I&#39;d be interested in hearing from you <br/>\nabout how you did get through school with this ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can read Italian - I can read it with a pretty darn good accent, even. <br/>\nSomeone taught me the pronunciation &quot;rules&quot; and I can do it well. I don&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand more than a tiny fraction of what I&#39;m reading and I know I&#39;m <br/>\nalmost entirely faking it and it is a worthless skill for me to have (maybe <br/>\nunless I&#39;m an opera singer) and if I read aloud in Italian to Italians they&#39;d <br/>\ndiscover I was a fake right away (probably by the mistakes in my intonation - <br/>\nI&#39;d put emphasis in the wrong places in the sentences since I don&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand what I&#39;m reading.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools actually TEACH kids to do math in an equivalent way. They teach rules <br/>\nto follow, they teach HOW to do arithmetic, to kids who don&#39;t understand what <br/>\nthey&#39;re doing - the kids practice adding and subtracting, multiplying and <br/>\ndividing, reducing fractions and finding &quot;greatest common factors&quot; and <br/>\nworking with negative numbers and all the rest of that - as if learning the <br/>\nrules for manipulating numbers was the same as learning math. That is no more <br/>\ntrue than learning the rules for pronouncing Italian words is the same as <br/>\nlearning the Italian language. <br/>\n<br/>\n5. The problem is also WHEN stuff is taught.<br/>\nKids need to develop their math understanding - to have opportunities to <br/>\ndevelop understanding of concepts - before they learn computation rules and <br/>\nmethods. They need to learn techniques at the right time - when the need <br/>\ncomes up as a natural outgrowth of fooling with the concepts. If they haven&#39;t <br/>\nreally given any thought yet to what happens and what it really means when <br/>\ndividing one fraction by another fraction, but, because it is on the school <br/>\nschedule, they are taught to divide one fraction by another by inverting and <br/>\nmultiplying, then that&#39;s it - they move on to something else. They may or may <br/>\nnot remember the technique later (since it was taught out of context and <br/>\nbefore they could understand why it works) and they likely will never ever <br/>\nagain think about what is really happening when dividing one fraction by <br/>\nanother fraction. They never developed or investigated the concept, but <br/>\nthey&#39;ve &quot;learned&quot; how to do it (whatever IT really is - they don&#39;t really <br/>\nknow) and few people will EVER really consider the question again - <br/>\nespecially since most will have developed significant math anxiety by that <br/>\ntime or shortly thereafter and will NOT think pondering what dividing one <br/>\nfraction by another really means is any fun at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nMore to come - I&#39;ve run out of time this morning.....<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d REALLY like to hear your comments on these ideas, including your own <br/>\nexperiences.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam sorooshian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36693,"nextTopicId":36704}}
