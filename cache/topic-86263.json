One of my teachers did the &quot;alligator&quot; <br/>\nthing - the smaller alligator always eats the bigger alligator. I&#39;ve also heard <br/>\nof the opposite: the bigger number always &quot;shoots&quot; the smaller one. I always <br/>\nhad great difficulty remembering the mnemonics (meta-mnemonics, anyone?), and <br/>\nhow exactly they worked. (Similar to other concepts that require, but <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t, my forethought: reading an analog clock, knowing the order of the months <br/>\nand alphabets, remembering holidays, how old I am, etc.)<br/>\nAbout a year ago, I finally figured it out. It wasn&#39;t about alligators or <br/>\nrighteous gunmen, it was all about encoding: less-than was literally &lt;, or the <br/>\nstart of an element, and greater-than &gt;, the end of an element. It was so <br/>\nsimple, so blantantly obvious, it borders on the power of an epiphany.<br/>\nWhat interests me most, though, is hearing what mnemonic teachers are using <br/>\nnowadays. With kids always knowing more about computers than older folk, are <br/>\nHTML and similar markups prevalent enough to make this a more palatable <br/>\ncomparison?
