If she actually DOES play Barbies or house for two hours,<br/>\nthat <br/>\nwas negotiation, not manipulation.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with that.  It&#39;s all about working things out.  Give and take.<br/>\nI&#39;ll do this for you, if you&#39;ll do that for me.  But it wasn&#39;t like that.<br/>\nThe mom agreed to only go to the hotdog place.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I have physically carried kids before, mostly out, rather than in.   With<br/>\n<br/>\nreally young kids who arent&#39; so far removed from being carried by their mom,<br/>\nit&#39;s <br/>\nnot so off.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKids can be having a great time sometimes and not want to leave when you<br/>\nreally have to go.  But what drives me nuts with some people is that they<br/>\ndon&#39;t give the kids warning, they don&#39;t talk to the kids,  they don&#39;t<br/>\nreflect their feelings back to them, letting them know they understand how<br/>\nhard it is to leave when they are having fun, they often just pick them up<br/>\nkicking and screaming and take them out.  Even the smallest child feels<br/>\nbetter when you reflect their feelings back to them and tell them you<br/>\nunderstand and maybe help them to plan ahead when they can come back again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;So a slump, whether it lasts days with a teen or minutes with a toddler,<br/>\ncan <br/>\nbe overcome by persuasion and inspiration, and if a mom is honest and says<br/>\n&quot;I <br/>\nthink you&#39;ll have fun, let&#39;s at least go and try for a minute,&quot; that&#39;s a <br/>\nuseful mom thing to do.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with this.

If I knew it<br/>\nwas pretty likely that my child would change his mind about wanting to go<br/>\nsomewhere at the last minute, I would only accept invitations to things that<br/>\nit&#39;s o.k. to not go to at the last minute.

That happens at my house.  And my son is remarkably resistant <br/>\nto coaxing.   I&#39;m working a bit on figuring out at the end of outings <br/>\nwhat was enjoyable and what was just endurable.  (Say we went to a <br/>\nmuseum with friends enjoyed 20% of the museum exhibits and 95% of the <br/>\nfriends.  I&#39;m aiming to figure out how to make future outings and <br/>\nplaydates better, so that he can look forwards to them.  When he&#39;s <br/>\nreluctant, I&#39;d like to know what his concerns are more clearly.  But my <br/>\nkid is almost 11, he can explain himself really well, if he has specific <br/>\nconcerns and not just free-floating anxiety.)<br/>\n<br/>\n**but I just can&#39;t sleep when my 5 year old&#39;s up.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t either when my son was that young.  But maybe my kid was more <br/>\nclingy at that age?  He wouldn&#39;t stay up alone (so siblings).  But I <br/>\nthink that advice that has been offered here about kids staying up alone <br/>\nis mostly aimed at kids older than 5.  (And I really can&#39;t imagine 3 <br/>\nyear olds staying up alone.)  I agree that I&#39;m not comfortable with <br/>\nyoung kids having lots of time awake when the parental supervision has <br/>\nfallen asleep.  (My ten going on eleven year old&#39;s &quot;staying up pattern&quot; <br/>\nis just watching one TV episode and going to bed.  He&#39;s not cooking, <br/>\nbathing, playing in the street, or running with scissors &lt;g&gt; while I&#39;m <br/>\nsleeping.  At least that&#39;s not the plan.)  Some people may have a much <br/>\nhigher tolerance for risk than I do, or more adept children, or more <br/>\nchildproof homes.  My 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\n**I genuinely am getting tired of them complaining about going to bed <br/>\nevery night.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you should examine your feelings and try to figure out why you <br/>\naren&#39;t comfortable with their feelings.  (I haven&#39;t had to listen to it, <br/>\nand I&#39;m not you, so I don&#39;t know.)  Do you want them to have different <br/>\nfeelings, different behavior, or to just get through the bedtime <br/>\nresistance faster?  A more pleasant bedtime would be great for <br/>\neverybody.  Are there other ways (than staying up forever) that you can <br/>\ncontribute to making it more pleasant?<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\n**but I can&#39;t get around the &quot;What if he falls asleep in the tub&quot; <br/>\nthoughts going through my head.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think he&#39;ll fall asleep if he is taking a stand up shower.  If <br/>\nhe slips you wouldn&#39;t be there much faster awake or asleep.  (Unless you <br/>\nnormally stay in the bathroom with him.)  BUT, my husband had huge <br/>\ninsomnia Thursday night and did fall asleep in the bathtub Friday night <br/>\nright after getting home from work and 36 hours of being awake.  <br/>\nFortunately he&#39;s pretty tightly wedged in there and couldn&#39;t slip down <br/>\nunder the water.)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7603095,"authorName":"xochitl24","from":"&quot;xochitl24&quot; &lt;xochitl24@...&gt;","profile":"xochitl24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"manipulation and hot dogs, was Re: Manipulation... ????

He was asleep when I worked all this out, the <br/>\n&gt; morning of the playdate, but I figured a playdate at a house with <br/>\n&gt; different toys would be just as much fun as a children&#39;s museum.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He woke up and said he wasn&#39;t going.

Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have made <br/>\n&gt; a change in plans without his consent, but honestly, he really wanted <br/>\n&gt; to go on this playdate the day before, and I think he would have <br/>\n&gt; said &quot;I&#39;m not going&quot; even if the plans hadn&#39;t changed at all.  He <br/>\n&gt; does the &quot;I&#39;m not going&quot; thing quite often before we go somewhere.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I bribed him with stopping for a hot dog and hot chocolate at a <br/>\n&gt; Turkey Hill on the way (He loves hot dogs).

If I had said, &quot;No, we&#39;re going to do <br/>\n&gt; both&quot;, I couldn&#39;t have gotten him in the car.

We got there and he refused to go <br/>\n&gt; in. I carried him in thinking that if he saw the toys and his friend <br/>\n&gt; he&#39;d be okay.  He ran out of the house and back into the car. So I <br/>\n&gt; told him I wanted to go in and that he could wait in the car.  The <br/>\n&gt; house was out in the country, I parked right by the front door, and I <br/>\n&gt; sat by a window in the house where I could see the car.  He sat out <br/>\n&gt; in the car for I&#39;d say 20 minutes before he came in.  I went out to <br/>\n&gt; check on him once, the little girl went out to ask him if he wanted <br/>\n&gt; to play, the other mom went out to try to tempt him with toys.

He <br/>\nknew about it and was excited about it the day before.  We were <br/>\nsupposed to meet 2 of his friends at a children&#39;s museum but it <br/>\ndidn&#39;t work out for one of them and so the other one invited us to <br/>\ntheir house to play.  He was asleep when I worked all this out, the <br/>\nmorning of the playdate, but I figured a playdate at a house with <br/>\ndifferent toys would be just as much fun as a children&#39;s museum.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe woke up and said he wasn&#39;t going.  What was I going to do?  I <br/>\nreally didn&#39;t feel comfortable calling back and saying, &quot;Ooops, so <br/>\nsorry, he doesn&#39;t want to come anymore&quot;.  Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have made <br/>\na change in plans without his consent, but honestly, he really wanted <br/>\nto go on this playdate the day before, and I think he would have <br/>\nsaid &quot;I&#39;m not going&quot; even if the plans hadn&#39;t changed at all.  He <br/>\ndoes the &quot;I&#39;m not going&quot; thing quite often before we go somewhere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I bribed him with stopping for a hot dog and hot chocolate at a <br/>\nTurkey Hill on the way (He loves hot dogs).  He said he&#39;d go to the <br/>\nturkey hill but not to the house.  I said okay, knowing at least it <br/>\nwould get him in the car.  If I had said, &quot;No, we&#39;re going to do <br/>\nboth&quot;, I couldn&#39;t have gotten him in the car. But after we got the <br/>\nhot dog I said, &quot;Let&#39;s just go to their house and if you don&#39;t like <br/>\nit you don&#39;t have to stay long&quot;.  We got there and he refused to go <br/>\nin. I carried him in thinking that if he saw the toys and his friend <br/>\nhe&#39;d be okay.  He ran out of the house and back into the car. So I <br/>\ntold him I wanted to go in and that he could wait in the car.  The <br/>\nhouse was out in the country, I parked right by the front door, and I <br/>\nsat by a window in the house where I could see the car.  He sat out <br/>\nin the car for I&#39;d say 20 minutes before he came in.  I went out to <br/>\ncheck on him once, the little girl went out to ask him if he wanted <br/>\nto play, the other mom went out to try to tempt him with toys.  He <br/>\neventually came in and warmed up to everything and had a wonderful <br/>\ntime.  He didn&#39;t want to leave when it was time to go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I manipulated him I guess, by tempting him with a hot dog and <br/>\ngoing in the house and letting him in the car, knowing that he&#39;d want <br/>\nto come and join me eventually.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI manipulate my kids almost every time they give me the &quot;I&#39;m not <br/>\ngoing&quot; &quot;Why can&#39;t we just stay home&quot; stuff before something we <br/>\nplanned to do.  (And I don&#39;t over-schedule stuff at all, so that&#39;s <br/>\nnot the issue--they just like to stay home).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother time when I think I manipulate a bit is at bedtime.  They <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to go to bed, but I do.   Yet they want me to tuck them <br/>\nin, including reading to each of them individually, singing to them, <br/>\netc.  If I don&#39;t start tucking in before midnight, I&#39;m up until 3 am <br/>\nor later, and I need to go to bed earlier than that sometimes.  If <br/>\nI&#39;m not going to be grumpy while I&#39;m helping them get to sleep, it&#39;s <br/>\ngot to be earlier than that.  Lately they&#39;ve been whining &quot;Oh, not <br/>\nyet!&quot;  when I say I&#39;m ready to start tucking someone in.  So I <br/>\nsay, &quot;Okay, but I&#39;m going to bed.  You can stay up if you want, but <br/>\nthen you won&#39;t be tucked in&quot;.  And they do NOT want to go to bed <br/>\nwithout being tucked in so they grudgingly allow me to do it.  I&#39;m <br/>\ngetting sick of hearing, &quot;It&#39;s not fair, I&#39;m not tired yet, why do I <br/>\nhave to get tucked in before him, etc.&quot; every night.  Is it <br/>\nmanipulative for me to say, &quot;If you want to be tucked in, it has to <br/>\nbe now, because I&#39;m not going to stay up until 3 am tonight. You can <br/>\nstay up on your own if you want&quot;, when I know very well that they <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to stay up on their own and they will go to bed when I say <br/>\nbecause they want to be tucked in.  If I don&#39;t manipulate them into <br/>\ngoing to bed earlier than they want, they manipulate me into staying <br/>\nup later than I want.  Both happens, and it&#39;s manipulation either <br/>\nway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the other night, my 5 year old wanted to take a shower at 1 am <br/>\nand I was going to bed.  I&#39;m not comfortable with him being in the <br/>\ntub while I&#39;m asleep.  I *can&#39;t* sleep with him in the shower.  I <br/>\nactually can&#39;t sleep when he&#39;s awake at all.  My other two (older) <br/>\nkids I&#39;m okay with them being up later than me, but I just can&#39;t <br/>\nsleep when my 5 year old&#39;s up.  I outright refused to turn the shower <br/>\nwater on for him and told him that he can&#39;t take a shower when I&#39;m in <br/>\nbed.  I told him I&#39;d help him get the shower water on in the morning, <br/>\nbut not now.  So that&#39;s an arbitrary rule I have going for him I <br/>\nguess.  His 11 year old sister could get up and take a shower while <br/>\nI&#39;m asleep and I&#39;m cool with that.  Luke gets an arbitrary, &quot;No, you <br/>\ncannot take a shower if there aren&#39;t any adults awake in the house&quot;.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t like having that rule, but I can&#39;t get around the &quot;What if he <br/>\nfalls asleep in the tub&quot; thoughts going through my head.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI genuinely am getting tired of them complaining about going to bed <br/>\nevery night.  It feels like I&#39;m making them go to bed, even though <br/>\nthey know they have the freedom to stay up longer than me if they <br/>\nwant to.  I really would like things to go more smoothly, and I would <br/>\nreally like them to not look back on their childhoods with memories <br/>\nof me manipulating them into going to bed earlier than they wanted <br/>\nto.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"Deb Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Manipulation... ????

Sometimes I need a vocabulary lesson &lt;g&gt;.  I do definitely agree that the word manipulate has negative connotations to it.  But I have been at a loss for a word that equals that without the negativism.  &quot;Communicate&quot; I am not sure carries the same idea of being a strategy to meet a need, but I think all together the list does.  But, does persuade have a negative feel to it too?  What about influence?  In any case, I am happy to have a bigger bag of words from which to pull.  And yes, I absolutely agree that the thoughtful choice of words makes communication efficient and effective and shows caring about the people involved and the subject matter.  It is definitely important.  Though sometimes I think people attribute their own unique nuances to words.  Like differing cultures do, but I think this happens even within micro or sub cultures as well.  I&#39;ve found that saying the words sir or maam bring smiles to faces where I am from, however, they are likely to get you slapped where my husband is from.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow is this related to unschooling?  I am not sure, but it is interesting discussion anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Has anyone read <br/>\nanything on Buddhism and the way they view emotions and human <br/>\nactions? Do you know what I am trying to hint at here? Cuz I&#39;m <br/>\nhaving a heck of a hard time putting it into words. Maybe someone <br/>\nelse might know what I am very poorly trying to get at...&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not read anything on Buddhism past what I learned in a college comparative religion class.  Yet I believe NVC philosophy is loosely similar.  NVC believes that all actions are in attempt to meet needs, and see detriment in conversation to apply judgment to actions, outside of the context of one&#39;s own opinions.  I am not sure I can express any better than you have, but I think I hear what you are saying.  I agree that sometimes I have heard the word manipulation used in ways that it really didn&#39;t sound negative, and perhaps sometimes the tone and/or context in which a word is used holds as much weight and meaning for the word as the simple definition alone.  I am thinking now after more thought that my words above about nuance in culture is what is at work here.  In Buddhist and NVC culture, manipulation would probably be defined as strategy to meet needs, and not carry a negative tone.  But I agree with Pam and Sandra and others here that in the popular culture the word has a negative meaning related to being sneaky or .... perhaps strategy to meet needs that disregards the needs of others.  Meaning, the manipulator attempts to influence the behavior of another person to his own benefit, without regard for the probably negative impact on that other person.  Very different meanings, attributable to differences in culture.  I personally prefer to live (in my consciousness) within the NVC culture, but I do physically need to live and get along in the popular culture.  I think that choosing to not hear the negative aspect of such words helps subscribers to the philosophy to live with more internal peace and to affect less violence on the world around them.  I think this applies to unschooling in that I personally find it to be a nicer environment in which to grow up, hearing and respecting the needs of others without violent thoughts, as opposed to school culture which is full of judgment and criticism and shame and pressure and violence.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan, am I getting close at all?<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, February 19, 2005 4:12 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Manipulation... ????

(I remember asking whether one <br/>\nactivity could be moved from Sat to Sun, and whether my brother could <br/>\ntake BART to get either to or from the activity that she was taking him <br/>\nto.  The rest of it is gone from my memory, but the word &quot;manipulative&quot; <br/>\nis burned in, because I was so surprised at the put down and I didn&#39;t <br/>\nthink it was fair.)

They are attempting to manipulate their environments to get their needs met.  They are crying because they need to be held, or whatever.  Later they may cry not simply as an expression of sadness but because they are trying to communicate that they have a need and want someone to attend to it.  If the child is hungry, this is clearly not a negative thing.  But they are trying to affect others&#39; behaviors to meet their own needs.  What is this if not manipulation?  Even in situations that would normally be seen in a negative light, such as a toddler or preschooler &quot;acting out&quot; to get the parents attention.  They are trying to meet their own need for more attention from the parents and are willing to be persistent and try out all sorts of strategies to get those needs met.  I see that as a great thing.  So while I agree that the word manipulation is going to have a negative connotation attached to it, I feel sad about that and regret it, because I do not know of a positive connotation counterpart word.  Maybe strategizing?  I am not sure at what point taking efforts to meet our own needs became such an ugly thing?  Are we supposed to be forever self-less?  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;:&quot; I wish I had someone who could help me with <br/>\nlaundry. It&#39;s so hard to do this all the time on my own when I can <br/>\nbarely get up and down the stairs.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI also don&#39;t see this as being a problematic way to communicate that you need help.  YOu are stating that it is hard for you and that you wish you had help.  What is wrong with that?  Now, if you were saying it with a tone of shame, that would be different, but stating it as a wish rather than a demand leaves your son to have compassion for you and then to either choose to help or not.  I think you might be too hard on yourself for this.  It is okay to ask for help directly, and I think it is okay to just state you are having a hard time and then leave it to others to deduce an action that might be helpful to you.  Another alternative helpful action your son could have taken would be to move your landry machines upstairs :-)  Maybe not realistic, but it&#39;s another strategy he could have used to help you from his own heart, which might have been inspired by your comment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething to think about.<br/>\nDeborah<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Manipulation... ????

Not in a <br/>\nmean, nasty way. It&#39;s not like a conscious thing most people do. We <br/>\nlearned it as children... actually, I think we just figured it out. <br/>\nAnd then we just grew up with it and developed it. It&#39;s not a word <br/>\nto be avoided because so much can be learned about oneself from it. <br/>\nHow do I do this? Why? Do I know I am doing this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a radio show that has a Buddhist monk on it. I can&#39;t <br/>\nremember the monk&#39;s name, I&#39;m so sorry. But he talked about how we <br/>\nall use manipulation and that people have really thrown it into such <br/>\na negative light they don&#39;t see it for what it is. It is the art of <br/>\ngetting one&#39;s needs met according to one&#39;s personal ideals. Mostly <br/>\nthey are such an undercurrent and so everyday, the person is not <br/>\naware of it. His idea was that one should not fear it or get angry <br/>\nover the word and give it a negative tone unless it something that <br/>\nyou do fear because you do it yourself. Follow me? I hope I&#39;m being <br/>\nclear with this. Pardon if it&#39;s confusing. <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, to get to know yourself and how you function (many times <br/>\nthrough mistakes, embarrassing moments, or small lessons in the <br/>\nmundane) we accidentally discover our forms of mild to major <br/>\nmanipulation and how to deal with them accordingly, if at all. It <br/>\nwas quite interesting and wish I had more information to give you <br/>\nall about that radio show and the monk. But wouldn&#39;t it be <br/>\ninteresting to understand bettet?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I use manipulation and I&#39;m not thrilled when I do it. It&#39;s <br/>\nembarrassing and feels negative to me. I caught myself doing this <br/>\nwhen I first became ill. I wanted help and needed help but wasn&#39;t <br/>\nuse to asking for it and wasn&#39;t use to telling my son I expected it <br/>\nfrom him, so it went something like this: I wanted my son to do the <br/>\nlaundry and he&#39;s playing games. Instead of just asking him to do the <br/>\nlaundry after he&#39;s done with the level he was on, I would say <br/>\nsomething like:&quot; I wish I had someone who could help me with <br/>\nlaundry. It&#39;s so hard to do this all the time on my own when I can <br/>\nbarely get up and down the stairs.&quot; What was that all about? Why did <br/>\nI feel I would be getting a better response from him than being <br/>\ndirect? Where did I learn it? Did it just develop naturally because <br/>\nit&#39;s a human thing to do? <br/>\n<br/>\nI analyzed it, apologized to my son about it and then we talked <br/>\nabout it. I don&#39;t do that anymore...it took realizing it, though, <br/>\nand not being afraid to admit it to myself. Though it stings. A <br/>\nfriend of mine pointed out that all we (people as a whole) do is <br/>\nmanipulate. He didn&#39;t mean it in a negative tone, either. So... can <br/>\nwe really call it all manipulation? Isn&#39;t it interesting how hung up <br/>\nwe get on a word? Does it have that much power or only the power we <br/>\ngive it?<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay... spent enough time on the putie for the day... you all take <br/>\ncare!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103794,"nextTopicId":103828}}
