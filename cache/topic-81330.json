It deals with the heart of <br/>\nwhat Sandra stated in this part of her post. I am currently rereading the book <br/>\nfor the umpteenth time, and I have just read the part dealing with the very <br/>\nnature of a baby&#39;s reality in his or her own continuum. She writes in matters <br/>\nconcerning a newborn infant; &quot;Again, the quality of his awareness is very <br/>\ndifferent from what it will become. He cannot qualify his impression of how things <br/>\nare. Either they are right or not right. Requirements are strict at this early <br/>\ndate. As we have seen, he cannot hope, if he is uncomfortable now, that he <br/>\nwill be comfortable later. He cannot feel that &quot;mother will be right back&quot; when <br/>\nshe leaves him; the world has suddenly gone wrong, conditions are intolerable. <br/>\nHe hears and accepts his own weeping, but although his mother knows the sound <br/>\nand its meaning since time immemorial, and so does any child or adult who <br/>\nhears it, he does not. He only senses that it is a positive action toward setting <br/>\nthings right. But if he is left to cry for too long, if the response it is <br/>\nmeant to elicit does not come, that feeling departs as well, giving way to utter <br/>\nbleakness without time or hope. When his mother does come to him, he simply <br/>\nfeels right, he is not aware that she has been away, nor does h e remember <br/>\nhaving cried. He is reconnected to his lifeline and his environment meets his <br/>\nexpectations. When he is abandoned, put out of his continuum of correct <br/>\nexperience, nothing is acceptable, and nothing is accepted. Want is all there is, there <br/>\nis nothing to use, to grow on, to fulfill his requirement for experience, for <br/>\nthe experiences must be expected ones...&quot; and a little while later she writes; <br/>\n&quot;If he feels safe, wanted, and &quot;at home&quot; in the midst of activity before he <br/>\ncan think, his view of later experiences will be very distinct in character <br/>\nfrom those of a child who feels unwelcome, unstimulated by the experiences he has <br/>\nmissed, and accustomed to living in a state of want, though the later <br/>\nexperiences of both may be identical. At first, the infant only notices; he cannot <br/>\nreason. He becomes familiar with his surroundings by association. At the very <br/>\noutset, in the first postnatal messages brought in by the senses, there is an <br/>\nabsoluteness, an unqualified impression of the state of things, relative to <br/>\nnothing but the innate expectations of the infant and, of course, devoid of any <br/>\nrelation to the passage of time.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSo Sandra&#39;s hypothetical baby cries from its innate expectations. Gradually <br/>\nthe baby learns that certain actions elicit a positive response. If those <br/>\ninnate expectations were not present at or even before birth, then babies since <br/>\ntime immemorial would have no need to cry until someone taught them that they <br/>\nshould expect some things to happen. As it is, babies, all of them, have a <br/>\nnatural expectation that food and warmth are basic requirements in their continuum, <br/>\nand if not met, they cry. At first not knowing why they cry or even <br/>\nremembering that they did cry, but gradually learning that the cry begets a response. A <br/>\nyoung baby without the power of reason cannot hope to know the passage of <br/>\ntime, as it has no experience of time. It isn&#39;t until much later that time has <br/>\nmeaning in dealing with the basic needs. An infant has no knowledge of time only <br/>\nthat something is either right or wrong, good or bad at this moment. A five <br/>\nyear old has a much better concept, yet still not fully realized. A promise of a <br/>\nspecial want at a future date (to use Liedloff&#39;s example, a bike at Christmas <br/>\npromised in August) means little to a five year old, almost as if there were <br/>\nno promise at all, but hope is beginning to be established. As hope can only <br/>\nbe established with the passage and realization of time. For without time there <br/>\nis no hope. An infant knows no time, therefore has no hope, but does have <br/>\ninnate expectations. A ten year old on the other hand experiences time better and <br/>\ncan understand August, September, October, November, December. Although for a <br/>\nten year old, the wait, the hope, is still prolonged. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you haven&#39;t read the book, I strongly suggest doing so. But that is just <br/>\nmy two cents. &lt;g&gt; I could be way off track in interpreting what you were trying <br/>\nto say.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nHe felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered <br/>\nwhose it was and whether they were enjoying it.<br/>\nDouglas Adams <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3270790,"authorName":"JenV72","from":"&quot;JenV72&quot; &lt;jvaitkus@...&gt;","profile":"JenV72","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Learning Lessons from life","postDate":"1064375116","msgId":81382,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJrcjQwYytyN2UxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJrcW9yZStnZHUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":81381,"nextInTopic":81411,"prevInTime":81381,"nextInTime":81383,"topicId":81330,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Julie, I do understand your points.

Rainforests will be destroyed so that she and her peers, at 21, <br/>\ncan have a cappucino before their first college class of the day.  That could <br/>\nbe considered bad, especially by the inhabitants of the rainforest.  (And no, <br/>\nI&#39;m not in favor of  depriving starving babies, North American or otherwise.  <br/>\nStick with me, I&#39;m trying to get to the &quot;useful&quot; part.)  Eventually, because <br/>\nI&#39;m told that the planet needs the biological diversity found in rainforests <br/>\n(and in other ecosystems that we often destroy for our food and our raw <br/>\nmaterials), this will be bad for the survival of the planet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that crying baby belongs to the !Kung in Africa, however, she will have <br/>\nvery little ecological impact -- her people still live within the limits of the <br/>\necosystem, still control their population and the damage they do to the <br/>\nenvironment.  That could be considered to be, if not good, at least not harmful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point:  much of the &quot;beliefs&quot; discussion on this list has dealt with world <br/>\nreligions that are only six to eight thousand years old -- a blip on the <br/>\nscreen when it comes to the whole of human history that could inform our beliefs.  <br/>\nBecause the major world religions (Hinduism, a variation of which Judie <br/>\nseemed to be espousing; Buddhism, Jainism, Taoism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, <br/>\nChristianity, Islam, neo-Paganism, if not Paganism  -- I&#39;m most certainly missing <br/>\nsome) have all come about in cultures in which humans were not living within the <br/>\nlaws of the community of life, they have all had to address humans as flawed <br/>\nbeings, as capable of evil, which many of them have elevated to The Question of <br/>\nEvil.  Because of that, they can get pretty goofy.  For instance, one way <br/>\nI&#39;ve heard the central tenet of Christianity paraphrased is that God so loved the <br/>\nworld that he committed divine child abuse .  Or in Hinduism, souls that are <br/>\nworking their way to enlightenment may choose incarnations (or be sentenced to <br/>\nincarnations) that seem awful, but all is as it is supposed to be.  And so <br/>\nthe mostly Hindu nation of India lives with the Untouchables.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(I should clarify that I think faith and religion are amazing things, because <br/>\nthey are an expression of the natural capacity for spirituality that lives in <br/>\nhumans.  It&#39;s just that they can be reduced to some statements that are <br/>\nreally weird, even harmful [to humans].) <br/>\n<br/>\nBut there may be more useful insights when one goes back to the <br/>\nevolutionarily stable way that humans lived for nearly three million years before the <br/>\nagricultural revolution.  Insights like: Take only what you need;  Limit your <br/>\npopulation size;  Live by the laws of your tribe, but don&#39;t assume you can tell <br/>\nother tribes how to live;  As you eat one day, you may be eaten on another, so <br/>\nyou might want to come to terms with death as a very real part of life.  (And <br/>\nworld religions and their practitioners often confuse death with evil, it <br/>\nseems.)  So in unschooling and in life, it might be useful to extend the models for <br/>\nmaking choices.  I&#39;m not saying that we will return to a hunter/gatherer <br/>\nlifestyle, but that we can learn and envision and create a way of life that is not <br/>\ninherently destructive to the planet or ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I have to laugh at myself, because I&#39;m just so pleased with <br/>\neverything I just wrote here that I&#39;m envisioning the responses:  &quot;wow, you&#39;ll have no <br/>\ntrouble with unschooling,&quot; and &quot;what was that book again?&quot;  Probably not, huh? <br/>\n But it is exciting for me as I&#39;m integrating these ideas into how I interact <br/>\nwith the world, and I&#39;m very interested in feedback and yes, criticism.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pressing send now.

The caution I have in myself now, <br/>\nthough, is to beleive that these ideas are axiomaticthat a <br/>\nbroken leg equals fear of the future and not wanting to move. If <br/>\nwe believe that it actually means those things, we will become <br/>\nperfectionists in our attempts to control our emotions, thoughts, <br/>\nbeliefs and ideas to prevent bad things from occuring, when in <br/>\nreality there isn&#39;t a belief system/healthy emotional life system on <br/>\nthe planet that protects anyone from harm or evil.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    The deeper reason for things happening might not always be <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; learn a lesson, it may be to keep something else from <br/>\n </span></blockquote>happening.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Let&#39;s say someone is planning a vacation, but got sick.
