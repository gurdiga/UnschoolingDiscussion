The cross-dressers, perhaps accompanied by<br/>\n   &quot;Muscle Marys&quot;, will appear on a float commemorating Australian cinema,<br/>\n   in this case the 1995 movie &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the<br/>\n   Desert&quot;, which features a band of transvestites trekking through the<br/>\n   Australian Outback. Local newspapers are supporting the plan, noting<br/>\n   that cross-dressing is &quot;a part of the nation&#39;s art culture.&quot; Closing<br/>\n   ceremony director Ric Birch dismissed the anti-gay protests, noting<br/>\n   &quot;This element of the show is only a tiny part of a huge celebration.<br/>\n   [As] for the right wing reactionaries, ...they&#39;re always going to be<br/>\n   outraged.&quot; Other floats in the closing ceremony parade will commemorate<br/>\n   other Australian movies, such as Crocodile Dundee and Mad Max.<br/>\n   (Reuters) ...Which will surely trigger protests by animal rights and<br/>\n   anti-violence advocates.<br/>\n<br/>\nOLYMPIC MEMORIES: The medal design for Sydney&#39;s winning athletes does not<br/>\n   depict a classic Greek stadium, but rather the Coliseum in Rome. While<br/>\n   Olympic officials deny that the stadium shown is the Coliseum, Wojciech<br/>\n   Pietranik, who designed the medals, admits the design is indeed based<br/>\n   on the Coliseum. He said he really wanted to depict &quot;Nike, the Goddess<br/>\n   of Victory, visiting Sydney,&quot; as represented by the city&#39;s famous Opera<br/>\n   House, but the International Olympic Committee vetoed that idea and<br/>\n   ordered the design reflect the 1928 medal by Italian sculptor Guiseppe<br/>\n   Cassioli, which was also based on the Coliseum. (Reuters) ...Of course<br/>\n   the IOC rejected Nike -- she was depicted as a Swoosh.<br/>\n<br/>\n       ----------==========**********O**********==========----------<br/>\n                    *FREE* *FREE* FREE INKJET CARTRIDGES<br/>\nBUY 1 GET 2 FREE ON ALL EPSON S020093 3 FOR $15.50 / S020089 3 FOR $24.00<br/>\n  /S020191 3 FOR $28 /S020187 3 FOR $19.50 /S020189 3 FOR $21 /MOST CANON<br/>\n  6000 3BK 3 FOR $17.99 / ALL COLORS 3 FOR $14.99 / BCI 21 3 COL 3 BLK FOR<br/>\n   $27.50/NEW LEXMARK LASERS 1382760 $92.99 140109A $131.99 1382150 $210<br/>\n        CLICK HERE for complete list of cartridges and information.<br/>\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.inkjetRus.net/true.html\">http://www.inkjetRus.net/true.html</a> 877-906-2884<br/>\n       ----------==========**********O**********==========----------<br/>\n<br/>\nOLYMPIC FEARS: Sydney Olympic officials scoff over worries that triathlon<br/>\n   competitors might be bitten by sharks during their swim in Sydney<br/>\n   harbor. &quot;There&#39;s more chance of a triathlete being hit by lightning or<br/>\n   stung by a bee than bitten by a shark,&quot; argues competition manager<br/>\n   David Hansen. But to keep athletes from being &quot;concerned&quot; over recent<br/>\n   sightings of sharks in the harbor, divers armed with electric shark<br/>\n   repellant systems have been hired to drive motorized scooters under the<br/>\n   swimmers to shoo away any pesky man-eaters. Experts say the divers will<br/>\n   feel an electrical &quot;tingle&quot;, but the athletes above them won&#39;t feel a<br/>\n   thing. (Reuters) ...Though if they do, they&#39;re likely to record their<br/>\n   best times ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nOLYMPIC EXPECTATIONS: Every athlete competing in the Sydney Olympics will<br/>\n   get an allotment of 51 condoms in their welcome package. Assuming they<br/>\n   stay all 17 days, that gives each three condoms per day.

If your other subscribers are like me<br/>\n   they&#39;ll never grow tired of it, and as long as there is an ample supply<br/>\n   of fools & madmen you&#39;ll never run out of material.&quot; I&#39;m indeed not<br/>\n   worried about running out of material. I&#39;ve never had a shortage of<br/>\n   things to write about, and I&#39;m enjoying doing it as much as ever.

I always wonder why anything &#39;Christian&#39; gets<br/>\n   blasted and not any other religion? Don&#39;t tell me that it&#39;s because<br/>\n   Christians are so narrow minded. I won&#39;t buy into that one.&quot; Bryant,<br/>\n   Christians, as a whole, aren&#39;t narrow-minded, so it must just be you.<br/>\n   It does blow me away when I write about one religion&#39;s dumb doings<br/>\n   (such as a recent article about Muslim men being counseled to beat<br/>\n   their women &quot;gently&quot;) and THAT&#39;s &quot;funny&quot; to fundamental Christians, but<br/>\n   when I write another article about Christians doing something stupid,<br/>\n   suddenly you forget about those earlier stories and accuse me of being<br/>\n   &quot;anti-Christian&quot;. Of course I&#39;m not &quot;anti-Christian&quot;, Bryant, I&#39;m anti-<br/>\n   idiot and anti-hypocrite. If that bothers you, it only makes me wonder<br/>\n   which one of those YOU are.

If you aren&#39;t<br/>\n   familiar with The Onion, it&#39;s a parody newspaper which runs both online<br/>\n   and in print, so it&#39;s a bit ironic that people are taking it seriously.<br/>\n   Of course, the people getting hysterical about it aren&#39;t spending any<br/>\n   time *thinking* about the issue, or *reviewing* the source &quot;evidence&quot;.<br/>\n   Just like most hoaxes online, eh?)<br/>\n<br/>\n       ----------==========**********O**********==========----------<br/>\n                      *** WIN A TRIP TO AUSTRALIA ***<br/>\n         Send your friends and family a ZingCard today for a chance<br/>\n           to win a trip to Australia.
