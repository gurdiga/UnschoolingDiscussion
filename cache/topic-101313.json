I got &quot;reducing pressure from others to go to<br/>\ncollege right now, by having alternative information&quot; as the intent. Here&#39;s<br/>\nthe quote:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I&#39;d like to give my daughter some information about careers that do not<br/>\nrequire a college degree so she can understand that she has options other<br/>\nthan college, and I was hoping some members on this list could suggest a few<br/>\nresources.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is to have the information and confidence to choose or reject<br/>\ncollege mindfully. The mainstream path is that college is essential for<br/>\nprosperity, and possibly even a guarantee of same. We have examples to show<br/>\nthat neither proposition is always true. The mainstream thinking is that<br/>\nmerely completing any college degree is an indicator of certain personal and<br/>\nethical qualities in a person such as perseverance, application, and<br/>\nseriousness regarding work. Well I guess we have examples to show that is<br/>\nalso sometimes balderdash, and that there are other ways of demonstrating<br/>\nthese attributes. <br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH going to college for a vocational or personal interest reason that is<br/>\nimportant to the student, can make it a wonderful experience. Sometimes<br/>\nthere are facilities and tools that are available to the student that would<br/>\nbe harder to find elsewhere. Sometimes the peer group of like minded and<br/>\npassionate individuals in the field makes the experience brilliant. I found<br/>\nboth of these facets of college when I went into an area I was passionate<br/>\nabout at the &quot;mature age&quot; (the official designation) of 26, with a very<br/>\nclear idea of my interests and my educational goals for the course of study<br/>\nI chose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI returned to college because I felt a lack of knowledge and skills in<br/>\nmyself, that was holding me back in my career. I found the pace of learning<br/>\non the job to be too slow for my own advancement. I had a great time<br/>\nsocially also, but that was not the motivation behind attendance.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I wrote about my own college history a while ago:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I do remember feeling a strong need for education in my mid twenties. I<br/>\nfelt I needed more skills if I wanted to advance as a set/costume designer.<br/>\nSo I went to Technical College specifically for that. First I studied some<br/>\nArchitectural Drafting (in the olden days before CAD)at one place; then I<br/>\ndid some Fashion Illustration and also Pattern Drafting at two others – just<br/>\nenough for practical purposes. Finally after working for a while, both in<br/>\nand out of the theater, I returned to University and actually attained a<br/>\ndegree in Theatre Design, discovering both Lighting Design (which I truly<br/>\nadore) and Film. The feeling of going to college for my own genuine purposes<br/>\nand really loving it, was so immensely different from going when I first<br/>\nfinished High School, and enrolling in an unfinished Bachelor of Science,<br/>\nbecause I felt so pressured by everyone as top of the class to “do something<br/>\nwith my brain”, when all I really wanted was Show Business. (I should add<br/>\neveryone except my mother, ironically, who much preferred that I go into the<br/>\n“family business”- musical theater.) Now I am very excited to be writing<br/>\nfeature film scripts.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFact is, I could have continued to work in the theater without the degree,<br/>\nin different positions, but I was ambitious and wanted to be in charge of my<br/>\ndepartment(s) sooner. Being motivated and somewhat talented did not make it<br/>\na &quot;trivial&quot; enterprise, either. It was actually wonderfully challenging.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we can add to the list many positions in all the Performing Arts as<br/>\nplaces for employment without a college degree. I don&#39;t think I have ever<br/>\nasked a single person for their college qualifications when interviewing<br/>\nthem for either a theater or film job. You don&#39;t need a degree to write<br/>\neither, although sometimes access to the helpful criticism of the Professors<br/>\ncan be useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

You see, I was one who had &quot;fallen between the cracks&quot;.  <br/>\nIronically, it was inside one of the most regulated institutions in <br/>\nthe country and, still, there I was, between the cracks.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring high school I regularly failed my classes only to pass by <br/>\nacing the exams.  I hardly even went to school.  I missed 42 days in <br/>\none semester.  Then I failed my senior year, took two classes in <br/>\nsummer school, failed one of them and had to return to earn my <br/>\ndiploma.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I registered for my summer school classes after my senior year, <br/>\nmy guidance counselor asked me if I &quot;did drugs&quot;.  I didn&#39;t.  Nor did <br/>\nI drink, smoke, swear or hang out.  I had no police record.  He was <br/>\nbaffled as to why I had failed and so was I.  Now I know that I was <br/>\njust &quot;between the cracks&quot; where they couldn&#39;t reach.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI knew lots of others from school who had also fallen there.  Some of <br/>\nthem got into trouble, some dropped out and others just drifted from <br/>\nview.  We were all there between the cracks for many reasons.  Some, <br/>\nlike me, were just bored and didn&#39;t care about school.  Others lived <br/>\nthe horrors of abuse and had no room left in their lives for school.  <br/>\nMany just found other outlets for their time and energy; drugs, <br/>\nmusic, employment, motherhood, travel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d have a difficult time trying to figure out what to say to anyone <br/>\nwho would actually recognize me if I went back.  You see, I am <br/>\nstill &quot;between the cracks&quot;.   My life has not been a success in their <br/>\nterms.  I have no college degree, no career and precious little <br/>\nmoney.  I don&#39;t own my own house or even a car.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do, however, have a marriage of over 20 years, four beautiful <br/>\nunschooled children (who have been raised right here, between the <br/>\ncracks).  I&#39;ve spent countless hours volunteering, founded several <br/>\norganizations and owned three successful businesses. I&#39;ve grown my <br/>\nown food including raising and slaughtering poultry.  I can spin <br/>\nwool, weave and sew my own clothes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned how to play the piano, interpret for the Deaf, and train <br/>\ndogs.  I have been interviewed for radio, television and print.  I <br/>\nwas the subject of a cover story for a large urban weekly.   I have <br/>\ndirected Shakespeare and developed a love for the opera.  I performed <br/>\nin my first professional theatre production at the age of 38 and <br/>\nregularly work as a volunteer costumer.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople I don&#39;t know contact me for advice and information on a daily <br/>\nbasis.  I&#39;m asked to speak to groups that range from political to <br/>\neducational to religious. I&#39;ve sat on the boards of charitable <br/>\norganizations and was a member of the American Library Association.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy writings have been published in small specialty magazines and <br/>\nlarge international publications.  I developed an innovative foreign <br/>\nlanguage curriculum for children and was once teaching (very <br/>\neffectively) over 100 students foreign languages I don&#39;t even speak.  <br/>\nI was the January 1997 Daily Didactic Diversion winner at cartalk.com <br/>\nbut never made it to Politically Incorrect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve hosted award winning, internationally renowned authors and <br/>\nrecently dined with the mayor of Houston, Texas and a U.S. <br/>\nRepresentative. I served a Congressional internship before <br/>\ncongressional internships were considered risky (or is that risqué?) <br/>\nand I have won two local elections; one as a Democrat and one as a <br/>\nRepublican but I belong to neither party now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not bragging, mind you.
