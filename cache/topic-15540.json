It seems that from all the strong voices I see in <br/>\nthese posts...everyone here on this list also feel strongly about what brings <br/>\nthem to thier choices.  Being a single parent and having to have a full time <br/>\njob...they spend enough time away from me as it is...I don&#39;t want to send <br/>\nthem to PS for another 8 hours.  I also feel that the ps system is breaking <br/>\ndown...to many parents trust that system to take care of their kids and <br/>\nteachers are not paid enough to go thru what they have to with on a daily <br/>\nbasis in ps classrooms...So I am jealous of thier time away from me, I don&#39;t <br/>\ntrust the environment provided in ps&#39;s, I don&#39;t trust a culture where their <br/>\nrole models are not adults but other kids...I don&#39;t like the whole-gotta be <br/>\npopular or fit into a group mentality that ps breeds in the kids...I really <br/>\nbelieve that their education is my responsibility...and I feel I know more <br/>\nabout who they are now than I did before I took them out of ps...I can go on <br/>\nand on...for us we are living a wonderful adventure filled life that I don&#39;t <br/>\nallow the ills of society to intrude.  They will have plenty of time to deal <br/>\nwith those ills when they grow up...now is my time with them...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Question 2...<br/>\n90% of my discipline is what I call...on the wall...when they get out of <br/>\nline...(and this is anywhere we happen to be when they get out of <br/>\nline)...they have to stand on the wall...sort of like in a corner...but they <br/>\nhave to keep their hands raised above thier heads...sort of like time-out in <br/>\nthat they are only &#39;on the wall&#39; for the minutes that equal their number of <br/>\nyears...once they have spent a minute or so on the wall...I start talking to <br/>\nthem about what put them on the wall...and they usually end up off the wall <br/>\nas soon as they have verbalized why they ended up there and how they can stay <br/>\n&#39;off the wall&#39;...my sister always trys to say...You have to be on the wall <br/>\nfor 30 minutes and she doesn&#39;t talk to them...so they end up uncomfortable <br/>\nfor that long and it is more like punishment...I don&#39;t put a time on it...I <br/>\ndepend on more if they can learn how to keep off the wall...if they need <br/>\nquiet time...I give them an activity to do...if they are really grumpy and <br/>\nhave a hard time getting along...then we all take a break...maybe take a <br/>\nnap...read a book...usually something relaxing...maybe watch some tv...if <br/>\nthey are rowdy...then we leave the house...they probably have cabin fever...I <br/>\nhave rules and expectations...they get fired if they blow off their chores <br/>\nand have to earn thier allowance back...etc etc...it works for us...there is <br/>\nalot of respect between the three of us...I have no problems telling them <br/>\nwhat I need from them and they have no problems helping me out...<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion 4<br/>\nWe sought out 4H...and one of my best friends...Carrie...also homeschools her <br/>\nthree kids and was homeschooled...so she is a great support...I am hoping <br/>\nthat as we travel the US...we will get to meet many different hs&#39;ers and <br/>\nuns&#39;ers...and I am working on getting involved with church...that is the <br/>\nhardest cuz I am very eclectic in my spirituality...Christians only want to <br/>\nknow about my experience with Jesus and pagans only want to know what <br/>\nmagickal tradition I follow...I feel that all paths have something important <br/>\nto teach and I don&#39;t want to be closed to any particular one...<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t speak for anyone else...but my goals is to teach my kids that as a <br/>\nfamily...we are a team...and we are connected...I hope that they will move <br/>\ninto adulthood with a sense that they have a responsibility to help our world <br/>\nchange and grow...and mostly I want us to have fun and a zest for life...it <br/>\nseems that too many kids are unhappy with their lot...I hope that our family <br/>\nstructure keeps unhappiness at bay...<br/>\n<br/>\nLhiza, Scotti (10) and Kevyn (8)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15529,"nextTopicId":15481}}
