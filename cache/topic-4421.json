They will<br/>\narmour themselves emotionally and toughen themselves in a way which detracts<br/>\nfrom the kind of openness I personally want to foster in my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children will and have inevitably been exposed to the violence and genuine<br/>\nhorror in the world.  They are initially horrified.  They adapt.  I am glad it<br/>\nhappened in a way which was modulated by our intervention.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur six year old daughter watched Bambi for the first time with no ill<br/>\neffects.  Her older sister would have not been ready at six. We won&#39;t let her<br/>\nwatch Star Wars which her 10 year old sister just watched.  We screened the<br/>\nStar Wars trilogy for the older when little sister was doing something else.<br/>\nLittle sister thought it terribly unfair but this is understandable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is a possible confusion to equate the oppressive practices of your<br/>\nparents with protecting children from unnecessary exposure to horror, gore,<br/>\npromiscuous sexuality, violence whether it be physical or psychological.<br/>\n<br/>\nDocumentaries can be every bit if not more disturbing and damaging to children<br/>\nas fiction.  Roots is full of adult/older child themes and scenes.  The news is<br/>\nunsuitable for very young children.  They will deal with all of those issues<br/>\nwhen they are ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe cannot &quot;protect&quot; our children from all that is harsh and negative and<br/>\nhorrifying even if we set out to do that.  This does not mean that we should<br/>\nnot try to protect them from those things that we can.  Protecting does not<br/>\nmean saying &quot;Don&#39;t do that.  Its very bad and dangerous.&quot;  It is much more<br/>\ncomplicated and involves really communicating with children not handing down<br/>\nedicts from on high.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur children protest when they can&#39;t watch something that we want to watch but<br/>\nis not appropriate for them (doesn&#39;t happen often) but that is okay.  We are a<br/>\ndemocracy but as parents hold a number of vetoes which the children do not<br/>\nhave. We use them with discretion, respect and restraint.
