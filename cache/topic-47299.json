But human beings are self-centered enough <br/>\nby nature that it will not happen that way.

Though by no means perfect, it <br/>\nat least gave the leadership to the more experienced people: the <br/>\nadults.  Within adulthood, it gave leadership to the experienced <br/>\nelderly.  Along parallel lines, societies used to award respect to <br/>\nthose in authority (mayors, judges, police officers, professionals in <br/>\ntheir field such as doctors, lawyers, used car salesmen (well, you <br/>\nget the idea), governors, and presidents.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we now raise children to ignore those hierarchies, but we do not <br/>\ncome up with better ones to replace them, we are leaving our society <br/>\nopen to anarchy (I suppose that means no one respects anyone else in <br/>\ncase of a tie or disagreement).
