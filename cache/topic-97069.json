Thanks for the challenge to higher standards of critical thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth:  Thanks for your interesting points about scientific inquiry, and the insightful suggestion that inspiration and discovery can come from discussions (like cleaning metals!) that are not &quot;completely rational, linear and clear&quot;.  Well put!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m new to this group (& to homeschooling!), but have thoroughly enjoyed following &quot;threads&quot; of the past week&#39;s discussions.   Been itching to jump in with my two bits on Santa, vaccines, etc.   Sorry, I don&#39;t have much to add re: Coke!    Had no idea anyone might consider Coke to be corrosive to the stomach, but wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a doctor advised people with ulcers to stay off it!   Our family&#39;s always avoided it due to  1) overload of sugar  2) caffeine  3) carbonation  4) artificial color  5) aluminum & plastic clogging up landfills, but mostly because ~ 6) we like water best   :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 20        <br/>\n   Date: Sun, 25 Jul 2004 11:35:30 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n   From: Elizabeth Roberts &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ladyeliza_r@...\">ladyeliza_r@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: cleaning metals in unusual ways<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what is unscientific about hearing an idea and<br/>\ntesting it out for yourself, or asking someone if they<br/>\nhave and what happened, let alone with piping up about<br/>\nsomething in a similar vein of thought, re: Coke<br/>\ncleans this metal and toothpaste can another?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry your thread was hijacked, but conversations can<br/>\ntake on many tangents. That doesn&#39;t make it any less<br/>\ninformative or interesting for those interested in<br/>\nfollowing that tangent. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs it is, yes, we should be fostering our children&#39;s<br/>\ncuriosity and helping them to think it through<br/>\nclearly. But not all of us have that ability<br/>\nourselves, so bouncing ideas off other adults before<br/>\nwe bring it up to our children or our children bring<br/>\nit up with us is a fully rational thing to do. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It was an expression of my frustration that people<br/>\nwill make public recommendations about things without<br/>\nreally looking at what they&#39;re saying.&quot; (Sandra)<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah. That can be frustrating. Not everyone thinks<br/>\nbefore they speak, but just because it&#39;s not an idea<br/>\nthat grabs you doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not valid. It<br/>\nmay be off the wall, and it may not even be right (and<br/>\nthe person might not be aware of that, but I doubt<br/>\ntheir intention was not to throw out disinformation);<br/>\nbut it may also bring out something else that IS right<br/>\nand IS valid - and something that inspires someone<br/>\nelse&#39;s curiosity and thinking to find out more about<br/>\nit. The process isn&#39;t necessarily everything, nor is<br/>\nthe end. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow many inventions have come about because someone<br/>\nwas thinking one thing, wanting something to happen a<br/>\ncertain way, and something else happened instead? <br/>\n<br/>\nScientific thought isn&#39;t necessarily completely<br/>\nrational linear and clear. <br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 7/25/04 10:26:35 AM,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pyxiewytch@...\">pyxiewytch@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; I know from experience that toothpaste is great<br/>\n&gt; for polishing silver... &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any toothpaste?
