My family&#39;s life tends to be very hectic and so if I think of <br/>\nsomething or find something or buy something or somehow acquire something <br/>\nthat I think one of the kids might enjoy, it is better for me to put it out <br/>\nin their path - rather than try to remember to tell them about it.

So I put the flier <br/>\non the refrigerator door. I forgot about it - but Roxana saw it there and <br/>\ncame to me with her eyes glowing and totally thrilled about going. (We did go <br/>\n- last week - and Ray Bradbury was one of the best speakers I&#39;ve ever seen - <br/>\nhe was SO inspiring and unschoolish - talked a LOT about following your <br/>\npassions, not believing that what they teach you in school is what is <br/>\nnecessarily &quot;important&quot; or &quot;significant&quot; for you and how you&#39;re responsible <br/>\nfor your own education, etc. Plus - we won the door prize, which was a huge <br/>\nbasket of Trader Joe&#39;s stuff.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - that&#39;s typical &quot;strewing&quot; in my household.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh - another example was when we were thinking about buying a car, I left <br/>\nbrochures about the car I wanted on the table for my dh to find.

Given a choice, I try to make the more <br/>\nintellectually stimulating path.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat concept, too, is from an SCA context.  I saw Sir Leif Ivarsson this <br/>\nweekend.  When he was to be knighted in 1987, the year Kirby was a baby, I <br/>\nwent to his vigil the night before.   My husband and I had wanted to knight <br/>\nhim, when we were king and queen a few months before that, but he hadn&#39;t been <br/>\na member and so we couldn&#39;t do it.  I was in there discussing that with him, <br/>\nthe kind of improved awareness he would be expected to exhibit as a knight <br/>\nand the example he needed to set.  He said he was ashamed that his camp <br/>\nwasn&#39;t really period and spiffy and he couldn&#39;t afford all period stuff.  I <br/>\ntold him ours all came gradually.  And if he could only afford a nylon tent, <br/>\nif his choice was orange or brown take brown.  And when his choice was nylon <br/>\nor canvas, take canvas.  And when is was store-bought or handmade, take <br/>\nhandmade.  &quot;Always make the more medieval choice,&quot; I said, and I was so <br/>\nexcited by this concept that I went back to my camp and told my own household <br/>\nabout it.  They were excited too.  It was kind of elegant and a good basis <br/>\nfor decision making.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne month later it bit me in the butt.  We were at an event up in the <br/>\nmountains from Colorado Springs, and since I had the baby my husband had done <br/>\nall the food preparation for our group.  I asked for a Dr Pepper (for my mug, <br/>\nnot to drink from the can, of course! &lt;g&gt;), and he said &quot;I brought juice <br/>\ninstead of soda, because you said always make the more medieval choice.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the concept of incrementally approaching a goal has stuck with me all of <br/>\nKirby&#39;s life. You can&#39;t go from nothing to everything in one step, but you <br/>\ncan step toward the goal instead of away in one step.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] A Rich Environment","postDate":"1022511908","msgId":37513,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlhLjI2MTI3MDNhLjJhMjNhNTI0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":37511,"nextInTopic":37515,"prevInTime":37512,"nextInTime":37514,"topicId":37463,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/26/02 8:55:33 PM, freeform@juno.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1922858713\">In a message dated 5/26/02 8:55:33 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freeform@...\">freeform@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; So, what&#39;s the difference between strewing things and simply having a lot<br/>\nof cool stuff around, in your mind?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRearrange the cool stuff from time to time.

But if we actually look at the situation what we may<br/>\nsee is a child who&#39;s living someone else&#39;s idea of what life is supposed to<br/>\nbe like a puppet.

My daughter is rather neutral ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do *your* kids like? One way that curriculum fills us with so much<br/>\nanxiety is that it feels like someone has chosen the best, most effective<br/>\nroute somewhere and if our kids shrug with disinterest, then if feels like<br/>\nthey won&#39;t be getting &quot;there&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo concentrate on the journey rather where they &quot;should&quot; be going. :-) Find<br/>\nways of helping them get the most out of their right now lives. They&#39;re 6<br/>\nand 8 and 13 and every age for a reason. They need to be good at those ages<br/>\nrather than working on adulthood preparation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What one or several books would you recommend every unschooling home<br/>\n&gt; have?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The internet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI loved the Chinaberry catalog (http://www.chinaberry.com) when my daughter<br/>\nwas younger.

It does feel manipulative to me, like placing things on<br/>\na child&#39;s path and hoping that she&#39;ll &quot;discover&quot; them.

She&#39;s pulled out lots of things<br/>\nthat I&#39;d forgotten we even owned.

That<br/>\nwould feel manipulative to me - that&#39;s her bedside shelf, stacked with<br/>\nher books that she&#39;s decided she may want to read at night. <br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I did stick &quot;It&#39;s a Girl Thing&quot; (great book about puberty and<br/>\ndeveloment and all that) next to her bed, but she was there when I did<br/>\nit... I thought she might feel more comfortable reading it if the book<br/>\nwas already there...she freaks out when I say &quot;underwear&quot; aloud at<br/>\nTarget, so it just seemed better to have the book there waiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; daughter will <br/>\n&gt; find interest in things that I show interest in, but is it like <br/>\n&gt; pretending to <br/>\n&gt; like sports to try to hang out with the hubby?

She left some curriculum catalogs at my home to peruse. <br/>\nOut of curiosity, I have made it halfway through the Sonlight catalog. <br/>\n(sidenote: it was overwhelming, especially the preschool curriculum for 3-4 <br/>\nyears olds, I have an almost 3yo and I can&#39;t imagine what these folks are <br/>\nthinking.

(Any <br/>\ninput on the Moore Formula would be appreciated also, I identify with some of <br/>\ntheir theories, but not sure how it would mesh with unschooling) I shared <br/>\nwith her that I bought the &quot;everything your 4th grader needs to know&quot; as a <br/>\njumping point when we first stopped public school. At first I felt a need to <br/>\nsplit it up and try to explore a certain amount daily, to &quot;cover our butts&quot;, <br/>\nbut quickly learned how boring and tedious that would be. I now keep it as a <br/>\nreference, and a take along book in case we are somewhere and my dd wants to <br/>\nread and explore in it. It&#39;s got some interesting stuff in it. It came in <br/>\nhandy when we were playing with roman numerals and secret coding on a road <br/>\ntrip. Browsing through this catalog, I started wondering if I would like to <br/>\npurchase/borrow any of these resources. I saw a sample of the &quot;schedule&quot; and <br/>\nI almost broke out in hives.
