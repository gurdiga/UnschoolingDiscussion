By the following weekend, the tree is decorated, and it&#39;s <br/>\nofficially the holiday season in our house!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter my neices and nephews were born, we decided as an extended family that <br/>\nadult siblings would no longer exchange presents.  [I can&#39;t tell you how much <br/>\nstress that relieved!]  We all give to our nieces and nephews and to our <br/>\nparents and children.  We make a lot of our presents.  I usually crochet <br/>\nsomething for my mother-in-law and mother.  We usually buy for the nieces and <br/>\nnephews, but each year our kids make gifts to give their relatives.  One year <br/>\nwe tie-dyed socks for everybody.  Last year we made &quot;hand&quot; soap using a tiny <br/>\nWilton cake pan in the shape of a hand.  I crocheted simple bath puppets to <br/>\nput the &quot;hand&quot; soap in.  This year we&#39;re thinking about decorating picture <br/>\nframes.  For the last several years, I have also either crocheted or <br/>\ncross-stitched an angel ornament for each family&#39;s tree.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe usually get together with my husband&#39;s family on Christmas Eve.  Then on <br/>\nXmas Day we would open Santa presents, then we&#39;d go to Gary&#39;s aunt&#39;s house <br/>\nfor lunch with all the family.  Last year for several reasons the aunt <br/>\ndecided not to have everyone for lunch.  Although it was the end of a <br/>\ntradition that my husband expected would last forever, it was really nice not <br/>\nto have to leave the house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen sometime around Jan. 1, the tree -- by that time more than a month cut <br/>\n-- is beginning to show its age, so we lovingly dismantle it and it goes on <br/>\nto its new life as recycled wood.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe temperature will hit 53 here in Dallas tonight.  It&#39;s beginning to feel a <br/>\nlot like Christmas. . . . . . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nCarron</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Valerie","from":"&quot;Valerie&quot; &lt;valeries@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ImhkFlrIy0CAPHs9XbioB1LrnaqfwCwIESkDQMEGUXarGVfzqTFYwPcjeSf2J9YZ6o0bV8Om_VMC2UWmnvWmZb09tPfEQg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] christmas","postDate":"969838505","msgId":13366,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDIwMWMwMjY4MCQxMTdmNTIwMCRjNzhlM2VhNkB3dnVzLm9yZz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDhxbGlrMytpMG1kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13363,"nextInTopic":13368,"prevInTime":13365,"nextInTime":13367,"topicId":13354,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Would some one like to tell me what an American Christmas is like?

That way we feel like we have a<br/>\nreal beginning and ending to our holiday. Lots of music, baking, gift-giving<br/>\nthe whole time.<br/>\nIn my family, Christmas was Dec24th (Scandinavian). My husband&#39;s family<br/>\ncelebrated only on the 25th. So that really worked out when we got married.<br/>\nIt&#39;s non-stop Christmas from the afternoon of the 24th till all the kids<br/>\nfall asleep on the 25th.<br/>\nOur church also celebrates Advent, St Lucia&#39;s Day, Christmas Eve, and<br/>\nEpiphany, so there&#39;s lots of celebrations going on.<br/>\nWhat is it like there?<br/>\n<br/>\n---Valerie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Cbh3LrNS7akCEALQyrj289TBGA8TFWHZxEorlDf8ktQl-omwz-OQHk_pFP4KyaZPHMJ3CwpuExKppEHG1_tmRl-Vag","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] christmas","postDate":"969834358","msgId":13363,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwOTI0MjI1My5lOE9Nck44MzAxNTZAc20wMTAxLnByb21lZGlhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":13355,"nextInTopic":13366,"prevInTime":13362,"nextInTime":13364,"topicId":13354,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We have as many different kinds here as we do folks who have immigrated here and as there are different religions.
