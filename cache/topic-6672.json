 but that they have found that emotion is a component, that<br/>\na good attitude tends to minimize the flares - the stress factor - the better you<br/>\ncan process and release stress the fewer symptoms you will experience.   beyond<br/>\nthat they are really at a loss as to the cause as well as a &#39;cure&#39;.  what they<br/>\ntold me to do was to go home take a few meds, and advised me to enjoy my family<br/>\nand to try to wean off the meds asap because of the side effects of long term<br/>\nuse.  though there are lots of theories based on patterns seen in patients,<br/>\ntreatment to date has been based on symptoms and trying to make the person as<br/>\ncomfortable as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nin my case, simply stated, the disease appears to have developed over a period of<br/>\ntime as a reaction to the mmr vaccine i was give at the age of 29 (they think i<br/>\nwas over vaccinated),  but according to the vedic dr i saw (on the advise of my<br/>\nadmitting  allopathic dr at the hospital at onset) autoimmune disease is<br/>\nbasically a problem with digestion, both literal and figurative (the digestion<br/>\nsystem is now believed by some to be a major component of the immune system).<br/>\nwhen food (or experiences) is not properly digested, it creates toxins and these<br/>\ntoxins then accumulate in the joints - rheumatoid arthritis, the connective<br/>\ntissues or systemically - lupus, the myelin surrounding the nerves - ms etc.<br/>\nwhen the body tries to rid itself of these toxin it also rids the body of the<br/>\ntissue the toxins have accumulated in.<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;ve read, in a study of people with rheumatoid arthritis, that100% of those<br/>\nstudied (the exact # in the study escapes me) were found to have toxic intestinal<br/>\nlinings making digestion and absortion nearly impossible which creates more<br/>\ntoxins and then the disease continues to progress.  this in combination with the<br/>\nside effects of the meds (e.g. destruction of cartilage & bone  by the steroids)<br/>\ncreates more and more difficulties.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe vedic perspective links the mind and the body (much like einstein linked time<br/>\nand space) so their approach is to eliminate toxins, but these toxins can be<br/>\ncreated through the mind (experiences) leading to a disruption in the physiology<br/>\n(poor digestion of food).   this is were the abusive childhood plays in.  the<br/>\nvedics see that we digest experiences much like we digest food.  if we experience<br/>\nsomething we find overwhelming then we store what we can&#39;t process which creates<br/>\nstress which in turn creates toxins then we find ourselves with difficulties of<br/>\nall sorts - not just autoimmune but allergies as well as others maladies.  the<br/>\nvedics also hold similar perspectives as the buddist and see karma and past lives<br/>\nas additional contributing factors.<br/>\n<br/>\nregardless of the perspective there seems to be a consensus that something in the<br/>\nbrain - a switch of sorts - seems to be stuck in the on position and until this<br/>\nswitch moves freely in response to a genuine need the symptoms will continue.<br/>\nfor some of us this comes in the form of unconditional love, which was not<br/>\nexperienced in childhood,  and for others like your daughter other factors are at<br/>\nissue.  perhaps one of the reasons autoimmune diseases prove to be such a<br/>\nmystery, especially for allopathic dr, is because there are so many variables,<br/>\nthat generalization just don&#39;t hold water, making it impossible to have one fixed<br/>\napproach - identify & name the disease then treat with standard protocol.<br/>\n<br/>\nagain i want you to know i am so sorry, i was being completely thoughtless in my<br/>\ncomments. having a sick child is so difficult, when i put myself is your place my<br/>\ncondition/situation pales.  thank you for pointing out my insensitivity and<br/>\nnarrow minded comment and please know it was not my intent to make such a<br/>\ngeneralization but was given simply as support and acknowledgement of one portion<br/>\nof reality not the whole picture.<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin,tx<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCampbell & Wyman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;

And these parents are , from what we have seen, loving and<br/>\nsupporting and caring parents as well. <br/>\nParents of children with auto-immune disorders live with constant stress.<br/>\nWe worry about what our sick children eat, and how they sleep, and how to<br/>\nmanage their chronic pain, and how to manage their many medications and<br/>\ntreatments, and how to support the family during emotionally stressful<br/>\ntimes, and how to just carry on from one day to the next.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to write this note in support of any other parents who are on this<br/>\nlist and are dealing with similar issues with sick children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are terrible abuses inflicted on some children...and certainly<br/>\nif children with auto-immune disorders had to deal with that abuse it would<br/>\nexacerbate their conditions. But please do not  suggest that abused and<br/>\nneglected children get auto-immune disorders. It is a sweeping<br/>\ngeneralization that does not deserve much merit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrooke<br/>\nP.S. I agree with your earlier post, Susan, that stated that dealing with<br/>\nthese issues makes one a deeper and richer person with a profoundly<br/>\nempathetic heart. Our daughter has certainly exhibited this on many<br/>\noccasions. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;michele clausen wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: michele clausen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:madklausen@...\">madklausen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hi, I too have an auto-immune disease ( Rheumatoid Arthritis) which I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>firmly<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; believe is caused my the emotional neglect and abuse I suffered as a child.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Michele.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; NZ.

I&#39;m so very very sorry.  I miscarried at 13 weeks about 1-1/2 <br/>\nyears ago.  It was probably related to my immune system.

To calm <br/>\nmy immune system down I have done several rounds of chemotherapy.  During <br/>\npregnancy I took a baby aspirin each day, at my doctor&#39;s suggestion.  This <br/>\nhelps a lot.

My mother","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-597151808\">When I was a child my aunt, who was my mom&#39;s best friend and lived with us for a while, had lupus.  She passed away when she was 24 and I was 10.  My mother has always had health problems, which they&#39;re still not positive what it is.  Fibromaylsia ,sp?&gt; I think is what they&#39;ve decided.  When my aunt lived with us I would get up with her a 5 am to help her do her hair for work.  On her days off we would tiptoe around the house so she could sleep until noon.  When her hair fell out I went to help her pick out a wig.  I was devastated when she died.  I have always helped my mother with housework and taking care of my brother.  To be perfectly honest, I do have to say that I feel that my mother depended too much on me (my dad left when I was 6) and was too hard on me (C&#39;s on my report card was not acceptable no matter what).  But, I think that was because of her circumstances and not really illness related.  I loved helping my aunt and never thought anything about it.  After all I feel that we are on this earth to help each other.  I think it has helped me to be more sensitive to others and also more intutive.  And it a way it has been a blessing in my life.  So I&#39;ve grown to be unmateralistic and I think I cherish life perhaps a bit more then I would have without the experience.  That which does not kill you should make you stronger.  And I think that life&#39;s pain and difficulties are lessons that we need to learn from in order to become more well rounded people.  Also, to let you know I have never been embarrassed by my mom or aunt even though we have plenty of stories that we look back and laugh about now.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Free voicemail and email, by phone or Web!

was not really talking yet and i was so overwhelmed - kind of like<br/>\nbeing stuck in an undertow and not knowing which end is up- he&#39;s emotional needs<br/>\nkind of got lost in the mayhem.  it was about 2 months after the onset and<br/>\nthings started to quiet down, when it dawned on me that i hadn&#39;t talked to him<br/>\nabout what was happening- he had been very distant and would not look at me,<br/>\nespecially in the hospital, which he hated.   when i came home (he and i had<br/>\nrarely spent anytime apart, no babysitters - mostly because we had no $ or<br/>\nfriends or family in the area) he stood on the porch laughed and laughed when he<br/>\nsaw me get out of the car.  i really think he thought i had moved out and into<br/>\nthe hospital and he was very angry i had left him.  at this time he had the<br/>\nworst diaper rash ever.  i think it was because he was so stressed and he is<br/>\nvery stoic by nature that he toughed it out causing his body to get very very<br/>\nacidic.<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway, we revisit this time periodically.  especially when i go some place to<br/>\nhave treatment. i&#39;ve done this twice - once to the chopra center in san diego<br/>\nfor 10 days and the 2nd to dallas maharishi ayurvedic center for 3 weeks.  both<br/>\ntimes were very hard on him.  he hangs in there and is fine or appears fine but<br/>\nafter a few days some minor incident crushes him and he inevitably get sick and<br/>\nstays sick until i return.  it&#39;s very sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nrecently, about 2 1/2 years after onset, we were talking about horses and i was<br/>\ntelling him about the horses we had when i was a kid.  he asked me if he was<br/>\ngoing to meet them and i said no because they were dead - well he broke down and<br/>\ncried and cried, which is very unusual for him.  we talked about it and i asked<br/>\nhim if part of the reason he was so upset about the horses dying was because of<br/>\nme being sick and he said &#39; i thought you were going to die&#39;.  it was so sad but<br/>\nalso very good that we  found a way to release some of this stress that had been<br/>\nburdening him.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe wonderful thing about this situation for him (for me is a whole other<br/>\nstory:) is that he has developed compassion, flexibility,  independence, a<br/>\ndeeper ability to cooperate and think of others,  as well as a good<br/>\nunderstanding of the human body - before he was 4 he knew the different body<br/>\nsystems and the name of the organs, their basic functions and where they<br/>\nbelonged in the body.  i&#39;ve spent a lot of time and energy feeling very guilty<br/>\nfor not being able to do things with him, for relying so heavily on tv to make<br/>\nit through the day, for not being able to drive a car (because of the severe<br/>\nlost of muscle in my shoulder i get fatigued just by sitting up) etc. but now i<br/>\nhave accepted it as a wonderful gift rather than seeing as a burden and<br/>\nsomething that ruined rene&#39;s chances at  having a happy childhood.  we learn<br/>\nthings in so many diverse ways who&#39;s to really say what is the best way to<br/>\nlearn.<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin,tx<br/>\ndessert first<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. i do have a question for others with autoimmune diseases. last monday i<br/>\nmiscarried at 11 weeks because of this and i was wondering if any of you had<br/>\nsimilar problem. if so what have you done to calm your immune system down?</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"D Klement","from":"D Klement &lt;klement@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"MJ3iu_IpGt3HmFZsh7lo9U0AoxmTTt-yAd08GvHLd91Aog8xMNIWzP_tHg-lvwkpc_V43MNCAHrU-kk9zx9Sj3euzbmukyLx","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Illness","postDate":"950980757","msgId":6681,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40MjcuNjY4MS45NTkyNjk3NDZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6680,"nextInTopic":6683,"prevInTime":6680,"nextInTime":6682,"topicId":6672,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They will often ask to help, and they take very<br/>\ngood care of me!!!!<br/>\nThey would rather not go somewhere exciting if they thought the driving there<br/>\nwould make me sore, in fact Anna was in tears one time with worry for me!<br/>\nSometimes I wonder though if that is just too much for a six year old and I<br/>\nreally worry sometimes if that will cause some sort of negative outcome in my<br/>\ndaughters lives. On the other hand the girls are filled with compassion for<br/>\neveryone that is hurting and they seem to have developed without the typical<br/>\negocentric behaviour I see in kids their own age. (mostly &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\nI also worry about how this affects my friendships with others. This is one<br/>\nreason why I don&#39;t get involved as much as I should with our local support group<br/>\nas I can&#39;t always commit to things and<br/>\nsometimes show up and sometimes don&#39;t.

Hopefully<br/>\nthough we will through avoiding alot of revolting peer pressure etc, be able to<br/>\nhelp them grow even more in compassion and kindness and an ability to see the<br/>\n&#39;person&#39; inside. So yes - I think I can say my illness is shapING my kids for<br/>\ngood!

I went through two surgeries and six months of weekly <br/>\nchemotherapy, which wasn&#39;t fun to say the least.  My son was incredible.  We <br/>\ngently led him along the path with us, and he knew everything that was going <br/>\non.  He called me &quot;the droid&quot; when I had three drainage tubes coming out of <br/>\nmy body.  Those tubes had to be drained and the liquid measured twice a day, <br/>\nand my son watched my husband handled that disgusting process with such love <br/>\nand tenderness.  It was an invaluable experience for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I was pretty sick from the chemo, but we kept homeschooling.  Sometimes <br/>\nall we could manage was snuggling together in bed and reading wonderful <br/>\n&quot;living&quot; books, but it was enough.  I remember one night when we prayed <br/>\nbefore dinner.  We have a standard prayer that we say every night, but on <br/>\nthis night Colton wanted to pray something different.  He prayed that I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t become extinct like the dinosaurs, and I was very touched by that.  <br/>\nIt opened the door for a wonderful conversation where we talked about <br/>\nfighting cancer and the beauty of appreciating each moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n   My cancer was a gift, because we all have a heightened appreciation of <br/>\nwhat is truly important.  This life is indeed fleeting and fragile, and I <br/>\nhave resolved to live and love recklessly because I don&#39;t know how long I <br/>\nhave.  It&#39;s a lesson that I have taught my son, and we are all the better for <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"TM_s14zNVWiMLeD0D61hr_g6NbbFKA74ptmwMa161cgvNDIN4mFCt_6OYIqsEcjC5L9ke2HjGYjSJje7G6UM0mdg-w","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Illness","postDate":"950941790","msgId":6674,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40MjcuNjY3NC45NTkyNjk3NDZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6672,"nextInTopic":6675,"prevInTime":6673,"nextInTime":6675,"topicId":6672,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m a walking medical mess from kidney problems to a weird hip problem which means I don t walk too much and sometimes I fall without any warning.
