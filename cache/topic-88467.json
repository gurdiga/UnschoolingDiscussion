I&#39;ve had <br/>\nthree kids who didn&#39;t do it.  I didn&#39;t give them drinks that weren&#39;t in <br/>\nkid-cups, though, either, so that&#39;s part of it perhaps.  But I gave them lots of chances to pour liquids in appropriate places and times.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had three that didn&#39;t either. Good thing you didn&#39;t have that fourth child!!:)<br/>\nI have a child that regardless of advice to the contrary, regardless of how much water play, playdough etc... we give him he WILL smash playdough into innappropriate places and pour liquids in the damndest spots and generally wreck havoc. Three of mine did not, the fourth does.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t mean I just clean up his disasters without showing him the appropriate place to put liquids, or spit or whatever it happens to be that day...but he is just one of those very high spirited, intense individuals.  I do give him drinks in the car though, and he&#39;s done fairly well with those. <br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed that if he&#39;s getting tired or hungry or bored we get more intense behavior (of course) so most of the time it is still ME that can head things off at the pass.<br/>\nThere are usually creative solutions to help even intense three year olds function with balance in mind for the entire family...BUT, I&#39;ve never had a child that did things like Jalen does or contain the amazing amount of energy he possesses. He is also intensely loving and joyful, a truly incredible human being.<br/>\nI just feel bad for all the times the other kids get slighted because he requires so much time and attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.&quot;<br/>\nAlbert Einstein</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88565,"nextTopicId":88529}}
