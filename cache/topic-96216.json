At one point, I said that if the house had been <br/>\nour own, I&#39;d let her have at the wall in one area and not worry about <br/>\nit...but with everything going on at the time, just letting it be <br/>\nwasn&#39;t an option (if you&#39;ll recall I was having monthly DSS visits <br/>\nover other issues). <br/>\n<br/>\nBack when we lived in Bermuda, my Uncle Pete came to live with us for <br/>\nabout a year. His girlfriend Robin, now his wife, came to visit for a <br/>\ncouple weeks. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust before moving into our new apartment, we stayed with Uncle Pete <br/>\nand Aunt Robin for a night. Robin and I had clicked right away when <br/>\nwe met years ago, and I&#39;m thankful to be living close enough to visit <br/>\nmore often.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m rambling I think, but there is a point...when we went into the <br/>\nentryway of their house, the sunporch, I found that the walls are <br/>\nunfinished sheetrock with a few years&#39; worth of &quot;graffiti&quot; on them! <br/>\nIt was one of those projects that kept seeming to get forgotten to be <br/>\nfinished, and they&#39;ve decided NOT to finish them but rather keep the <br/>\nartwork and such as it is! <br/>\n<br/>\n:-) Cool, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96215,"nextTopicId":96213}}
