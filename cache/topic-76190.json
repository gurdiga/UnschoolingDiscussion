He answers questions online<br/>\n&gt;every day from people who want help with their pets. He writes to<br/>\n&gt;other people with his own questions etc.  So...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The most incredible thing has happened in the last ten years.<br/>\n&gt;We have kids who are dying to write... they just don&#39;t want to write<br/>\n&gt;for school. There is a ready-made audience of literally multiplied<br/>\n&gt;millions online wiating to hear from our kids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Last month, my son&#39;s visual basic friends who gather on a forum<br/>\n&gt;were discussing the merits of The Matrix Reloaded and debating<br/>\n&gt;some of the finer points in the script. My son was so thrilled with<br/>\n&gt;the dialog, he spent quite a bit of time refuting one person&#39;s point<br/>\n&gt;of view and then asked me to listen to it before posting to be<br/>\n&gt;sure he&#39;d expressed himself well enough. This is my oldest who<br/>\n&gt;&quot;doesn&#39;t&quot; like to write. Of course, he keeps a journal for<br/>\n&gt;&quot;significant events&quot; so he won&#39;t forget them, but he doesn&#39;t like to<br/>\n&gt;write. He discovered &quot;Live Journal&quot; online and has been<br/>\n&gt;recording all his feelings, thoughts, ideas there, but he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;like to write. He read the story of Gilgamesh online, saw a<br/>\n&gt;screenplay emerge in his head, wrote it out (32 pages) but,<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t like to write. The Internet has been key to his interest in<br/>\n&gt;writing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My daughter is involved in fanfix, posts regularly to an internet<br/>\n&gt;board and is on IM most days (apparently writing poetry and<br/>\n&gt;stories to each other, besides sorting out teen angst and<br/>\n&gt;gossip).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My next in line (11) subscribes to a discussion group for<br/>\n&gt;astronomy and reads there regularly. He asks questions of sites<br/>\n&gt;when he has them. He definitely doesn&#39;t like to write. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just joined Harry Potter for grown-ups and discovered that there<br/>\n&gt;are literally hundreds of discussion boards and groups for kids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now this is real writing! This is the kind of writing that makes you<br/>\n&gt;hone your arguments, gives you real life feedback and creates<br/>\n&gt;the writing impulse. Thank God for the Internet!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Julie B </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76187,"nextTopicId":76169}}
