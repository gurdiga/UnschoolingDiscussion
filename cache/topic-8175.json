You hear about this kind of  thing with babies, when they talk late<br/>\nbecause the older siblings do all the talking for them. Perhaps you could<br/>\nset aside a time daily or weekly and ask him if he has any questions. You<br/>\ncould also have him keep a journal and questions might pop up in his daily<br/>\nreflections. Of course if this isn&#39;t the reason, then these things may or<br/>\nmay not make a differnce. Just a suggestion.<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BandLHaney@...\">BandLHaney@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, April 16, 2000 11:13 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling Question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi all! I have a question that has been concerning me about my kids. I<br/>\nhave a<br/>\n&gt; 9 1/2yr. old son and a 7yr. old son. My 9 yr old will ask me every<br/>\nquestion<br/>\n&gt; under the sun about everything in life. Together we find and search out<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; answers to all his questions (and sometimes he reads and searches for<br/>\nanswers<br/>\n&gt; by himself). But, my 7 yr. old never asks us any questions about anything.<br/>\nHe<br/>\n&gt; loves dinosaurs and big trucks. He does a lot of dinosaur digging in the<br/>\nback<br/>\n&gt; yard and he plays with his trucks most of the day. He looks at picture<br/>\nbooks<br/>\n&gt; but doesn&#39;t yet read. I haven&#39;t pushed him in anyway to learn anything.<br/>\nBut,<br/>\n&gt; yet he asks us no questions about anything. Is this strange or normal or<br/>\n&gt; what? Is it because he learns in a different way? Should I be concerned or<br/>\n&gt; just let things be? Any suggestions? I would appreciate some advice about<br/>\n&gt; this.<br/>\n&gt; Lisa H.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Now the best and coolest websites come right to you based on your<br/>\n&gt; unique interests. eTour.com is surfing without searching.<br/>\n&gt; And, it&#39;s FREE!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3013/7/_/448294/_/955898014/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3013/7/_/448294/_/955898014/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To Unsubscribe: mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8170,"nextTopicId":8176}}
