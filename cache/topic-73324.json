I didn&#39;t know whether to laugh or scream. (I<br/>\n&gt; guess I did both because a couple of people stopped by my<br/>\n&gt; office to see if I was okay.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That was my reaction last week when I read this &quot;good news&quot;<br/>\n&gt; for menopausal women who suffer from hot flashes: A new study<br/>\n&gt; concludes that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor<br/>\n&gt; called paroxetine (better known as Paxil) can reduce the<br/>\n&gt; frequency and severity of hot flashes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is WONDERFUL news...if you happen to be on the board of<br/>\n&gt; directors of GlaxoSmithKline, the makers of Paxil.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But if you&#39;re among the many women who will hear about this<br/>\n&gt; and ask their doctors for a Paxil prescription, you might<br/>\n&gt; eventually find yourself wishing you could trade the Paxil<br/>\n&gt; for the hot flashes. The problem is, by then you might not be<br/>\n&gt; able to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; 3 out of 4 doctors recommend...<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s no need to spend a lot of time with the details of<br/>\n&gt; this study, so here are the bare bones: Researchers randomly<br/>\n&gt; selected a group of 165 menopausal women who experienced hot<br/>\n&gt; flashes and who were not taking a hormone replacement<br/>\n&gt; therapy. Roughly one-third of the group received 25 mg of<br/>\n&gt; Paxil daily, one-third received 12.5 mg daily, and one-third<br/>\n&gt; received a placebo. The frequency and severity of hot flashes<br/>\n&gt; were approximately reduced (on average) 65 percent in the<br/>\n&gt; first group, 62 percent in the second group, and 38 percent<br/>\n&gt; in the placebo group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The researchers concluded that Paxil may be &quot;an effective and<br/>\n&gt; acceptable&quot; therapy for treating hot flashes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Going just by the numbers of this study, it appears that<br/>\n&gt; Paxil does relieve hot flashes. So I&#39;ll let them<br/>\n&gt; have &quot;effective.&quot; But the word I have trouble with<br/>\n&gt; is &quot;acceptable.&quot; Because given the wide variety of problems<br/>\n&gt; that Paxil users have reported over the past decade, it would<br/>\n&gt; be stretching the point to call this drug acceptable. And the<br/>\n&gt; researchers are certainly well aware of the whole Paxil<br/>\n&gt; package because three of the four members of the research<br/>\n&gt; team are employees of GlaxoSmithKline.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nice. I think it was right there I might have screamed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; A good trade off?<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Because this study was conducted at Johns Hopkins Medical<br/>\n&gt; School, and because it was published in the Journal of the<br/>\n&gt; American Medical Association (JAMA), there&#39;s no doubt that<br/>\n&gt; doctors all over the country will be intoning these<br/>\n&gt; prestigious names when assuring their menopausal patients<br/>\n&gt; that Paxil is an &quot;effective and acceptable&quot; treatment for<br/>\n&gt; their hot flashes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Acceptable? Here are some of Paxil&#39;s side effects described<br/>\n&gt; as &quot;frequent&quot;: hypertension, impaired concentration, nausea,<br/>\n&gt; vomiting, emotional instability, vertigo, inflammation of the<br/>\n&gt; mucus membrane, rapid heart beat, weight gain, and temporary<br/>\n&gt; suspension of consciousness. And here&#39;s my favorite frequent<br/>\n&gt; side effect: depression. That&#39;s right - the very thing that<br/>\n&gt; Paxil is designed to relieve.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s worse is that some patients report even worse side<br/>\n&gt; effects when they try to discontinue their Paxil use. For<br/>\n&gt; many years GlaxoSmithKline assured consumers that Paxil was<br/>\n&gt; non-habit forming and easy to discontinue. Meanwhile, case<br/>\n&gt; after case reported that patients coming off the drug<br/>\n&gt; experienced nightmares, dizziness, burning and itching of the<br/>\n&gt; skin, agitation, sweating and nausea. And for many of those<br/>\n&gt; patients, the only way to treat the side effects was to begin<br/>\n&gt; taking Paxil again! And then, just to make it official, last<br/>\n&gt; year the FDA issued a warning that withdrawal symptoms from<br/>\n&gt; Paxil may be severe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All of these things are well known about Paxil. So who (other<br/>\n&gt; than GlaxoSmithKline employees) could possibly characterize<br/>\n&gt; Paxil as an acceptable trade off for hot flashes?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; A little spin on the side<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ABC television coverage about the JAMA study reported that<br/>\n&gt; the researchers &quot;believe&quot; that Paxil is &quot;more promising&quot; than<br/>\n&gt; alternative therapies such as vitamin E and black cohosh.<br/>\n&gt; Their study had nothing whatsoever to do with any alternative<br/>\n&gt; therapies, but ABC kindly helped them create the impression<br/>\n&gt; that Paxil trumps natural methods of coping with hot flashes.<br/>\n&gt; Of course, ABC didn&#39;t mention the GSK connection to the<br/>\n&gt; study. They wouldn&#39;t want to offend a drug manufacturer that<br/>\n&gt; buys plenty of TV advertising for its other products,<br/>\n&gt; including Gaviscon, Contac, Tums, Tagament, Flonase, Zantac,<br/>\n&gt; Nicorette, and Aquafresh toothpaste.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In an e-Alert I sent you last month (&quot;Spin This&quot; 5/29/03), I<br/>\n&gt; told you about a number of alternative therapies that have<br/>\n&gt; relieved menopause symptoms for HSI members. Contrary to what<br/>\n&gt; the Johns Hopkins researchers would have ABC believe, many<br/>\n&gt; women find black cohosh to be very effective in controlling<br/>\n&gt; hot flashes. And if black cohosh doesn&#39;t work, there are<br/>\n&gt; other safe and natural methods to try, including red clover,<br/>\n&gt; wild yam progesterone cream, indium sulfate, and vitamin E.<br/>\n&gt; (One member wrote to tell us that daily doses of 2000 mg of<br/>\n&gt; vitamin C and 400 IU of vitamin E reduced her frequency of<br/>\n&gt; hot flashes from 10 each day, to only one. Side effects:<br/>\n&gt; none.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; The larger picture<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think that one of the primary reasons why women ultimately<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t be happy using Paxil is that there&#39;s much more to<br/>\n&gt; menopause symptoms than just hot flashes. In other words,<br/>\n&gt; Paxil can&#39;t address menopause as a whole.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some time ago I told you about a special report titled &quot;Look<br/>\n&gt; and Feel Your Best,&quot; written by HSI Panelist Linda Page,<br/>\n&gt; N.D., Ph.D. - a noted author and a doctor of holistic<br/>\n&gt; medicine. In &quot;Look and Feel Your Best&quot; Dr. Page shows women<br/>\n&gt; how to make their way through menopause naturally, without<br/>\n&gt; using hormone replacement therapy. She emphasizes that<br/>\n&gt; menopause is actually nature&#39;s way of protecting women from<br/>\n&gt; breast and uterine cancer by rebalancing hormone production -<br/>\n&gt; a process that no one should try to defeat with<br/>\n&gt; pharmaceuticals. Read more at<br/>\n&gt; http://www.agora-inc.com/reports/610SHORM/W610D611/home.cfm<br/>\n&gt; to find out about how Dr. Page&#39;s techniques can make the<br/>\n&gt; difference between just surviving menopause, and emerging<br/>\n&gt; from it happier and healthier.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best of all, this report is guaranteed NOT to cause<br/>\n&gt; hypertension, impaired concentration, nausea, vomiting,<br/>\n&gt; emotional instability, vertigo, inflammation of the mucus<br/>\n&gt; membrane, rapid heart beat, weight gain, and temporary<br/>\n&gt; suspension of consciousness. But if you&#39;re feeling blue due<br/>\n&gt; to menopause symptoms, it just might help lift you out of<br/>\n&gt; depression.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **************************************************************<br/>\n&gt;                 LOSE UP TO 20 POUNDS IN 90 DAYS<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Major scientific studies prove that two all-natural plant<br/>\n&gt; extracts can help you, jump start your metabolism, stimulate<br/>\n&gt; your body&#39;s natural fat-burning ability, reduce body weight<br/>\n&gt; by up to 14% in 8 weeks, normalize blood sugar levels, boost<br/>\n&gt; your energy and wipe away the dieting &quot;blues.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One key ingredient has helped people lose up to 20 pounds in<br/>\n&gt; 90 days - without caffeine or ephedra.

An HSI member named Adam<br/>\n&gt; heard, and sent these comments:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;It is a shame that the results of the study shows no weight<br/>\n&gt; change after a year. There are too many drop outs for the<br/>\n&gt; statistics to be non biased. Would like to see your<br/>\n&gt; comments.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While the results of these studies had their drawbacks, the<br/>\n&gt; details are not as negative as Adam seems to think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Both studies (from the University of Pennsylvania) compared<br/>\n&gt; the Atkins high-protein diet to a high-carbohydrate/low-fat<br/>\n&gt; diet in obese subjects. In both trials (one lasted 6 months,<br/>\n&gt; and the other a year) the Atkins groups lost more weight than<br/>\n&gt; the high-carb groups. In the year-long study, participants of<br/>\n&gt; both groups gained back some of their initial weight loss.<br/>\n&gt; The authors of the study called the differences between the<br/>\n&gt; final net weight losses of the two groups &quot;statistically<br/>\n&gt; insignificant.&quot; And that&#39;s true. But in the end, the Atkins<br/>\n&gt; group lost more than the high-carb group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This may not sound like a resounding success, but it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; success just the same. Because until just recently very few<br/>\n&gt; mainstream nutrition or dietary experts would have ever<br/>\n&gt; imagined that in a one-year controlled trial a high-protein<br/>\n&gt; diet could succeed over a low-fat diet. &quot;Low fat equals good<br/>\n&gt; health&quot; has been the mainstream mantra for more than 20<br/>\n&gt; years, but with these studies and others, that mantra is<br/>\n&gt; being challenged like never before.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And while it&#39;s true that there were dropouts in each of the<br/>\n&gt; groups in both studies (as there are in virtually all long-<br/>\n&gt; term dietary trials - especially with obese subjects), the<br/>\n&gt; dropouts were not so many that the test results were<br/>\n&gt; invalidated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Beyond the fact that the Atkins diet clearly bested the high-<br/>\n&gt; carb diet, these equally important results stand out as well:<br/>\n&gt; In the one-year trial, the Atkins group had a significantly<br/>\n&gt; greater increase in HDL cholesterol, and their triglyceride<br/>\n&gt; levels decreased more than in the high-carb group. Similar<br/>\n&gt; results occurred in the 6-month trial, with the Atkins group<br/>\n&gt; showing greater triglyceride reduction and increased insulin<br/>\n&gt; sensitivity compared to the other group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think we&#39;re so used to seeing wild claims on TV ads (&quot;I<br/>\n&gt; lost 50 pound in two days!&quot;) that the results of a<br/>\n&gt; controlled, year-long trial like this may not seem<br/>\n&gt; impressive. In fact, these are very important mainstream<br/>\n&gt; successes for a diet that was almost universally dismissed by<br/>\n&gt; the nutritional establishment for 30 years.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Somewhere Dr. Atkins is smiling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To Your Good Health,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jenny Thompson<br/>\n&gt; Health Sciences Institute<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **************************************************************<br/>\n&gt;         KEEP YOUR BODY YOUNG, ALIVE & FULLY FUNCTIONING<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; New research reveals revolutionary sound technology - the<br/>\n&gt; same technology that enhances memory - can dramatically<br/>\n&gt; increase longevity, slow aging and lower stress.
