This IS their home, they are welcomed <br/>\nhere, loved and respected, they will/may move on in life and be elsewhere but <br/>\nthis house, this building filled with their memories (and still their THINGS) <br/>\nwill always be a part of them and therefore it wouldn&#39;t be up to me to &quot;let&quot; them <br/>\nbe here.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, their father... well, he&#39;s learning, and being more respectful I have to <br/>\nsay and he&#39;s understanding that sometimes children/young adults don&#39;t have <br/>\nall the answers and we cannot give them to them.  It&#39;s a searching process that <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be college or work but maybe some of both or something in between.  <br/>\nEighteen is young for some, old for others but how in the world can we expect <br/>\nour children/young adults to KNOW what life holds for them without some <br/>\nexploration?<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember in nursing school they said that they had a practice of ALWAYS <br/>\ndoing the nursing home rotations first, which is by far the hardest.  The <br/>\nreasoning they gave was that they would hate for a student to think nursing was their <br/>\nlives work, spend years pursuing it, come down to the end and do the nursing <br/>\nhome rotation and quit.  It seemed a waste to them.  That was when their <br/>\nhighest number of students dropped nursing so they put it first and weeded out <br/>\nthose that were going to leave anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the time I wasn&#39;t sure how I felt about that.  There is so MUCH more that <br/>\ncomes after the beginning, so much between geriatrics and growing family, I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t understand how others could try to influence the decisions of some and <br/>\nmake them think it was for their benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I see it&#39;s just a part of the way life is really.  Not necessarily a <br/>\nwonderful thing at all, but not entirely all bad.  Depends on one&#39;s ability to <br/>\npush forward and to really work for what they want, IF they even know they <br/>\nreally want it.  The BEAUTY of it, is that it&#39;s almost NEVER to late to find a <br/>\npassion, a desire, to fulfill a dream that was once out of reach for any number of <br/>\nreasons.  Probably a full third of the nurses in my graduating class were <br/>\nmothers of children nearly grown and coming back to a passion/dream they held <br/>\nlong ago, or even just recently discovered.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they were finally able to nurture themselves and give themselves <br/>\npermission to follow a dream?

I think it sets up <br/>\n  unrealistic <br/>\n  expectations about what adult life is, and can be.   I&#39;m trying to figure out <br/>\n  what my job is here, isn&#39;t it to raise him so that he can live his own life, <br/>\n  responsibilities and all? Isn&#39;t it a failure on my part if he comes home, <br/>\n  unable <br/>\n  or unwilling to deal with independence? **<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think Americans have an unhealthy reverence for the idea of total <br/>\n  independence. I think it sets people up to always feel like they&#39;re not quite doing it <br/>\n  all right, because total independence is a total impossibility. I think <br/>\n  healthy interdependence is a good goal to work toward, and I think that includes the <br/>\n  idea that yes, you CAN come home again. Coming home is not necessarily a <br/>\n  failure or an indication of being unable or unwilling to deal with independence.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve been thinking about this topic a lot lately. I know a LOT of kids who <br/>\n  are going to college even though they&#39;re not sure what they want or expect out <br/>\n  of the experience, and a few who are pretty sure they really don&#39;t want college <br/>\n  but are afraid not to go because that&#39;s the only way their parents are still <br/>\n  willing to support them. Some are going to study things they aren&#39;t much <br/>\n  interested in as a &quot;back up&quot; hoping they&#39;ll figure out a way to do what they really <br/>\n  want to do after college is over. All the adults I know who went that route <br/>\n  are still doing the &quot;back up&quot; jobs decades later, having never really tried to <br/>\n  follow their (usually artistic) dreams. My own daughter, I&#39;m supporting by <br/>\n  saying &quot;Do it now if you want. Try it now if you want. What&#39;s the worst that <br/>\n  could happen? You give it up in a few years and end up living back with us or some <br/>\n  other relative for awhile while you dust yourself off and move on? No <br/>\n  problem.  There are plenty of people who love you all over the country. We&#39;ll be your <br/>\n  back up&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My current thoughts. :)<br/>\n  Deborah in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Coming home is not necessarily a <br/>\nfailure or an indication of being unable or unwilling to deal with independence.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking about this topic a lot lately. I know a LOT of kids who <br/>\nare going to college even though they&#39;re not sure what they want or expect out <br/>\nof the experience, and a few who are pretty sure they really don&#39;t want college <br/>\nbut are afraid not to go because that&#39;s the only way their parents are still <br/>\nwilling to support them. Some are going to study things they aren&#39;t much <br/>\ninterested in as a &quot;back up&quot; hoping they&#39;ll figure out a way to do what they really <br/>\nwant to do after college is over. All the adults I know who went that route <br/>\nare still doing the &quot;back up&quot; jobs decades later, having never really tried to <br/>\nfollow their (usually artistic) dreams. My own daughter, I&#39;m supporting by <br/>\nsaying &quot;Do it now if you want. Try it now if you want. What&#39;s the worst that <br/>\ncould happen? You give it up in a few years and end up living back with us or some <br/>\nother relative for awhile while you dust yourself off and move on? No <br/>\nproblem.  There are plenty of people who love you all over the country. We&#39;ll be your <br/>\nback up&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy current thoughts. :)<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70954,"nextTopicId":70958}}
