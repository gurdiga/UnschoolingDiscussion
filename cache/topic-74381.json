The 2002 General Assembly approved two bills sponsored <br/>\nby Del. Bob Marshall (R-13th), creating several faith and family-friendly auto <br/>\nlicense plates. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne bill authorizes license plates bearing the phrase &quot;Education Begins at <br/>\nHome.&quot; The state of Virginia requires the specialty plate sponsors to collect <br/>\n350 pre-paid orders before a production run is authorized. Currently, the Home <br/>\nEducators of Virginia are collecting orders for these plates. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72760,"nextTopicId":74365}}
