Maybe a sign of  <br/>\nthe plantlover I was to become. <br/>\n-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nThat was generous and noble, because they&#39;re a pain to transport.<br/>\nI&#39;ve thought of bringing one to St. Louis as a show&#39;n&#39;tell, but it would  <br/>\ntake as much room as a person in the van.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve never thought of myself as a plant lover, really, but yesterday when I  <br/>\nwas working on those pages I was getting more and more excited, and this <br/>\nmorning  when I went to the post office to mail stuff, there was a new set of <br/>\n37cent  stamps on display, four different flowering bulbs, and we have ALL FOUR in <br/>\nour  yard.  Very exciting.  And in those colors, too--bearded iris purple  <br/>\nwith yellow (which were in our yard when we bought the house, but they were  <br/>\ndormant and sad from nine years&#39; neglect and now they&#39;re quite fat&#39;n&#39;happy) and  <br/>\npink and white striped tulips (which didn&#39;t come up last year but did THIS and  <br/>\nsurprised us; from a box of bulbs Keith won at Rowland&#39;s nursery for guessing <br/>\n how many were in the box)...<br/>\n <br/>\nSo I was thinking, yesterday, about why I&#39;ve pushed back my plant  interest.  <br/>\nFor many years it just didn&#39;t fit with my medieval music and art  interests, <br/>\nand we didn&#39;t have room at the old house for any indoor plants and it  was all <br/>\nwe could do in the yard to get the stickers gone so the babies could  play <br/>\nbarefooted.    <br/>\n <br/>\nBut now I&#39;m in a house I&#39;ll probably stay in for the rest of my life, and  <br/>\nthe yard is bigger, and there are some deep windowsills, and we&#39;re not so poor  <br/>\nthat to buy day lilly bulbs is totally out of the question (as we were for a  <br/>\nlong time).  I can afford potting soil (and we also have room for a big  <br/>\ncompost pile).   It makes a difference.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd when I was writing those pages I realized that it was school.   School <br/>\nkept me from thinking I had the right to mess with plants.  I didn&#39;t  like <br/>\nbiology.  People don&#39;t go on to more particular studies without liking  biology and <br/>\nchemistry.  You don&#39;t earn botany or genetics without being  good at <br/>\nchemistry.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy cousin, Nada (who grew up with me, shared a room until we were  14&15), <br/>\nused to work at a greenhouse, but she also could keep  houseplants alive for <br/>\nyears, so I thought she knew things I didn&#39;t know.   She just stayed in bigger <br/>\nhouses longer, while I was moving from back room to  temporary other place.<br/>\n <br/>\nYears passed while I didn&#39;t think about whether I liked plants.  I&#39;ve  grown <br/>\ntrees from seeds and saplings in that time, it&#39;s been so long.  And  hey, I <br/>\nwas growing trees!!  Still didn&#39;t notice.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s fun and funny when a big interest can be indwelling in someone for  <br/>\nyears and they don&#39;t notice.   I was like that about early music, when  I was a <br/>\nteen.  I had totally compartmentalized my various musical  interests, and not <br/>\nuntil I graduated and went to tell my old teachers I was  going to teach and <br/>\nthey&#39;d all say &quot;Music?&quot; that it had occurred to me it might  be something one <br/>\ncould study.  No, I&#39;d studied English and psychology and  anthropology.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWithin a few years I realized what I really liked was early music and  <br/>\nshould&#39;ve known from the hymns I liked at church, the ballads I liked when I  played <br/>\nguitar and sang, and the recorder I had learned and gotten pretty good  at.   <br/>\nKinda &quot;duh&quot; to other people, but I was so busy I hadn&#39;t  noticed.<br/>\n <br/>\nI guess I&#39;ve been so busy since then I didn&#39;t notice I also like  plants  <br/>\nCool!<br/>\nI don&#39;t think my kids will have this problem of thinking they need to have  a <br/>\nlittle resume and good grades to claim interest or knowledge.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":202023256,"authorName":"mfhickman@comcast.net","from":"mfhickman@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"re:tumbleweed","postDate":"1115052353","msgId":105831,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA1MDIyMDA1MTY0NS4yNDkwOC40Mjc2NTk0MDAwMDg3N0Q2MDAwMDYxNEMyMjA3MDAyOTUzMDIwRTAzMDUwQzA3MDgwMDAzQGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":105835,"prevInTime":105830,"nextInTime":105832,"topicId":105831,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I just looked over your baby tumbleweed shots, which brought back a memory I have.
