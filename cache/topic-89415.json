I actually find <br/>\nthe Tao Te Ching the most &#39;unschooling-friendly&#39; <br/>\nspritual/practical/ethical of all texts and it is very much in accord <br/>\nwith the basic tenets of christianity (Thomas Merton would approve).  <br/>\nBut it is not a sacred text; it is not based on a religion or a church.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually was a religion studies freak growing up.

That&#39;s how I got to Joseph Campbell and Elaine Pagels <br/>\n(looooove anything written by them) ... and I can&#39;t wait to read the <br/>\n&#39;Da Vinci Code&#39; (it sounds like something Umberto Eco would have <br/>\nwritten, aka &#39;The Name of the Rose&#39;).

The <br/>\nnativity story and the flight to Egypt is one of the best suspense <br/>\nstories ever written. I just have come to a point in my life that I am <br/>\nnot attached to the meaning of these stories. To me they are not <br/>\nfactual. Is non-attachment to those stories another myth? Maybe. Then <br/>\nagain, non-attachment is a practice, the story &quot;virgin birth&quot; on the <br/>\nother hand is found across many cultures --just like the story of the <br/>\nsacrificial lamb and the messiah.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I just rambled at the moment ... back to unschooling religion. <br/>\nI knew BIG changes where happening in my life when, after having Evan, <br/>\nI was not quite sure I&#39;d dig the idea of baptism. I still had to ask <br/>\nMark how he felt about it and he strongly rejected the idea --actually <br/>\nhe was shocked I had asked, having known the kind of alternative <br/>\nreligious studies I had done for years. That was the beginning of the <br/>\nend of my life as my mother&#39;s child.
