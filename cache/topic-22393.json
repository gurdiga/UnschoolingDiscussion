This is one of the reasons I do not let my children surf the web unsupervised. I accessed a porn site through a search on child education. Part of it is the addictiveness of it. I wonder how many people have become addicted to porn who were not originally intending to use the web for porn? I think some of these people do it to try to lure more people into their perversions.<br/>\nJohanna &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was watching a comedy show on BET the other night, the comedian was discussing how porn &quot;kicked his a$$&quot;.  He said, that he went to a site out of curiosity, tried to get out, and it kept kicking up more and more porn.  He went back to original site again and again over time, and kept getting a &quot;fetish&quot; type window - finally he clicked on it.  At first he was disgusted, clicked off, over the near future, he kept going back to the fetish site as it was like watching a train wreck, and then finally - thought it was cool.  He then tried some of the stuff on his significant other, and she &quot;kicked his a$$&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoral of the story, you see something, and think it is gross - but the more and more one sees said item, the newness wears off and it seems cool.  I suppose this could be applied to most anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren Mowery<br/>\n(please note, I severely edited the comedians material)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22389,"nextTopicId":22404}}
