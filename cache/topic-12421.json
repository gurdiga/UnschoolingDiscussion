If your husband is working all the time, he must be tired and<br/>\nstressed. This (along with his own upbringing) may cause him to feel he<br/>\nneeds to &quot;keep the kids in line&quot;.

If it&#39;s a real &quot;issue&quot; (like one hitting<br/>\nthe other) then my reaction is the same, but the volume of my voice is<br/>\ngreater under stress, I know. I don&#39;t know if this helps, but I was hoping<br/>\nif you could understand _why_ your husband felt this way, you could better<br/>\nhandle it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy recommended reading is &quot;Dare to Discipline&quot; by James Dobson....discipline<br/>\nmeaning to correct and lead, not thrash.<br/>\n<br/>\n----Valerie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12575,"nextTopicId":12354}}
