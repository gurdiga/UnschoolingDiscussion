I refuse to <br/>\nstart talking about people offlist as you seem to be intent on doing. Trying <br/>\nto get people to take sides with you or Sandra is futile. I disagree with <br/>\nSandra many times. . . just ask her. I have no problem with stating my <br/>\nopinion even when it is different from hers. If I perceive an insult from her <br/>\nthen I have made it my problem.  The way I try to read posts is from the <br/>\nstandpoint that everyone  is coming from a place of sincerely wanting to help <br/>\nand offer viewpoints that they believe may help people. This is what I <br/>\nbelieve to be true of Sandra, even though I may disagree with her on some <br/>\nthings. This is what I try to believe of everyone on here. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a great opportunity here . . . to learn. I, for one, am going to <br/>\nfocus on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27808,"nextTopicId":27826}}
