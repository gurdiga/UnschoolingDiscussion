Of<br/>\ncourse, the whole media system and the educational system are designed to<br/>\ndrive critical thoughts from your mind. You&#39;re taught to be a passive,<br/>\nobedient follower. And unless you can break out of those habits, you&#39;ll be<br/>\na victim of propoganda. But it&#39;s not that hard to break out.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, congratulations to each of you for breaking out - and for raising<br/>\ncritical thinkers!<br/>\n<br/>\nAloha, Lee<br/>\nNORTH COUNTRY FARMS<br/>\n~an eco-tourism destination~<br/>\nP.O.
