I don&#39;t think the people who<br/>\nquestion your family size are really coming from a pro-choice stance, I<br/>\nthink they&#39;re just obnoxious people who probably think everyone should be<br/>\njust like them.  I face the same criticism, but in reverse, we have one<br/>\nchild, and we have no plans for more.

I refuse to explain to any of<br/>\nthem why we have an only child, there is no way to win this conversation,<br/>\njust as there is no way to win an argument on abortion.  These are issues<br/>\nthat people have already made up their minds on, and too often there is no<br/>\ntolerance nor understanding of  anyone who may have a different opinion<br/>\n(usually due to having a different life experience).

I live in northern Illinois and <br/>\nwe have several no-kill shelters here and there is a demand for <br/>\npuppies, kittens and previously owned pets.  As much as putting <br/>\nanimals in gas chambers is an upsetting and unpleasant thought, I&#39;m <br/>\nnot sure how it really ties into &quot;pro-life&quot; issues.  My understanding <br/>\nof &quot;pro-life&quot; has to do with humans from conception to death, not <br/>\nwith animals.  I will say that I firmly believe there is quite a <br/>\ndistinction between humans and animals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that pro-lifers aren&#39;t the ones cramming &quot;choice&quot; down other <br/>\npeople&#39;s throats and are not the ones who falsely make claims about <br/>\nhow &quot;choice&quot; helps humanity.  It seems that &quot;pro-choicers&quot; have that <br/>\nmarket covered.  More confusion sets in upon reading, <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There are children suffering WAY more than euthenized pets are.  <br/>\nThey suffer for years and YEARS, past the natural lifespan of a dog, <br/>\nand yet the argument that they can have an entirely horrible life of <br/>\nabuse and deprivation is pooh-poohed by right-wing Christians in <br/>\ncomfortable homes who don&#39;t let their children associate with the <br/>\nvery people whose reproductive rights they want to control.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I to understand that children who are to be born into poverty, <br/>\nabuse or inhuman conditions should be terminated before birth?  Or <br/>\nthat human suffering would be under control if &quot;pro-choice&quot; issues <br/>\nand &quot;reproductive rights&quot; were everyone&#39;s belief?  What about people <br/>\nwho willingly and lovingly bring their children into the world only <br/>\nto find that their lives change drastically over time?  Examples of <br/>\nthis would be job loss & homelessness; or sickness that creates <br/>\npoverty for the family; or a divorced woman who takes up with a <br/>\nboyfriend only to find that he has beaten, raped and killed her <br/>\nchild?  The list can go on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd speaking of &quot;reproductive rights they want to control&quot;, does <br/>\nanybody realize that if you are pro-life, pro-natural family <br/>\nplanning, pro-God&#39;s will & the faith to do His will, that you are <br/>\nunder constant attack by &quot;pro-choicers&quot;?  From family, to doctors, to <br/>\nother &quot;faithful&quot; people, to strangers or obviously others on this <br/>\nunschooling list, we never hear the end of it.  That strikes me as <br/>\nironic since we don&#39;t go around shoving our beliefs down other <br/>\npeople&#39;s throats and we don&#39;t try to &quot;convince&quot; others to follow our <br/>\nbeliefs.

Our pets, not breeding stock, are neutered. It would seem<br/>\n&gt; rather silly to neuter our breeding stock now wouldn&#39;t it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is a shame that too many animals are killed whether it is a no longer<br/>\n&gt; wanted pet, an unwanted litter of kittens, or beef cattle. I understand<br/>\nwhere<br/>\n&gt; you are coming from but maybe you should be clear on your facts before you<br/>\n&gt; start telling us what to do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First off my children are 17 to 11 yrs in age. They are not small children<br/>\n&gt; who have no idea what they are getting into. They know so much about<br/>\nanimals,<br/>\n&gt; including dogs, that it amazes me. They are not the idiots that you are<br/>\n&gt; portraying them to be. I did not have my children start raising animals to<br/>\n&gt; teach them responsibility. I agreed to go along with them and help them.<br/>\nIn<br/>\n&gt; other words, I support their dreams and ambitions. I really do not<br/>\nappreciate<br/>\n&gt; you telling me that we are not smart enough to understand the science of<br/>\n&gt; breeding. I cannot believe that you think we would actually be breeding<br/>\nmixed<br/>\n&gt; breeds, give us some credit. My kids have a great love for animals. That<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; why they exercise and train their animals daily and would never leave them<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; little cages like some. They have been training dogs now for several<br/>\nyears,<br/>\n&gt; using our pets as their subjects. And may I say that I am amazed at what<br/>\n&gt; those dogs can learn to do. Two of my children are very interested in<br/>\nraising<br/>\n&gt; and training dogs for the disabled and are at the moment waiting for some<br/>\n&gt; information we ordered about doing this. It is their dream to raise dogs<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; the disabled. In case you did not know there is a big shortage of dogs<br/>\n&gt; trained in this field.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you are really wanting to get rid of all dog breeders then do it. Go<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; it, write your congress or whatever, do what it takes, if that is your<br/>\n&gt; desire. Be passionate about it and fight to do away with dogs as pets. Do<br/>\n&gt; what you think is best. Make a stand. Exactly what will happen to the<br/>\n&gt; existence of dogs if it becomes illegal to breed them is a thought. After<br/>\nall<br/>\n&gt; it sounded like you are against the breeding of all dogs not just the ones<br/>\n&gt; that are allowed to have unwanted pups. Usually dog breeders do not have<br/>\n&gt; unwanted pups.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I call the pups we have now breeding stock because they are pure breed<br/>\ndogs<br/>\n&gt; that we do plan to breed someday. That does not mean that they are not<br/>\nloved,<br/>\n&gt; respected, given attention to, and apart of this family. We never plan to<br/>\n&gt; become a large breeder with hundreds of dogs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since we live 60 miles form the local animal shelter the kids will not be<br/>\n&gt; volunteering there anytime soon but you may be interested in knowing that<br/>\nour<br/>\n&gt; pets did come from that pound.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Any dog breeder or animal shelter will tell you that as the adult in the<br/>\n&gt; house, the dog is ultimately the adults responsibility.  These are living<br/>\n&gt; creatures, not a rock collection. &lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Guess they should try raising responsible children. I am insulted that you<br/>\n&gt; think I or my children are not intelligent to know that animals take more<br/>\n&gt; care than rocks. You are lumping me in with people who drop their dogs<br/>\n&gt; (animals) off at shelters to be killed. I do not, and will not.

Our pets, not breeding stock, are neutered. It would seem <br/>\nrather silly to neuter our breeding stock now wouldn&#39;t it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a shame that too many animals are killed whether it is a no longer <br/>\nwanted pet, an unwanted litter of kittens, or beef cattle. I understand where <br/>\nyou are coming from but maybe you should be clear on your facts before you <br/>\nstart telling us what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off my children are 17 to 11 yrs in age. They are not small children <br/>\nwho have no idea what they are getting into. They know so much about animals, <br/>\nincluding dogs, that it amazes me. They are not the idiots that you are <br/>\nportraying them to be. I did not have my children start raising animals to <br/>\nteach them responsibility. I agreed to go along with them and help them. In <br/>\nother words, I support their dreams and ambitions. I really do not appreciate <br/>\nyou telling me that we are not smart enough to understand the science of <br/>\nbreeding. I cannot believe that you think we would actually be breeding mixed <br/>\nbreeds, give us some credit. My kids have a great love for animals. That is <br/>\nwhy they exercise and train their animals daily and would never leave them in <br/>\nlittle cages like some. They have been training dogs now for several years, <br/>\nusing our pets as their subjects. And may I say that I am amazed at what <br/>\nthose dogs can learn to do. Two of my children are very interested in raising <br/>\nand training dogs for the disabled and are at the moment waiting for some <br/>\ninformation we ordered about doing this. It is their dream to raise dogs for <br/>\nthe disabled. In case you did not know there is a big shortage of dogs <br/>\ntrained in this field. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are really wanting to get rid of all dog breeders then do it. Go for <br/>\nit, write your congress or whatever, do what it takes, if that is your <br/>\ndesire. Be passionate about it and fight to do away with dogs as pets. Do <br/>\nwhat you think is best. Make a stand. Exactly what will happen to the <br/>\nexistence of dogs if it becomes illegal to breed them is a thought. After all <br/>\nit sounded like you are against the breeding of all dogs not just the ones <br/>\nthat are allowed to have unwanted pups. Usually dog breeders do not have <br/>\nunwanted pups. <br/>\n<br/>\nI call the pups we have now breeding stock because they are pure breed dogs <br/>\nthat we do plan to breed someday. That does not mean that they are not loved, <br/>\nrespected, given attention to, and apart of this family. We never plan to <br/>\nbecome a large breeder with hundreds of dogs. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince we live 60 miles form the local animal shelter the kids will not be <br/>\nvolunteering there anytime soon but you may be interested in knowing that our <br/>\npets did come from that pound. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Any dog breeder or animal shelter will tell you that as the adult in the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>house, the dog is ultimately the adults responsibility.

Animal welfare is a concern I will have<br/>\nuntil my death because of that experience, and one I hope to pass on to<br/>\nmy children.  PLEASE check into neutering and spaying your dogs offspring<br/>\nand finding responsible homes for any puppies you place.  Your dog may<br/>\nhave a litter of 8 puppies.  Even if you place each of those 8 puppies,<br/>\neach of them could have a litter of 8 puppies and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Shelley S.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15540,"nextTopicId":15555}}
