I&#39;d like to figure out how <br/>\nto do it with all that wonderful calm joyful attitude that people here <br/>\ntalk about it - but to me it is boring boring boring and more boring. <br/>\nWhen I&#39;m not feeling great, too, I just can&#39;t make myself do much of it. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to do so much of it, just a little.<br/>\nI mean if you wanted to practice the attitude.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPut on music you can sing along to and that will make you feel like dancing, <br/>\nand it makes the time go by more happily.  Or plan a presentation in your <br/>\nhead, or be making a list for something (have the paper and pencil there, but <br/>\nwork cleaning whatever until you think of another item.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I do, anyway, is I do two things at once and the housework is the <br/>\nmindless one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to HATE the resentment of &quot;Why should *I* do this?&quot; and so I just <br/>\ndecided to change what I thought about what &quot;this&quot; was and why anyone had to <br/>\ndo it.  It was a philosophical shift.  But I still like to play music.<br/>\n<br/>\nFloors, I don&#39;t like.  I need to really steam clean the carpet in the <br/>\nlibrary, but it would involve putting so many things up I can&#39;t think of <br/>\ndoing it.  But when it gets springlike I&#39;ll ask the kids to help me get the <br/>\nfloor clear, and open the doors and windows up there and just DO it.  It will <br/>\nkill a whole day but I&#39;ll play loud music and sing and get it done.  And <br/>\nwe&#39;ll all be happier for a while, in that room.  Other teens have taken to <br/>\ncoming and gaming there a couple of times a week, and it&#39;s still a dormitory <br/>\nwhen necessary (concerts and SCA events bring relatives and friends from <br/>\noutlying towns), and the kids feel as much ownership and need of that as they <br/>\ndo their own rooms, for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll never have a really spiffy, decorated house.  But I have figured out <br/>\nways to accept that instead of berating myself, and ways to be happier when I <br/>\nDO declutter and clean.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60107,"nextTopicId":59911}}
