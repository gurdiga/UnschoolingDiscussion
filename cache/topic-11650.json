Then the thoughtful answers I received really <br/>\nstrengthened my resolve and made me realize that I can and should do <br/>\nsomething about this situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am saving all the postings to re-read because there were so many great <br/>\nideas. I am going to look at trying the 3 strikes and you&#39;re out method, <br/>\nwhich I have actually heard of before in a slightly different form. I think <br/>\nI would need to find something very specific to apply this to, such as <br/>\nname-calling or yelling &quot;shut up.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI also agree totally that when I respond in kind by yelling it just makes it <br/>\nworse -- as someone put it, &quot;Suddenly you have two 5yo&#39;s in the room!&quot; I <br/>\nneed to be calm. For that, I need to be rested and collected, as much as <br/>\npossible. I do appreciate the people who urged me to &quot;take care of myself.&quot; <br/>\nThat&#39;s a necessity for having patience. When I&#39;m very tired or feeling <br/>\ncranky/resentful, I have no patience and quickly devolve into a 5yo!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you are all wonderful. It is so valuable to me to have a group like <br/>\nthis to turn to, with people of such varied backgrounds and ages. I really <br/>\ntook to heart the words of the mother of nine, I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t have your <br/>\nname in front of me at this moment. But as someone else said, with nine <br/>\nkids, you have lots of credibility and experience. Also, Kiraul and Cathie, <br/>\nyou seemed to have a really loving yet firm approach that I strive for <br/>\nmyself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there may also be some validity to the notion that some of this <br/>\nreally rank behavior has to do with the kids&#39; age and stage. I know that in <br/>\nthe past, sometimes when I was at wits&#39; end with something, it would <br/>\nsuddenly just go away, whether it was from some physical cause or, as <br/>\nsomeone suggested, because of something going on in the kids&#39; lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think that when the family is home as much as we are, it&#39;s easy to <br/>\nslip into rudeness. But it is also imperative that we treat each other with <br/>\nrespect. Otherwise, I do start getting sick of having them around and can <br/>\nfully understand why some people say &quot;I couldn&#39;t stand to have them home all <br/>\nday.&quot; Because sometimes I can&#39;t stand it either!<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11649,"nextTopicId":11654}}
