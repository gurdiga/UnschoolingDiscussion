This is exactly the example I used awhile back in my argument FOR<br/>\ncontrolling the content of my kids&#39; television shows.  After considering<br/>\nwhat Sandra and other posters stated, I realized that my 8yo has no interest<br/>\nin Howard Stern, is not even interested in anything along that line.  If he<br/>\ndid watch the show, it would just to be with me while I watched it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you really envision your 6yo walking into the den, turning on the tv,<br/>\nflipping past shows on army guys, snakes, construction, Spongebob, etc., and<br/>\ntuning in to E! and naked ladies?<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue story....last night 8yo said he wanted to watch a show called &quot;The<br/>\nscariest places&quot; or some such thing.  I told him that I didn&#39;t think he<br/>\nwould like it because it is really scary.  He started to argue and I backed<br/>\noff.  He wanted to put the show on timer which makes it difficult to change<br/>\nchannels.  I asked him not to so he could change channels if he became<br/>\nfrightened.  He watched less than 2 minutes of the show, deciding for<br/>\nhimself that it was too intense for him.  If I had made the decision, I<br/>\nwould have robbed Zach of that knowledge of himself and his environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my .02<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24754,"nextTopicId":24762}}
