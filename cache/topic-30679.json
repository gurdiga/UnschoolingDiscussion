It&#39;s not about them having complete power in all<br/>\ndecisions...that would be overwhelming for a child.<br/>\n    I think that those more likely to &quot;stay out late,  partying and<br/>\nexperimenting with sex,  drugs, rock-n-roll ;-)  are those who are<br/>\ndisassociated  in their relationships with their parents.
