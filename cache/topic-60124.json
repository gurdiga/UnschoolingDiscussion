It is hard if you did not start with that philosophy from the <br/>\nstart.  If you did, then the children first learned by seeing you do it, <br/>\nlater by doing it too.  They get the idea that it is a &quot;particip-action&quot; <br/>\nthing.  It is not so much a chore as part of living. By now my 16 years <br/>\nold can do anything &quot;housework&quot; including some home maintenance and <br/>\nmaintenance of the family vehicles. They have their own accounts and <br/>\nbudget.  They have enough life skills to take care of themselves.<br/>\nLucie<br/>\nmcole_1305 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I just guess I have to disagree on some points.  I see unschooling as <br/>\n&gt;learning from life.  Life may mean some things that have to get <br/>\n&gt;done.  We have to wash dishes or we dont have anything to eat off of, <br/>\n&gt;or to cook with. We have to change the oil in the car or it wont go. <br/>\n&gt;We have to wash clothes, or we will all have to go naked.  (Nobody <br/>\n&gt;wants that).  I also believe that by teaching my sons these life <br/>\n&gt;tasks they are learning things that will benefit them.  I teach them <br/>\n&gt;to cook, to keep the house decent, to do their laundry, to balance a <br/>\n&gt;checkbook, ect.  Is this not unschooling?  I have to say that it is.  <br/>\n&gt;It is general responsibility and though I do agree that they get to <br/>\n&gt;choose and their day is centered around that, they must also learn <br/>\n&gt;that some things just have to happen in life.  I would be <br/>\n&gt;irresponsible as a parent if I didnt teach them what it took to <br/>\n&gt;live.  To pay bills and to take care of what it takes to take care of <br/>\n&gt;their families if and when they have them.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Melissa<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60157,"nextTopicId":60176}}
