I thought,  when I ordered the book,  that this was just like the old one, but with some comments by Farenga.   There is also some updated statistics and such;  and more homeschooling resources.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just started reading it.   I&#39;ll let you all know what its like when I&#39;ve gotten into it more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will also be able to do a good comparison of unschooling SC-style and Farenga this August.   He&#39;s the keynote speaker at the Minnesota Homeschooling Conference,  which happens to be two weekends after SC.   I&#39;ll be going to both, so it will be interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, May 30, 2003 4:20 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Schedules and classes...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 5/30/03 7:45:28 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HMSL2@...\">HMSL2@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; Pat Farenga is the author of The Beginner&#39;s Guide to Homeschooling <br/>\n<br/>\n  (Holt Associates, 1999) and Teach Your Own: The John Holt Book of <br/>\n<br/>\n  Homeschooling (Perseus, 2003).
