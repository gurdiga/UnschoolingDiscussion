Can&#39;t recall the author,<br/>\nshe also has a book The Dance of Intimacy (haven&#39;t read it yet).  I had The<br/>\nDance of Anger recommended on another hs list.  I checked it out of the<br/>\nlibrary and ended up keeping it an extra 2 weeks in order to read it again.<br/>\nI will probably go buy a personal copy.  It really opened my eyes to how my<br/>\nproblems with my mother had really tainted my relationship with my children.<br/>\nEven though I still haven&#39;t directly talked with my mother (haven&#39;t spoken<br/>\nto her in 3 years and may still not) , I still have done a lot of internal<br/>\nwork on the relationship and understanding.  I can see a direct improvement<br/>\nin my handling my relationships with my children.  Hubby & I were able to<br/>\ndiscuss a lot of things about how we handle things in our marriage and<br/>\nopenly look at some areas that have been uncomfortable for us but off limits<br/>\nfor discussion.  I can&#39;t recommend this book enough.  It was truly a life<br/>\nchanging read for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nLiz</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3359,"nextTopicId":3525}}
