When I or someone else says, &quot;I need to do<br/>\nsomething because TV seems to be having very destructive effects on my<br/>\nchild.&quot;  Many of you answer as if we said, &quot;TV watching is bad for<br/>\nchildren.&quot;  (The quote I included with my post is what caused the thought<br/>\nto gel - I saw the words &quot;our children&quot; and realized that some of you<br/>\ndiscuss these things as if there is a sameness to our children.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t come to the conclusion that I need to limit my son&#39;s TV because<br/>\nI read studies about Alpha Waves - I haven&#39;t looked at them.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\nmake decisions based on a book by a child psychologist (or several books)<br/>\n- I don&#39;t read them.  I didn&#39;t make the decision based on what I think<br/>\nother parents around me were doing - peer pressure never was an issue for<br/>\nme.   I saw a problem in my family, analyzed it, discovered it stemmed<br/>\nfrom obsessive TV watching and I did something about it.  I don&#39;t believe<br/>\nPokemon is evil, I don&#39;t think you should have to limit YOUR child<br/>\nbecause of an effect on mine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do think though, that I may have something to offer to another mom who<br/>\nsays, &quot;My son gets violent when he watches TV all day.&quot;  And my advice is<br/>\nnot going to be turn it off entirely.  It may help others to know they<br/>\nare not alone.  I can offer anecdotal evidence of how I handled it with a<br/>\ncaution that her experience may vary.  I can offer my support in whatever<br/>\nshe decides about the issue.  But, what I won&#39;t do, is criticize her<br/>\nthought that maybe the TV is bad for her son - because only she is there.<br/>\n Only she really sees if there is a cause and effect.  It would be<br/>\narrogant of any of us to assume she is less able to judge the situation<br/>\nthan we are.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Standing by and watching our children &quot;waste&quot; their time with <br/>\n&gt; activity that we perceive/know will lead to negative outcomes is as <br/>\n&gt; difficult with grown children/people as it is with young ones who we <br/>\n&gt; have &quot;control&quot; over. The difference is that an older child/person <br/>\n&gt; might, at some point, insist on their autonomy being respected and <br/>\n&gt; will spend their time with those they perceive as respecting them. <br/>\n&gt; The little ones feel shame and anger but it takes them sometime to <br/>\n&gt; learn what to do with it.  They are totally dependent on our <br/>\n&gt; benevolence and they know it. I&#39;ve see the fear in my children&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; eyes more times than I&#39;d like to admit. They don&#39;t know what a <br/>\n&gt; parents love feels like, they truly fear that my feelings could <br/>\n&gt; change and I might reject them. I nursed them all until they were 4 <br/>\n&gt; or 5, they sleep with us in our family bed until they decide they <br/>\n&gt; want more privacy, we remind them that their home is with us and for <br/>\n&gt; as long as we&#39;re alive we&#39;ll share all that we have, and still, I <br/>\n&gt; see that fear in their innocent faces when I push them or show them <br/>\n&gt; my disapproval. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\n     In three words I can sum up everything I&#39;ve learned about life: it<br/>\ngoes on.<br/>\n                                                     - Robert Frost</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bridget E Coffman","from":"Bridget E Coffman &lt;rumpleteasermom@...&gt;","profile":"rumpleteasermom","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"FK5KU3x_BYzVhKfkFM2mxK9C1kUxv2xSZriXziRP6DjTCREcLonpwsRbGHFShVtp8iPev-wUsFvJIUCORmRt1npNnZHZ-F60EksTlXa4gcygjpE","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] TV Thread","postDate":"1005486086","msgId":27567,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDExMTExLjEwMDMxMy4tNzI3ODc3LjMucnVtcGxldGVhc2VybW9tQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":27568,"prevInTime":27566,"nextInTime":27568,"topicId":27567,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
