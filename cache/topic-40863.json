At the end of the year,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you have to hand in a portfolio with samples of the student&#39;s work,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; along with a letter from a qualified evaluator stating that progress<br/>\n&gt;&gt; has been made.  If the school district doesn&#39;t like it they can<br/>\n&gt;&gt; initiate due process and ask for a more proof that education has<br/>\n&gt;&gt; occured.  So imagine you unschool and don&#39;t have workbook pages to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; hand in.  You could hand in some brochures of places you&#39;ve been,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; maybe photocopy a penpal letter your child writes, and if you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;&gt; luckky, you&#39;ll find a mathmania or puzzlemania book they&#39;ve done.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Keep in mind you&#39;ll be handing this portfolio in next to total school<br/>\n&gt;&gt; at homers who will hand in thick scrapbooks filled with all kinds of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; things that will impress school officials.
