I live in a windy area in the SF East Bay.  Where are you?  Do<br/>\nyou want to rattle this list and see if you can shake out more<br/>\nunschoolers near you?<br/>\nBetsy****<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Betsy,<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Soorshian (sorry for the spelling Pam) hooked me up with some<br/>\nunschoolers about 1/2 and hour from us.  But in my town (which is small)<br/>\nI can find no others and I have looked.  So, while it&#39;s nice to have<br/>\nsome within 1/2 an hour from us (who already know each other and I&#39;m<br/>\nshy, but trying to make friends ;-) ), it would also be nice to have<br/>\nsome in town.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids were born in the North Bay (Santa Rosa) and I miss the<br/>\natmosphere up there.  I don&#39;t however miss the traffic.  The town that<br/>\nI&#39;m in is on the ocean between Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo, it&#39;s<br/>\nwindy here most of the time.  Any one else in Lompoc?<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\nin sunny, windy, beautiful Lompoc, CA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68702,"nextTopicId":68648}}
