Geez, its been so long since I thought of it<br/>\nas anything but the UC.  It was started after a big war on the UL<br/>\n(Unschoolers List) and some members were kicked off and others were told to<br/>\nshut up (UL is moderated).  At first it was more a sounding board for a<br/>\nparticular couple of folks who are/were rabid unschoolers!  And I mean<br/>\nRABID!!!  There way or no way or you weren&#39;t an unschooler.  Then about 6<br/>\nmonths ago it blew up with one list members boyfriend coming on as a troll<br/>\nand then another list member going balistic because he didn&#39;t believe in<br/>\nmedication of any sort and then wanted another list members hubby (a<br/>\ndoctor) to do online prescribing for the teenage girl he married (he&#39;s 40).<br/>\n The feathers, fur and just about everything else hit the fan.  Two other<br/>\nlists were off shots of the UC, SO (Schools Out) and NC (No Class, as in no<br/>\nclasses).  Then NC blew up because of off list posting and parties that<br/>\nlive in LaLa Land.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there you have the UC, which is really quiet right now, saga.
