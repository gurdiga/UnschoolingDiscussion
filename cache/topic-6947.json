I noticed <br/>\na response to someone who lives in Oklahoma.  I&#39;m also in OK and would love <br/>\nto chat with any unschoolers here.  We&#39;re new homeschoolers (this is our <br/>\nsecond year) and we&#39;re most definitely leaning toward unschooling, although <br/>\nto tell you the truth we&#39;ve basically been unschooling from the start, I just <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know that I didn&#39;t have to feel guilty about it.  I&#39;m still a little <br/>\nnervous, but I do think &quot;talking&quot; to others who have chosen a similiar path <br/>\nwill help calm my fears.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way...my kids are 12, 9, 5 and 1.  I had the first one at 23 and the <br/>\nfourth one at 34.  My fourth child was injured at birth (she has a brachial <br/>\nplexus injury) so I have to say that the past year has been a challenging <br/>\none.  Still, in some ways it&#39;s easier for me to be a mother now than it was <br/>\n12 years ago.  Of course there are other things that were easier when I was <br/>\n23, but mostly they&#39;re physical things.  Every child is different, so there&#39;s <br/>\nsomething else to figure in.  I think the kind of mother a woman is has very <br/>\nlittle to do with age, and lots to do with maturity, understanding, wisdom, <br/>\nand experience (not necessarily with kids, although that kind is helpful, but <br/>\nthe experiences we&#39;ve had in life in general).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe baby&#39;s crying - gotta go.  Nice to &quot;meet&quot; you all.<br/>\n<br/>\nJodye</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6943,"nextTopicId":6949}}
