I haven&#39;t meet a <br/>\nchild that does not enjoy recieving mail.  I figure this would be a <br/>\nfun way to teach them geograpy.  I have only contacted a few <br/>\nunschooling groups so far, but I am hoping to contact all 5o states.  <br/>\nPlease come and participate.  There are other mail exchange groups <br/>\nthat cost money this will only cost a post card and postage and <br/>\nlittle bit of your child&#39;s time to say hello Im am in which ever <br/>\nstate he or she is from.  This will be fun for all ages ( including <br/>\nthe 2 and 3 yeard olds.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you <br/>\nHazel<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MailExchange/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MailExchange/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32279,"nextTopicId":32433}}
