I do find that legos go in phases around here.  Sometimes they re very, very popular and every set is built and played with.

Our 7 yr old going on 8 girls  asked for Lego for Xmas and<br/>\n&gt; got a tub of assorted  pieces  from a cousin. two base plates and three Harry<br/>\n&gt; Potter small sets from us.  Have not played with it  a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do find that legos go in phases around here.  Sometimes they&#39;re very, very<br/>\npopular and every set is built and played with.  Sometimes they collect<br/>\ndust.  You have a nice combination started; my son likes sets because<br/>\nthey&#39;re really cool, but seperate pieces to build the stuff the sets<br/>\n&quot;forgot&quot;.  (Extra castles for the bad guys, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDo your daughters need someone to play with them?  Sometimes I have helped<br/>\nTim get going on a story idea, and then been told to go away for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; what  is available that would add interest for them?<br/>\n&gt; Someone mentioned Lego magazines?  Anything else out there?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Go to the lego website (lego.com, I think) and look around.  Lego magazine<br/>\nis free and full story lines, ideas of things you can build, pictures of<br/>\nthings other kids have built, etc.  Lego shop-at-home comes with a catalogue<br/>\nof all sorts of stuff, or just go to the toy store and see what suits their<br/>\ninterests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They are building right now but  usually<br/>\n&gt; abandon it in favor of &quot;ready to go&quot; characters. Do most boys like the<br/>\n&gt; building part more than the  &quot;story making part&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not my boy.  He has times when he really wants to build, and then he sorts<br/>\npieces and builds every set he owns.  (That&#39;s about a three-day project<br/>\naround here.  We must have a couple million lego pieces.  Maybe we&#39;ll count<br/>\nsomeday...)  But most of the time, Tim is in there with the knights and his<br/>\ntwo castles (neither from sets, just ones he and his dad built) and the<br/>\nknights fight, the princess does magic, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the great things you can get from the Lego shop-at-home folks is sets<br/>\nof &quot;extras&quot;.  There&#39;s a set of about 30 people, supposedly townfolk.  There<br/>\nare sets of swords and shields, sets of hats and extra hair, etc.  Those are<br/>\ninexpensive ways to really expand your play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the big sets are fun but expensive, and mainly for lots of bricks,<br/>\nbaseplates, etc.  The little sets often include people and &quot;extras&quot; like a<br/>\nhorse, accessories, etc. that are more fun to make up stories with, at least<br/>\nfor my son.  <br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69240,"nextTopicId":69482}}
