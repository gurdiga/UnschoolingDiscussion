Thanks.<br/>\n     As far as getting him to a state conference, the only one I know for <br/>\nIndiana is the Christian conference in Indianapolis.  He agreed to go, if I <br/>\nwant him to, but it is very school-at-home oriented.  The speakers and <br/>\neverything tend to be people from that mindset.  So I don&#39;t think it will do <br/>\nany good.  <br/>\n      The only unschooling conferences that I can find seem to be very far <br/>\naway.  I haven&#39;t found one close enough yet.  My husband doesn&#39;t want to <br/>\ndrive over 8 hours to go to a 2 day conference.  Neither one of us has ever <br/>\nflown (not sure we can afford it), although we both agreed the other day that <br/>\nwe would love to do so sometime.<br/>\n      Also, as far as getting him around other local unschoolers like you <br/>\nmentioned, I haven&#39;t found any in my area at all.  I have been looking for <br/>\neight years!  Of course, there may be some hiding in the woodwork (since this <br/>\narea is so condemning of unschoolers).  I have no idea how to find them <br/>\nthough  :-(<br/>\nTammy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; think there was a thread a while back about reluctant husbands, you might <br/>\n&gt; want to look in the archives for good ideas.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband was really nervous at first, but we have always had a good <br/>\n&gt; dialogue about everything.  I kept giving him little things to read, but he <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t get around to them.  (In his defense, he had a very busy full time <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; engineering job and then is a musicologist on the side.)  Our local hs <br/>\n&gt; group <br/>\n&gt; was having an open house and I had planned on going alone.  At the last <br/>\n&gt; minute (literally during dinner) I decided we all should go.  Lots of <br/>\n&gt; grumpiness all around, but it worked.  He met the children and the parents <br/>\n&gt; and realized how much better a life our kids would have by not going to <br/>\n&gt; school.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That hurdle being crossed, we both attended a state conference last March.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; His eyes and mind were opened to unschooling and has embraced it with a <br/>\n&gt; passion matching his passion for orchestral music!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I highly recommend you get him to a group of unschooling children and <br/>\n&gt; parents.  Seeing is believing.  Of course, this only works if he has a good <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; example of school kids to contrast the unschooling kids to.  We have nieces <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and nephews and a block with 38 kids.  Lots of comparisons.  Our kids are <br/>\n&gt; young and we had witnessed three nephews completely change personalities <br/>\n&gt; once <br/>\n&gt; they went to preschool.

My 12 yo <br/>\ndd was in a community theatre production this past weekend of The Wizard <br/>\nof Oz. There were three other homeschooling families in addition to ours <br/>\nrepresented in the production - one teen, one family of three children, <br/>\nand the Wicked Witch herself is a homeschooling mom. At the cast party, <br/>\nI overheard the mom of the three kids talking about homeschooling so I <br/>\njoined the discussion. My friend is a (recently) former fund. xtian, and <br/>\nthey still use a very structured form of homeschooling, but no longer <br/>\ncons. xtian curriculum. Together, we were talking to two couples who <br/>\nwere interested in learning about homeschooling *because* of the kids - <br/>\nthey were so impressed by the kids, so stunned to learn that they <br/>\nhomeschool, that they wanted to learn more. Both my friend and I <br/>\npresented, together, why homeschooling was great, and how easy it is to <br/>\nfit it to your kids and your family - and our two families being very <br/>\ndifferent being a perfect example. One man was so impressed, that he <br/>\ncame and found us later to ask more questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to make a short story long, yes, seeing other kids and families is, <br/>\nimho, a great way to show that unschooling/homeschooling works.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thursday, November 7, 2002, at 08:55  AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ejcrewe@...\">ejcrewe@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I highly recommend you get him to a group of unschooling children and<br/>\n&gt; parents.  Seeing is believing.  Of course, this only works if he has a <br/>\n&gt; good<br/>\n&gt; example of school kids to contrast the unschooling kids to.  We have <br/>\n&gt; nieces<br/>\n&gt; and nephews and a block with 38 kids.  Lots of comparisons.  Our kids <br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; young and we had witnessed three nephews completely change <br/>\n&gt; personalities once<br/>\n&gt; they went to preschool.  Could be their personalities would have changed<br/>\n&gt; anyway, but I was unwilling to take the risk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Elizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":123374705,"authorName":"ejcrewe@aol.com","from":"ejcrewe@...","profile":"ejcrewe2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Intro and husband","postDate":"1036677352","msgId":49263,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3OS4xMTM1OGNjOC4yYWZiY2FlOEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":49269,"prevInTime":49262,"nextInTime":49264,"topicId":49263,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Tammy - I think there was a thread a while back about reluctant husbands, you might want to look in the archives for good ideas.

He met the children and the parents <br/>\nand realized how much better a life our kids would have by not going to <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat hurdle being crossed, we both attended a state conference last March.  <br/>\nHis eyes and mind were opened to unschooling and has embraced it with a <br/>\npassion matching his passion for orchestral music!<br/>\n<br/>\nI highly recommend you get him to a group of unschooling children and <br/>\nparents.
