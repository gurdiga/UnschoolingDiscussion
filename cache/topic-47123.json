Scientists have found a 77-million-year-old dinosaur so<br/>\nwell preserved<br/>\nthat they&#39;re calling it a &quot;mummy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the leathery skin on this creature, discovered two summers ago in<br/>\nMontana, is<br/>\nintact, though turned to mineral. Its throat and shoulder muscle are still<br/>\nthere. Its face retains<br/>\ntraces of its nail-like beak. Its discoverers even say it contains the<br/>\nremnants of its last meal,<br/>\na half-digested mass of plant material.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Once in a blue moon we have an opportunity to get greater insight into life&#39;s<br/>\nprehistory,&quot;<br/>\nsays Nate Murphy, curator of paleontology at the Phillips County Museum in<br/>\nMalta, Mont.,<br/>\nwhere the fossil is being studied. Murphy described the find this month at a<br/>\nnews conference<br/>\nin Norman, during the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology annual meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe creature was a duck-billed dinosaur known as Brachylophosaurus.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn life it would have been a two-legged, plant-eating animal that measured<br/>\nabout 20 feet (6.1<br/>\nmetres) long. It died while just three to four years old, and is the first<br/>\njuvenile of this species<br/>\never found, Murphy says.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe young Brachylophosaurus may have died in an isolated place such as on a<br/>\nsandbar,<br/>\nthen dried out before becoming buried by sand, Murphy speculates. That could<br/>\nhave allowed<br/>\nthe dinosaur to fossilise with much of its muscle and other tissue intact.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaleontologists occasionally find pieces of dinosaur-skin impressions, or<br/>\nother soft tissue,<br/>\nbut usually such features are lost when the dinosaur turns to stone.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;All too rarely do paleontologists find more than bones and teeth,&quot; says K.<br/>\nChristopher<br/>\nBeard, a paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, who was not<br/>\ninvolved in<br/>\nthe work.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften such discoveries are controversial. For instance, a North Carolina<br/>\ndinosaur, once<br/>\nthought to have a fossilised heart intact inside its rib cage, may contain<br/>\nnothing more than a<br/>\nrock.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, Murphy is confident that he has a scientific treasure.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly a few such well-preserved dinosaurs have been found before, he says. One<br/>\nis the<br/>\ndinosaur mummy discovered nearly a century ago that is at the American Museum<br/>\nof Natural<br/>\nHistory in New York. Another belongs to a natural history museum in Frankfurt,<br/>\nGermany.<br/>\n<br/>\nA third dinosaur mummy was found in Alberta, Canada, but was sunk by the<br/>\nGermans during<br/>\nWorld War I as it was being shipped to the British Museum, Murphy says.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn amateur fossil hunter discovered the new specimen during an expedition to<br/>\nMontana&#39;s<br/>\nLower Judith River Formation in July 2000. Team leaders nicknamed the dinosaur<br/>\nLeonardo,<br/>\nafter one of a pair of lovers&#39; names found scrawled nearby with the date 1916,<br/>\nsays team<br/>\nmember Mark Thompson.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 2001, the excavators removed the fossil in a single six-tonne block, trying<br/>\nto preserve as<br/>\nmuch as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalling it a mummy is a bit misleading, Murphy says.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike Egyptian human mummies, which were elaborately prepared after death,<br/>\nthe dinosaur<br/>\nunderwent a rare series of natural circumstances to keep it preserved.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe team plans to study what allowed the fossil to stay so intact.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47096,"nextTopicId":47057}}
