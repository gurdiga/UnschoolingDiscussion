We have a lot of &quot;you&#39;re stuck<br/>\nwith us&quot; and &quot;yes I am your real mom, although I&#39;m not your birth mom&quot;<br/>\nmoments.  Puberty is coming on strong, and dh & I are both having<br/>\nsignificant health things at the moment...  Change - and potential<br/>\nchange - can be hard for some of us to live with.<br/>\n<br/>\nYoungest, and only still at home, child is the only one of our  4 who&#39;s<br/>\nnever gone to school.  She&#39;s 10 now.  Her middle sibs left the system @<br/>\nmiddle school, the oldest went all the way through (OT/brushing helped<br/>\nhim!).  Oh, she did go to a &#39;therapeutic&#39; preschool part time for a<br/>\nwhile, I went with her at first -- the goal there was to help her<br/>\nlearn/experience that I interacted with her differently than the<br/>\nteachers did, and that I also interacted with her differently than I did<br/>\nwith the other kids.  Eventually I started leaving her there (at first<br/>\njust going to another room for a few minutes), so she could grow an<br/>\nunderstanding that I could be out of sight and she could know where was,<br/>\nand that I would come back.  &lt;sigh&gt;  She joined us before she was 2, we<br/>\ndon&#39;t know a lot about her time before that but we were at least family<br/>\n#6 for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat an adventure life is!
