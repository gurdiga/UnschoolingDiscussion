In the late 19th/early 20th century, &quot;The<br/>\nJournal of John Woolman&quot; was considered such essential reading for<br/>\nunderstanding American history that it was the first book (along with<br/>\nBen Franklin&#39;s Diary) to be published in the Harvard Classics Series.<br/>\nHistory was NOT always taught as a series of names of generals, battles,<br/>\nand dates, and because of the journal nature of Woolman&#39;s work, it<br/>\nprovides a perfect take-off point for dialogue about values as they<br/>\npertained to pre-Revolutionary America.  I highly recommend it -- not so<br/>\nmuch for kids (though of course if they express interest, go for it!)<br/>\nbut for parents trying to re-energize interest in history for<br/>\nthemselves!<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________<br/>\nMy book &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me: Adventures in Homeschooling and<br/>\nCommunity-Based Education&quot; will be off the press around September 20.<br/>\nTo read a sample chapter, reviewers&#39; comments, or the foreword, visit my<br/>\nwebsite at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.skylarksings.com\">http://www.skylarksings.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Pokerdog70@aol.com","from":"Pokerdog70@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"35m7lC8VzOg62DuPEeo3pKL3QN_I8GREdZ7UhOsQ5pUgacUk6ag-VpNsJ0rFcM0HQfB-Q0EqJrCm","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Religion and homeschooling","postDate":"937059946","msgId":2883,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMDIuMjg4My45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2886,"prevInTime":2882,"nextInTime":2884,"topicId":2883,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"David, I LOVED your comments and thoughts on religion and homeschooling.
