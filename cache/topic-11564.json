Think \n  about it. When you make a mistake and someone comes up to you and starts \n  hitting you or yelling at you or screaming at you how do you feel/like it. \n  When it comes to disaplining my 3.5 and 5.5yo I try to keep this in mind. \n  However, I also don&#39;t let them go on making the same mistake. I will sit down \n  with them at first and explain that their behavior is inapproriate and why and \n  that I don&#39;t want to see/hear it again. The next time it happens I will repeat \n  the previous discussion and tell them what will happen if it they continue \n  with the behaviour. If it continues, and I usually give thema&nbsp; few mor \n  chances of reminding depending on the child and situation, then they will \n  receive something strict like having a toy or&nbsp; activity removed. \n  Eventually, I end up sending them to their room. and Very few times I have \n  done to the child what it was that they did to the other person. I did this \n  the other&nbsp; day with 5.5yo when he hit his 3.5yo sister with a stick that \n  1&quot; in diamiter and 4&#39; long. Hitting with sticks is absolutely not allowed and \n  he knows this and it is something that he repeats periodicly. I had DD get me \n  the stick he hit her with and then used it to spank his hiney. I didn&#39;t hit \n  him as hard as I thought he should have been because of the size of the stick \n  but after I used the stick I used my bare hand abt3 times so he did feel that. \n  Then I sent him to his room. I also told him that if it happens again I will \n  get a stick myself and it will be tiny round one that will hurt his hiney. \n  That is the first time I have used anything other than my hand to spank...and \n  I only use spanking as a last resort. MIL and SIL tell me all the time that I \n  am doing a good job with them because when the kids spend time over there they \n  are always very well behaved and polite. They say that is the true test...how \n  they behave when mom and dad are not around.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, hope this \n  helps.

If children <br/>\nknow we respect them and their needs, they are much more likely to respect <br/>\nother people and their needs.  Too often children are seen as a nuisance <br/>\nrather than a treasure (IMHO).  How often do we hear from other parents &#39;oh, <br/>\nI could never stand to have my child at home all day.  How do you do you do <br/>\nthat?&#39;  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, if I had to give only one reason I homeschool this would be it...I <br/>\nlike my kids and I&#39;m selfish enough to want them around all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t an answer to why it sets parents off...it does seem to be a rather <br/>\nuniversal reaction (or at least almost universal).  To me that begs the <br/>\nquestion what is &#39;sass&#39;?  I simply won&#39;t tolerate rudeness in my home.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t give rudeness and I won&#39;t allow anyone else to be rude either.   Any <br/>\nfamily member is free to speak their honest opinion and let us know what&#39;s <br/>\ngoing on or problems they may have.  Everyone has had to learn how to state <br/>\ntheir opinion in polite ways.  Sad to admit it, but mom had to be the first <br/>\nto learn!  (I used to be a screamer...hated what it did to me and my family.  <br/>\nLearned not to do that AND not to just hold in negative feelings.  Best thing <br/>\nI ever learned and I have worked to pass it on to my family.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to go with natural consequences.  I don&#39;t think some things should wait <br/>\nlong enough for natural consequences to make a difference.  Manners can be <br/>\none of those things.  If a child takes years &#39;learning&#39; that no one likes <br/>\nhim, he may never figure out that it&#39;s because he is rude.  In that case he&#39;s <br/>\nmissed the lesson, learned negative thinking and I&#39;ve allowed a lot of harm <br/>\nto come to this little person I&#39;m responsible to/for.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 cents worth,<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"AmyKCA@aol.com","from":"AmyKCA@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Hx8bHi_L3RuVwcGlNzw14PdhaA5XYWkct1aAt--__hv1sNNyC6SIKvh9jXDfDhlkXqgNoog","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] sassy kids","postDate":"964926775","msgId":11615,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk3LjhjYzMwNjUuMjZiNGY3MzdAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":11614,"nextInTopic":11619,"prevInTime":11614,"nextInTime":11616,"topicId":11564,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would also like to suggest something...

I heard everything from &quot;he&#39;s just <br/>\ndoing normal boy things&quot; to &quot;you should think about putting him on Ritalin&quot;.  <br/>\nHe was losing friends, and was not always welcome at everyone&#39;s home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne day while I was in the book store, I came across this book called &quot;Living <br/>\nwith the Active/Alert Child&quot; by  Linda S. Budd, Ph.D.  The first sentence, in <br/>\nthe first chapter said &quot;did you put on your running shoes when your child was <br/>\nborn, and have worn out several pairs since?&quot;  This sentence stopped me dead <br/>\nin my tracks and I thought &quot;yeah! yeah, I have!&quot;  This book went on to <br/>\ndescribe a child who either required little sleep, or had a hard time falling <br/>\nasleep.  A child who seem to get more active or frantic as the day wore on, <br/>\nand much more.  Well, I bought that book and it has saved our lives!  My <br/>\nchild is now cooperating, and becoming better and better at getting along <br/>\nwith others.  I sometimes feel so bad, because I did not understand him, and <br/>\nliterally took the wrong road as far as discipline, but now things are so <br/>\nmuch better.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 11 traits to an active/alert child:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.

I<br/>\n&gt; also know that my children typically don&#39;t sass anyone but me and my<br/>\n&gt; husband, so imo I&#39;ve been &quot;successful&quot; in teaching htem that it is an<br/>\n&gt; inappropriate behavior.  I also know that most of their interactions with<br/>\n&gt; me aren&#39;t sassy (although there are days....) and most of the time it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; related to other things going on with them....hungry, tired, lonely,<br/>\n&gt; angry, frustrated...and it&#39;s mostly impulse control on their part, because<br/>\n&gt; believe me, I really feel like being sassy with people quite<br/>\n&gt; frequently....like today when my bil was annoying me....but I&#39;ve learned<br/>\n&gt; control.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, my question is, why does this bother us so much?  I suspect it is<br/>\n&gt; because so many of us were not validated as children ourselves so we are<br/>\n&gt; unable to see sassiness as a symptom and not as the problem itself.  And<br/>\n&gt; my second question is why do we feel a need to punish our children for<br/>\n&gt; being sassy (because let&#39;s face it, no matter how much we warn, count and<br/>\n&gt; be calm about taking away the nintendo, it&#39;s not a true consequence of<br/>\n&gt; their sassiness--it&#39;s a punishment)?  I know I do.  I want to say, &quot;That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; it!  No Pokemon movie because I&#39;m tired of your snapping at me&quot;.  But what<br/>\n&gt; does that teach my son?  When people annoy him through their behaior to<br/>\n&gt; make them miserable.  It&#39;s no different than when my mother wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &quot;hear&quot; me when I was whining as a child.  &quot;I can&#39;t hear you when you use<br/>\n&gt; that tone.&quot;  Uh, mom?  If you know what tone I&#39;m using, then you can hear<br/>\n&gt; me, %^%$##!  Oh wait, that&#39;s sassy;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, maybe I want to react in these ways because that is how I was treated?<br/>\n&gt; I would never treat my husband that way on the occassions he gest &quot;sassy&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and I know that the &quot;words&quot; he and I had yesterday in a bad moment would<br/>\n&gt; qualify as &quot;sassy&quot; but I&#39;d just get angrier if he took away my email<br/>\n&gt; privileges for a day or didn&#39;t let me go to the fair this week...instead,<br/>\n&gt; what I appreciate when I&#39;m out of sorts and being disrespectful myself is<br/>\n&gt; kindness and gentleness and quality attention.  Why then do we think<br/>\n&gt; children deserve less?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I *wasn&#39;t* allowed to sass at all when I was a child.  And that behavior,<br/>\n&gt; along with some others, are real triggers for me as an adult.  They can<br/>\n&gt; j8ust send me off the deep end.  And I don&#39;t like that feeling.

I<br/>\nalso know that my children typically don&#39;t sass anyone but me and my<br/>\nhusband, so imo I&#39;ve been &quot;successful&quot; in teaching htem that it is an<br/>\ninappropriate behavior.  I also know that most of their interactions with<br/>\nme aren&#39;t sassy (although there are days....) and most of the time it&#39;s<br/>\nrelated to other things going on with them....hungry, tired, lonely,<br/>\nangry, frustrated...and it&#39;s mostly impulse control on their part, because<br/>\nbelieve me, I really feel like being sassy with people quite<br/>\nfrequently....like today when my bil was annoying me....but I&#39;ve learned<br/>\ncontrol.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my question is, why does this bother us so much?  I suspect it is<br/>\nbecause so many of us were not validated as children ourselves so we are<br/>\nunable to see sassiness as a symptom and not as the problem itself.  And<br/>\nmy second question is why do we feel a need to punish our children for<br/>\nbeing sassy (because let&#39;s face it, no matter how much we warn, count and<br/>\nbe calm about taking away the nintendo, it&#39;s not a true consequence of<br/>\ntheir sassiness--it&#39;s a punishment)?  I know I do.  I want to say, &quot;That&#39;s<br/>\nit!  No Pokemon movie because I&#39;m tired of your snapping at me&quot;.  But what<br/>\ndoes that teach my son?  When people annoy him through their behaior to<br/>\nmake them miserable.  It&#39;s no different than when my mother wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&quot;hear&quot; me when I was whining as a child.  &quot;I can&#39;t hear you when you use<br/>\nthat tone.&quot;  Uh, mom?  If you know what tone I&#39;m using, then you can hear<br/>\nme, %^%$##!  Oh wait, that&#39;s sassy;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, maybe I want to react in these ways because that is how I was treated?<br/>\nI would never treat my husband that way on the occassions he gest &quot;sassy&quot;<br/>\nand I know that the &quot;words&quot; he and I had yesterday in a bad moment would<br/>\nqualify as &quot;sassy&quot; but I&#39;d just get angrier if he took away my email<br/>\nprivileges for a day or didn&#39;t let me go to the fair this week...instead,<br/>\nwhat I appreciate when I&#39;m out of sorts and being disrespectful myself is<br/>\nkindness and gentleness and quality attention.  Why then do we think<br/>\nchildren deserve less?<br/>\n<br/>\nI *wasn&#39;t* allowed to sass at all when I was a child.  And that behavior,<br/>\nalong with some others, are real triggers for me as an adult.  They can<br/>\nj8ust send me off the deep end.  And I don&#39;t like that feeling.

That means you<br/>\nare an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; adult, by definition, at least.  &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I took a parenting class way back when my kid was about that age (almost<br/>\n15<br/>\n&gt; &gt; years ago!).  The most profound thing I heard in the whole 6 or 8 week<br/>\nclass<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was a mom talking about how frustrated she would get with her 5 yr old<br/>\nwhen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he would totally refuse to be cooperative and was generally rude and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; obnoxious and here she was trying her darnedest to be nice to the kid,<br/>\n(say<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nothing of avoiding a felonious act, ie murder!).  Anyway, she said she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; finally figured it out:  if she (or DH) reacted to the child in like<br/>\nmanner<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (yelling, being mad, etc.) there were suddenly twice as many 5 yr olds<br/>\nin the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; house!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, &#39;I&#39;m the mom&#39; means don&#39;t react like a 5/7/3 yr old, no matter how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tempting it may be.  Stick to your guns as nicely as possible, but don&#39;t<br/>\nbe a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doormat.  (nothing new here, huh?  You already know all this, don&#39;t you?<br/>\nWe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all do and we all get frustrated in the heat of the battle.  Don&#39;t let<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; throw you.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The second most important thing I learned from that parenting class is<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sooner or later your child is going to want something from you.  If<br/>\nhe/she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; learns that they are NOT going to get what they want by being rude or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; breaking the rules, you will eventually have a bargaining chip.<br/>\nSometimes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you really have to wait and watch to find something that works.  In this<br/>\ncase<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an example might be to refuse to get food while the child is demanding<br/>\nit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (if that leaves you feeling guilty, have something available he can get<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; himself...a cup of yogurt, slices of cheese, grapes, etc...and calmly<br/>\nsay the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;fill in the blanks&gt; are in the fridge, help yourself).  Won&#39;t take long<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he&#39;ll get the idea.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Can&#39;t tackle every issue at the same time, though.  Pick your battles if<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Having given this very sage advice (LOL...it&#39;s really too bad you can&#39;t<br/>\nsee<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my own family to know how totally ridiculous it is for me to claim<br/>\nwisdom!),<br/>\n&gt; &gt; first take a gut level assessment of things at home/in your life and<br/>\nkidlet&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lives.  Is there any turmoil going on?  Anyone teething?  Schedule off?<br/>\nMom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or dad busier than usual?  Missing out on bedtime stories/prayers/bath<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other rituals?  Getting enough sleep?  Enough down time?  Take the kids<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the park lately?  Played Legos?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think that most of the time when kids are acting up suddenly, it is<br/>\neither<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a growing stage where they are trying to find their place in the world<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there is something out of place in their lives.  My experience is that<br/>\nit can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; often be something that seems to be nothing out of the ordinary to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; adults.  But, think about it, we have so much more life experience.  We<br/>\nknow<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from our own experience that teething, for instance, really doesn&#39;t go<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forever...the sore mouth will go away.  But little people just don&#39;t<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that frame of reference to yet.  They can&#39;t think past the moment.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Having said all this...the best advice I&#39;ve seen yet was the one about<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bubble bath!  Make sure you get some time to be an adult.  A chance to<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; &gt; conversations with other adults about adult things might be nice.  How<br/>\nlong<br/>\n&gt; &gt; since you and DH have been on a date?  (making an assumption here that<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are married, based on age of kids)  When was the last time you went to a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grown up movie?  (pokemon does NOT count!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;ll pass.  Good luck.  I agree with the post that you are a good mom<br/>\nand it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is apparent because you care enough to seek solutions.   I&#39;m confident<br/>\nyou&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; &gt; keep looking until you find something that fits.  Sometimes that&#39;s the<br/>\nmost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; important skill...tenacity to hang tough and find answers or wait out<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; storm.  (of course, as soon as you figure out how to play the game, the<br/>\nkids<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will change the rules and you get to start all over again!  bg)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Eiraul<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"M & J Welch","from":"&quot;M & J Welch&quot; &lt;seamus@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"cbTN4jwIGiz_kDmbSdlgP8T0TDxCDf-ct3CSQNqM5HIsXvDjabNFMO1ddyP2nOlJ-6NXf4tJ-UwwhLDJmcC5n43dcvbRv3msATHGK_g","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Get those Unschooling Minds to Work! :-)","postDate":"964883007","msgId":11591,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PExQQkJJTURNUEdKQU9MS0JKSUlFQUVCR0NDQUEuc2VhbXVzQHBvcnR1cC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PExBVzItRjEzOXZDM3hLdU1WYTkwMDAwNjdkZkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":11590,"nextInTopic":11605,"prevInTime":11590,"nextInTime":11592,"topicId":11564,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This summer I ve been experimenting with unschooling.

My oldest has tried some sassiness, too.  When it occurs, I stop <br/>\nwhatever it is I am doing, to help stress my seriousness, look him in the <br/>\neye, and point to &quot;the time- out &quot; chair.  If I start walking toward him as I <br/>\nsay, &quot;in the chair&quot;, he moves there very quickly.Once in the chair I tell him <br/>\nvery firmly that  I do NOT tolerate any smart-mouthed talk, and if  he <br/>\nchooses to speak rudely and ugly to me, then he is also choosing to sit by <br/>\nhimself, because I am not going to listen to it.    It doesn&#39;t take too long <br/>\nfor him to change his attitude, and he usually apologizes soon after.    <br/>\nSometimes he says, &quot;I&#39;ll be good now, can I get down?&quot;  Depending on the <br/>\nseriousness of the incident, I may deny  him some tv time, or playing with a <br/>\nparticular toy, or  friend for a while.    This does not make him happy, but <br/>\nmy point to him is that  he needs to choose polite behavior first, because it <br/>\nis the right thing to do, instead of thinking that if he says what he thinks <br/>\nI want to hear, then he will basically get off scot free.     Yesterday, he <br/>\nwas rushing around wanting to run out the door because a neighbor had come <br/>\nover.  I told him that I wanted him to put some shoes on first.  He acted <br/>\nlike he did not hear me,  and opened the door, so I repeated it.  He <br/>\nresponded with rolling his eyes, and saying &quot;OK! OK! OK!&quot;  as if I had nagged <br/>\nhim endlessly-, and began to stomp off down to his room. Immediately I told <br/>\nhim that he was &quot;in the chair&quot;, and in a huff he sat down.  After a few mins. <br/>\nhe asked if he could get down.  I told him all that he had to do in the first <br/>\nplace was just nicely say &quot;ok&quot;, and go put his shoes on, but he looked at me <br/>\nand shook his head no.  So, I told him that he could just sit there longer.   <br/>\n He sat there quietly and much more calmly.  After a few mins longer, he <br/>\nagain asked to get down.  I said that he could.  On his own, he went and put <br/>\non his shoes, and came back and apologized for his behavior.  We hugged and <br/>\nhe went on out to play.   Overall, I think kids get to where they test and <br/>\nretest our rules, and that it really is reassuring to them to know their <br/>\nparents are going to stand firm.  I think kids will respect us more in the <br/>\nlong run.    I notice that my kids are influenced by the behaviors of their <br/>\nneighbor friends, too, and that they &quot;try on&quot; some of those behaviors just to <br/>\nsee what the response is.  So, we talk a lot about manners, and polite <br/>\nbehavior, playing nicely, etc... and that if he sees others doing things they <br/>\nshould not do, than I expect him to do the right thing, and not just to go <br/>\nalong.  It is something to be talked about very often, as I want to really <br/>\nreinforce respecting others, and following our family rules.  Some days it <br/>\ncan feel like you&#39;ve been in combat, but down the road we will know that all <br/>\nthe hard work has paid off.  Take care, keep your chin up, and stand firm.  <br/>\n:)  ~Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"D Klement","from":"D Klement &lt;klement@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"y-8ZHuP8eQKWRu8zloh8JQ96KHfImeLZg6yvDjEeaPqsdLK8z_0lQmZEYkd_TnkW4h3PX3ZrdBzDWXC5QtH9EcmXpJvCC1s9","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] sassy kids","postDate":"964879283","msgId":11588,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5ODJFM0IzLjQyOTYzMUY2QGludGVybHlueC5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PExBVzItRjEzOXZDM3hLdU1WYTkwMDAwNjdkZkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":11583,"nextInTopic":11590,"prevInTime":11587,"nextInTime":11589,"topicId":11564,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I have recently come to learn that this may be the <br/>\nbiggest mistake I made with my children.  DH is gone a lot and I&#39;ve had to <br/>\nplay single parent.  It is not easy to stand up for yourself and I&#39;ve had <br/>\ntrouble figuring out how.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, DH was overseas for 20 months and when he returned he insisted on <br/>\ndoing things like opening my door, helping out of the car, little old <br/>\nfashioned things.  At first I tried to discourage him, thinking &#39;I&#39;m <br/>\nperfectly capable of opening my own doors, thank you!&#39;, &#39;and, this is slowing <br/>\nus down!&#39;  But then I saw my youngest (10 at the time) start trying to beat <br/>\nhis dad to open my door or carry in my books from church.  I realized then <br/>\nthat I had cheated my boys by not teaching them polite behavior.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow when I come home from grocery shopping it is DH and DS job to bring in <br/>\nthe groceries.  (I have FMS, so I&#39;m really exhausted by the time I get home!) <br/>\n I&#39;ve learned to not even think twice about expecting it of them.  DS has <br/>\nlearned it won&#39;t hurt him to bring in the groceries and help put them away.  <br/>\nbg<br/>\n<br/>\nThey aren&#39;t major brats (at least not usually...), but there still could have <br/>\nbeen more manners taught.  Especially for the oldest one.  I&#39;m seeing the <br/>\nresults now.  He married at 19 (yikes!) and they had a surprise baby a year <br/>\nand half later (when they got married they were told she couldn&#39;t have <br/>\nchildren, so it was a BIG surprise!!).  So, he&#39;s had a lot of adjustments to <br/>\nmake.  He just turned 22 and she is 20.  They lived with us the last 9 months <br/>\nor so and I could really see where he hadn&#39;t learned that it pays off to be <br/>\nnice. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was really stressful for them living with us (900 sq foot duplex, one <br/>\nbath, 4 adults, one 11 yr old, the toddler, 2 dogs...you get the picture).   <br/>\nBut, I&#39;m grateful that I had the chance to help retrain his thinking in this <br/>\narea.  At first when his dear wife would throw a tantrum (and believe me, I <br/>\nmean tantrum!  Only child, stubborn, spoiled and young.  but I&#39;m not her <br/>\nmummy)...anyway, when she would get mad, he would refuse to talk to her until <br/>\nshe straightened up; refuse to hear that she&#39;d had a bad day with the baby or <br/>\nwas frustrated because she was living with her in-laws, that sort of thing.  <br/>\n(I&#39;m a nice person, but what young wife wants to live with her <br/>\nmother-in-law?!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried explaining to him that it often pays off to be nice, hug her, listen <br/>\nto her feelings rather than concentrate on the actual words.  Finding actual <br/>\nsolutions could wait until after she knew she&#39;d been heard.  He simply didn&#39;t <br/>\nget it.  Couldn&#39;t see past himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne night she had an especially bad day with teething baby and feeling all <br/>\ncooped up.  DS was refusing to talk/listen to her and she was out in the car <br/>\ncrying (only place for her to be alone...she doesn&#39;t drive so she couldn&#39;t <br/>\neven take herself somewhere else!).  I took the baby from him, turned off the <br/>\nTV and told him to go out and talk to his wife.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe balked; saying she was just  throwing a tantrum.  I told him the baby had <br/>\nbeen fussy all day, he&#39;d been at work and interacting with other people while <br/>\nshe was stuck here with me and the baby all day...GO TALK TO YOUR WIFE.  It <br/>\nworked.  He went out and got in the car.  No idea what they talked about, but <br/>\nat least he wasn&#39;t ignoring her.  About 10 minutes later I stuck my head in <br/>\nthe car, gave them $10 and told him to take his wife for pizza.  G&#39;ma would <br/>\ngive the baby a bath and put her to bed for the night. (DIL actually hugged <br/>\nme for it the next day!  We are very short on funds, but that was probably <br/>\nthe best $10 I ever spent.  LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt worked!!  Finally, he was able to see that it pays off to be nice.  Since <br/>\nthen I&#39;ve caught him several times actually listening to wifey and hearing <br/>\nshe is having a bad day.  He even helps her find solutions rather than <br/>\ngetting into a blame game.  They are now in their own apartment and working <br/>\ntogether better than I&#39;ve seen before.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Gosh!  I&#39;m opinionated tonight!  sorry)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I agree with this point.

That means you are an <br/>\nadult, by definition, at least.  &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI took a parenting class way back when my kid was about that age (almost 15 <br/>\nyears ago!).  The most profound thing I heard in the whole 6 or 8 week class <br/>\nwas a mom talking about how frustrated she would get with her 5 yr old when <br/>\nhe would totally refuse to be cooperative and was generally rude and <br/>\nobnoxious and here she was trying her darnedest to be nice to the kid, (say <br/>\nnothing of avoiding a felonious act, ie murder!).  Anyway, she said she <br/>\nfinally figured it out:  if she (or DH) reacted to the child in like manner <br/>\n(yelling, being mad, etc.) there were suddenly twice as many 5 yr olds in the <br/>\nhouse!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, &#39;I&#39;m the mom&#39; means don&#39;t react like a 5/7/3 yr old, no matter how <br/>\ntempting it may be.  Stick to your guns as nicely as possible, but don&#39;t be a <br/>\ndoormat.  (nothing new here, huh?  You already know all this, don&#39;t you?  We <br/>\nall do and we all get frustrated in the heat of the battle.  Don&#39;t let it <br/>\nthrow you.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second most important thing I learned from that parenting class is that <br/>\nsooner or later your child is going to want something from you.  If he/she <br/>\nlearns that they are NOT going to get what they want by being rude or <br/>\nbreaking the rules, you will eventually have a bargaining chip.  Sometimes <br/>\nyou really have to wait and watch to find something that works.  In this case <br/>\nan example might be to refuse to get food while the child is demanding it.  <br/>\n(if that leaves you feeling guilty, have something available he can get for <br/>\nhimself...a cup of yogurt, slices of cheese, grapes, etc...and calmly say the <br/>\n&lt;fill in the blanks&gt; are in the fridge, help yourself).  Won&#39;t take long and <br/>\nhe&#39;ll get the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan&#39;t tackle every issue at the same time, though.  Pick your battles if you <br/>\ncan.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving given this very sage advice (LOL...it&#39;s really too bad you can&#39;t see <br/>\nmy own family to know how totally ridiculous it is for me to claim wisdom!), <br/>\nfirst take a gut level assessment of things at home/in your life and kidlet&#39;s <br/>\nlives.  Is there any turmoil going on?  Anyone teething?  Schedule off?  Mom <br/>\nor dad busier than usual?  Missing out on bedtime stories/prayers/bath or <br/>\nother rituals?  Getting enough sleep?  Enough down time?  Take the kids to <br/>\nthe park lately?  Played Legos?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that most of the time when kids are acting up suddenly, it is either <br/>\na growing stage where they are trying to find their place in the world or <br/>\nthere is something out of place in their lives.  My experience is that it can <br/>\noften be something that seems to be nothing out of the ordinary to the <br/>\nadults.  But, think about it, we have so much more life experience.  We know <br/>\nfrom our own experience that teething, for instance, really doesn&#39;t go on <br/>\nforever...the sore mouth will go away.  But little people just don&#39;t have <br/>\nthat frame of reference to yet.  They can&#39;t think past the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said all this...the best advice I&#39;ve seen yet was the one about the <br/>\nbubble bath!  Make sure you get some time to be an adult.  A chance to have <br/>\nconversations with other adults about adult things might be nice.  How long <br/>\nsince you and DH have been on a date?  (making an assumption here that you <br/>\nare married, based on age of kids)  When was the last time you went to a <br/>\ngrown up movie?  (pokemon does NOT count!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;ll pass.  Good luck.  I agree with the post that you are a good mom and it <br/>\nis apparent because you care enough to seek solutions.   I&#39;m confident you&#39;ll <br/>\nkeep looking until you find something that fits.  Sometimes that&#39;s the most <br/>\nimportant skill...tenacity to hang tough and find answers or wait out the <br/>\nstorm.  (of course, as soon as you figure out how to play the game, the kids <br/>\nwill change the rules and you get to start all over again!  bg)<br/>\n<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"M & J Welch","from":"&quot;M & J Welch&quot; &lt;seamus@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"MWEX2lkcFXa65agLQYKxE4fE17oluqHFYc6SPeTvE-Xjtx9UXt_2ScmLw_yOMh-Ft3fqxNihgWX8XWxgdtol9WUEYH0kSAO2oYPTjv0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] sassy kids","postDate":"964835219","msgId":11574,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PExQQkJJTURNUEdKQU9MS0JKSUlFR0VBRUNDQUEuc2VhbXVzQHBvcnR1cC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PExBVzItRjEzOXZDM3hLdU1WYTkwMDAwNjdkZkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":11573,"nextInTopic":11575,"prevInTime":11573,"nextInTime":11575,"topicId":11564,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Annette! :-) 2 of my kids are the same age as yours, and I also had problems with my 7 year old being rude, and my 3 year old copying him.

I swear, my 7 year old<br/>\nseemed to skip from the hyper active toddler behavior at about 4 1/2 to 5<br/>\nright into his teen age years. Grrr!! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s much better now, and my 3 year old no longer models his big brother&#39;s<br/>\nrudeness.  Instead he models his polite behavior. A few things played a part<br/>\nin this change.  First, I was given a Disney tape by my mom which tells<br/>\nstories and talks about polite behavior. I played it constantly. I also made<br/>\nuse of children&#39;s self-help storybooks that teach manners.  I&#39;m afraid I<br/>\ncan&#39;t think of any right now except &quot;Clifford&#39;s Manners&quot;, but that one is<br/>\npretty boring. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI set up a behavioral modification chart-writing out what kinds of behaviors<br/>\nI expected my son to follow and giving him stars whenever he did them. Some<br/>\nof the behaviors I delineated were saying thank you, please and your<br/>\nwelcome, not whining, not calling names etc.  When he earned enough stars he<br/>\nwas able to gain bigger rewards-like staying up later or a special treat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also sat down and had a talk with my son.  I explained how it made me feel<br/>\nto be spoken to rudely, and I made it clear that from now on I would not<br/>\nreacte rude requests.  The &quot;I&#39;m Hungry&quot; was a big one. I normally responded<br/>\nby saying &quot;Hi, hungry.  My name is Lee. How are you today?&quot; Sometimes it<br/>\nfelt like I was saying this all day long, but eventually it worked (after<br/>\nweeks and weeks). Be careful with this &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; bit.  A lot of the times<br/>\nthey aren&#39;t hungry, just bored. Or even thirsty. Depending upon the<br/>\nsituation, I would ask him, &quot;Are you really hungry, or could you be<br/>\nthirsty?&quot;  If he&#39;d just eaten I knew he was probably just bored. Distracting<br/>\nhim with an Otter pop (low sugar snack) and giving him a chore to do usually<br/>\nmotivated him to find something on his own. I also tried ignoring him, but,<br/>\nbeing human, I didn&#39;t always suceed.  In fact, he tended to behave worse<br/>\nwhen I did.  Humor really saved my sanity on a lot of days, since ignoring<br/>\nhim all the time was pretty impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I did was examine my own behavior closely.  I grew up in a<br/>\nfamily that yelled a lot-and I realised that I yelled a lot, too.  I also<br/>\nrealised that most of the time, instead of explaining why I wanted my son to<br/>\ndo something, I was simply giving commands.  I really dislike it when people<br/>\ntalk to me the way I was talking to my son, so I stopped talking to him that<br/>\nway-even when he was rude to me.  When he was rude, I would point it out to<br/>\nhim by saying &quot;You&#39;re not being polite to me.  Please try harder to say what<br/>\nyou want in a nice way so I can help you get it.&quot; When my son saw that I was<br/>\nlistening, he calmed down and rephrased his request in a polite way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also made it a point to praise him when he acted politely on his own, and<br/>\nlet him know how pleased I was with his behavior.

That means you are an<br/>\n&gt; adult, by definition, at least.  &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I took a parenting class way back when my kid was about that age (almost 15<br/>\n&gt; years ago!).  The most profound thing I heard in the whole 6 or 8 week class<br/>\n&gt; was a mom talking about how frustrated she would get with her 5 yr old when<br/>\n&gt; he would totally refuse to be cooperative and was generally rude and<br/>\n&gt; obnoxious and here she was trying her darnedest to be nice to the kid, (say<br/>\n&gt; nothing of avoiding a felonious act, ie murder!).  Anyway, she said she<br/>\n&gt; finally figured it out:  if she (or DH) reacted to the child in like manner<br/>\n&gt; (yelling, being mad, etc.) there were suddenly twice as many 5 yr olds in the<br/>\n&gt; house!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, &#39;I&#39;m the mom&#39; means don&#39;t react like a 5/7/3 yr old, no matter how<br/>\n&gt; tempting it may be.  Stick to your guns as nicely as possible, but don&#39;t be a<br/>\n&gt; doormat.  (nothing new here, huh?  You already know all this, don&#39;t you?  We<br/>\n&gt; all do and we all get frustrated in the heat of the battle.  Don&#39;t let it<br/>\n&gt; throw you.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The second most important thing I learned from that parenting class is that<br/>\n&gt; sooner or later your child is going to want something from you.  If he/she<br/>\n&gt; learns that they are NOT going to get what they want by being rude or<br/>\n&gt; breaking the rules, you will eventually have a bargaining chip.  Sometimes<br/>\n&gt; you really have to wait and watch to find something that works.  In this case<br/>\n&gt; an example might be to refuse to get food while the child is demanding it.<br/>\n&gt; (if that leaves you feeling guilty, have something available he can get for<br/>\n&gt; himself...a cup of yogurt, slices of cheese, grapes, etc...and calmly say the<br/>\n&gt; &lt;fill in the blanks&gt; are in the fridge, help yourself).  Won&#39;t take long and<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;ll get the idea.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can&#39;t tackle every issue at the same time, though.  Pick your battles if you<br/>\n&gt; can.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Having given this very sage advice (LOL...it&#39;s really too bad you can&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; my own family to know how totally ridiculous it is for me to claim wisdom!),<br/>\n&gt; first take a gut level assessment of things at home/in your life and kidlet&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; lives.  Is there any turmoil going on?  Anyone teething?  Schedule off?  Mom<br/>\n&gt; or dad busier than usual?  Missing out on bedtime stories/prayers/bath or<br/>\n&gt; other rituals?  Getting enough sleep?  Enough down time?  Take the kids to<br/>\n&gt; the park lately?  Played Legos?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think that most of the time when kids are acting up suddenly, it is either<br/>\n&gt; a growing stage where they are trying to find their place in the world or<br/>\n&gt; there is something out of place in their lives.  My experience is that it can<br/>\n&gt; often be something that seems to be nothing out of the ordinary to the<br/>\n&gt; adults.  But, think about it, we have so much more life experience.  We know<br/>\n&gt; from our own experience that teething, for instance, really doesn&#39;t go on<br/>\n&gt; forever...the sore mouth will go away.  But little people just don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; that frame of reference to yet.  They can&#39;t think past the moment.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Having said all this...the best advice I&#39;ve seen yet was the one about the<br/>\n&gt; bubble bath!  Make sure you get some time to be an adult.  A chance to have<br/>\n&gt; conversations with other adults about adult things might be nice.  How long<br/>\n&gt; since you and DH have been on a date?  (making an assumption here that you<br/>\n&gt; are married, based on age of kids)  When was the last time you went to a<br/>\n&gt; grown up movie?  (pokemon does NOT count!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;ll pass.  Good luck.  I agree with the post that you are a good mom and it<br/>\n&gt; is apparent because you care enough to seek solutions.   I&#39;m confident you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; keep looking until you find something that fits.  Sometimes that&#39;s the most<br/>\n&gt; important skill...tenacity to hang tough and find answers or wait out the<br/>\n&gt; storm.  (of course, as soon as you figure out how to play the game, the kids<br/>\n&gt; will change the rules and you get to start all over again!  bg)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Eiraul<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Earth Moon","from":"Earth Moon &lt;earthmoonwater@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"yfQ_tR2SCufSFoxKCjuCEH1nH7o6_mYNZJBCk74eXevXbgZqaS0rz7vXq3WCGX4U2_wP25YkpjR5NlXplaTWp231vXLyM92L598C235yzg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] sassy kids","postDate":"957127530","msgId":11635,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQuMy4xLjAuMjAwMDA0MzAxMzQ0MTUuMDBhZmM1OTBAbWFpbC53YS5mcmVlaS5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PEYzNkh4VGhZeHRVT3dDMmhCNGQwMDAwMjRlOUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":11633,"nextInTopic":11640,"prevInTime":11634,"nextInTime":11636,"topicId":11564,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
