There are many homeschoolers now that provide support, but I think the unschooling movement is coming about too slowly!  But when I hear what you have done with your DD I think, &quot;Yeah, I did this right, or I was doing that right, I should continue!&quot;  Although I must admit, I am still having a hard time with the fact that my kids shouldn&#39;t help out with the housework!

That is the least liked job around here!<br/>\n  I think I would be a lot more comfortable just letting my kids do whatever they wanted to all day long, if it weren&#39;t for my DH.  That is the real obstacle to the kids totally unschooling.  My oldest DD still makes out schedules and asks me to find out what she should be learning for her grade.  That is fine, she can learn what she wants when and how.  But the problem is, she is trying to do that with my younger DD, who hates schedules and curricula.  I have a feeling my DH is behind that!
