Seriously. It was painful to watch. BUT he needed<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; time to heal. It was VERY important!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Slowly, he started to do more. He started with IMing his friends. He&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  hated<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the computer in school, preferring to write assignments by hand. But<br/>\n&gt;&gt; he got<br/>\n&gt;&gt; *really* fast on the computer and knew more about its capabilities<br/>\n&gt;&gt; than  my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; husband or me in just a few short months.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I have another son, eight years younger. We&#39;d go somewhere almost <br/>\n&gt;&gt; every<br/>\n&gt;&gt; day----the park, the zoo, the beach, the library, a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; restaurant----*somewhere*.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;d ask each day whether Cameron would like to join us: his answer was<br/>\n&gt;&gt; always,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &quot;No.&quot; Then.....one day, I asked and he said, &quot;Yes!&quot; It was all I could<br/>\n&gt;&gt; do not<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to  jump up and do the happy dance----but I did one inside!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Then he started to join us more and more----and we started to do<br/>\n&gt;&gt; things HE<br/>\n&gt;&gt; wanted to do. He started drawing again, so I bought him some really<br/>\n&gt;&gt; nice papers<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  and charcoals.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; He and his friends started skateboarding, so we got him a skateboard<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sent him to Camp Woodward that summer. Then he started filming other<br/>\n&gt;&gt; skaters, so<br/>\n&gt;&gt; we got him a camera. That eventually led to more filming (and his<br/>\n&gt;&gt; first 6.5<br/>\n&gt;&gt; minute film). Now he volunteers at the local independent film theatre<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; called on by local film-makers to do camera work.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; He also asked for drums (who knows why!?), so he got drums one<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Christmas.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; He&#39;s really gotten into music. He&#39;s playing with three bands---all<br/>\n&gt;&gt; different<br/>\n&gt;&gt; styles. He&#39;s had a few lessons, but does it mostly on his own; only<br/>\n&gt;&gt; going to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Danny when he&#39;s struggling with something. He got a high-tech<br/>\n&gt;&gt; metronome  for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Christmas this year. (My dad thought that was SOOOO funny---that a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; child would<br/>\n&gt;&gt; *ask* for a metronome! &lt;g&gt;) He plays three-four  hours/day---sometimes<br/>\n&gt;&gt; more.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Luckily, the drums are in our DEtached garage!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; He&#39;s traveled to Seattle with Wilderness Ventures. He&#39;s made many road<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  trips<br/>\n&gt;&gt; on his own since he got his license. He&#39;s flying out to Albuquerque  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; by<br/>\n&gt;&gt; himself next month and to Europe with his cousin in September.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; He has three jobs: delivering a weekly paper to businesses,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; pet/house-sitting, and catering. He has his volunteer gig at the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; theatre. He has  the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; film-making that keeps him thinking and the drumming that has him<br/>\n&gt;&gt; finding/playing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; gigs at different bars every now and then.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; He&#39;s so busy now ----like he&#39;s making up for those lost months.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; He thought he was stupid and was going nowhere without a diploma.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt; what he heard from his friends. NOW his friends think his life is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; pretty sweet.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; So does he! &lt;g&gt; He has three friends from school that he still hangs<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; His girlfriend, who is also in school. But most of his friends are in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; their<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 20&#39;s, with one in his 30&#39;s and 2-3 in their 40&#39;s! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; He&#39;s into Buddhism and is a vegetarian (mostly &lt;g&gt;). He has a lot of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; questions and is not afraid to ask them. He LIKES his parents! &lt;g&gt; How<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  novel! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I just looked up at the subject. It says &quot;pros-cons question for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Kelly.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Cons: He still doesn&#39;t care to read much. He prefers non-fiction<br/>\n&gt;&gt; anyway---always<br/>\n&gt;&gt; has. Fiction he prefers through movies. Well, documentaries too! He<br/>\n&gt;&gt; just<br/>\n&gt;&gt; prefers  his information that way. But he reads just fine.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; He has his own back accounts and has been overdrawn once in three<br/>\n&gt;&gt; years. I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; doubt that&#39;ll happen again soon! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; He sat in on a college class last spring and was appalled at how<br/>\n&gt;&gt; little  the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; students wanted to be there. He liked the subject and participated in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; class, but I doubt he&#39;ll go to college. Some may see that as a con. I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; see  it as<br/>\n&gt;&gt; well-thought out at this time. But he knows he could do the  work.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; He&#39;s good to his girlfriend and sweet to the animals. He&#39;s gentle and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; patient with his little brother. He&#39;s a loyal friend, but seems to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; stay  away from<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the trouble some of them seem to wallow in.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; He seems more and more comfortable in his skin every day. Happy with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; who he<br/>\n&gt;&gt; is and what he&#39;s doing. THAT is the best part!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; That deschooling thing is hard----it&#39;s really, really hard. He needs<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to  know<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you&#39;re there. He needs to know you care. But he needs to be left to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; heal. I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t mean just left alone. There&#39;s this incredibly fine line between<br/>\n&gt;&gt; leaving<br/>\n&gt;&gt; him alone and letting him alone. I don&#39;t know how to explain it. But<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;&gt; know  it AFTER you&#39;re through it! &lt;G&gt; Go figure!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Riding in the car was a great place for us to talk---that&#39;s why we<br/>\n&gt;&gt; went to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the beach so much that first year! Duncan would fall asleep in the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; back seat,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and Cameron and I could talk and talk and talk with no interruptions<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; without looking at each other (at night with the lights off is good<br/>\n&gt;&gt; too!).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Quit nagging. Offer cool things to do and good movies to watch. Eat<br/>\n&gt;&gt; out a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; lot. Be his partner. Work together. Let him know that you&#39;re willing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to let him<br/>\n&gt;&gt; heal from that school damage.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; It gets better! It gets GREAT!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ~Kelly<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!

I <br/>\n&gt; see  it as<br/>\n&gt; well-thought out at this time. But he knows he could do the  work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s good to his girlfriend and sweet to the animals. He&#39;s gentle and<br/>\n&gt; patient with his little brother. He&#39;s a loyal friend, but seems to <br/>\n&gt; stay  away from<br/>\n&gt; the trouble some of them seem to wallow in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He seems more and more comfortable in his skin every day. Happy with <br/>\n&gt; who he<br/>\n&gt; is and what he&#39;s doing. THAT is the best part!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That deschooling thing is hard----it&#39;s really, really hard. He needs <br/>\n&gt; to  know<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re there. He needs to know you care. But he needs to be left to <br/>\n&gt; heal. I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t mean just left alone. There&#39;s this incredibly fine line between <br/>\n&gt; leaving<br/>\n&gt; him alone and letting him alone. I don&#39;t know how to explain it. But <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; know  it AFTER you&#39;re through it! &lt;G&gt; Go figure!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Riding in the car was a great place for us to talk---that&#39;s why we <br/>\n&gt; went to<br/>\n&gt; the beach so much that first year! Duncan would fall asleep in the <br/>\n&gt; back seat,<br/>\n&gt; and Cameron and I could talk and talk and talk with no interruptions <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; without looking at each other (at night with the lights off is good <br/>\n&gt; too!).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Quit nagging. Offer cool things to do and good movies to watch. Eat <br/>\n&gt; out a<br/>\n&gt; lot. Be his partner. Work together. Let him know that you&#39;re willing <br/>\n&gt; to let him<br/>\n&gt; heal from that school damage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It gets better! It gets GREAT!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Kelly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
