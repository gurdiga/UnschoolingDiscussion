It&#39;s a much bigger pita than I&#39;m willing to invite into my life -- and one of my neighbors is a genuine concern.  She&#39;s the queen of nuisance complaints to the city.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy kids aren&#39;t afraid of someone knowing we they don&#39;t go to school -- they tell anyone who asks, and often folks who don&#39;t ask.  Because our lifestyle isn&#39;t mainstream, they know we are cautious.   <br/>\n <br/>\nI guess, too, timing had a lot to do with it.

They may<br/>\njust have had someone complain and think they can bully you around. <br/>\nYou have rights in MO and as long as you have your ducks in a row,<br/>\nthere is nothing they can do. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you logged any hours at all this &quot;school year&quot;?  What you need<br/>\nmost is to have started some form of logging 1000 hours. I would do<br/>\none of two things: 1. go to a teacher supply store and get a teachers<br/>\nweekly planner and fill in the spaces for your hours and just put down<br/>\nwhat you have done since the beginning of Sept. If we read a book, I<br/>\nlog it as an hour, if we go to the park, it&#39;s P.E. for an hour, if<br/>\nthey play Yugio cards I log math for an hour, etc.  It&#39;s only a few<br/>\nweeks, so you should be able to put down enough that you can show<br/>\nproof that you are doing things &quot;by the law&quot;.  2. If you don&#39;t want to<br/>\nhand write it, you can use Missouri Logger Rhythms.  Do a google<br/>\nsearch.  It&#39;s a program that you can do the same thing with and it<br/>\nprints out nice pretty monthly hours that look very schoolish. It&#39;s<br/>\nperfect for unschoolers b/c it prints out a log with just the core<br/>\nhours/noncore hours without listing all the things that they might not<br/>\nsee as schoolish enough to log. I just log what we do everyday and try<br/>\nto put it into subjects.  This way I&#39;m covered if I need it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, legally, no one can demand to see your hours without a court<br/>\norder.  So, calm down and try to read up about your rights in MO.  The<br/>\nonly thing you need by law is to log 1000 hours in a year and have<br/>\nsome sort of portfolio (pictures, etc). I don&#39;t worry too much about<br/>\nthe porfolio stuff, I just keep any pictures or things they write.<br/>\nThat&#39;s it.  There is also a site on missouri homeschool law that you<br/>\ncan read up on your rights. I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have any links on this<br/>\ncomputer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be furious that he questioned my child over the phone! I&#39;m<br/>\nsure things will turn out fine.

If the person on the phone pesters you, all the more reason to REPEAT, my mom can&#39;t come to the phone.  If a kid is not able to do this, perhaps they should not be left home alone ever or should be instructed to NOT answer the phone.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though my kids are 11 and 9, we use the answering machine anyway, so they wouldn&#39;t need to answer the phone when they are home alone.  On our machine, you can hear the caller leaving the message.  They can easily pick it up or call back if it is someone they wish to talk to, or me calling to check on them.  It is well worth the price to have this sort of answering machine!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] The Dreaded Phone Call...","postDate":"1095262645","msgId":99594,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDQxNDg0NzJCLjgwMDAxMDdAY2xhcy5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":99585,"nextInTopic":99595,"prevInTime":99593,"nextInTime":99595,"topicId":99585,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m upset and alittle afraid right now... while I was away from home yesterday afternoon, my 14 yo daughter got a phone call from a man claiming to be an","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1812250008\">I&#39;m upset and alittle afraid right now... while I was away from home <br/>\nyesterday afternoon, my 14 yo daughter got a phone call from a man <br/>\nclaiming to be an &#39;investigator&#39; I&#39;m assuming from DFS.. he knew my <br/>\nchildren&#39;s names, asked which one he was talking too.. also asked if we <br/>\nhomeschooled.
