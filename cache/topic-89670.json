I&#39;ve learned to take <br/>\nvery good care of my kids&#39; mother. &lt;g&gt;  I may be experiencing the new <br/>\nbaby syndrome, along with unschooling -- Riley (7 mo.) definitely <br/>\nprefers mom over others right now.  I&#39;m just at the stage where <br/>\nteenage babysitters don&#39;t really cut it with the baby, and the <br/>\nclosest Grandma prefers to babysit at her house, not here.  So I&#39;m <br/>\ninterested in how people treat themselves well when it just really <br/>\nwon&#39;t work for them to go out.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we are finding solutions -- when I *had* to go grocery shopping, <br/>\nFisher agreed to spend an hour at Grandma&#39;s rather than go through <br/>\nthe store with me.  And tonight we were supposed to go to her place <br/>\nfor dinner -- but since I&#39;m here, posting, you can guess what <br/>\nhappened. &lt;g&gt;  Grandma was very understanding, and praised us for <br/>\nlistening to our child. (!)  My husband went (it&#39;s his family), and I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t really feel like going anyway.  So it worked.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best part is, we are talking about this as a family.  Fisher was <br/>\ntrying to get some enthusiasm up for going (&quot;they do have good food <br/>\nthere . . .&quot;) but in the end just didn&#39;t want to go.  He offered some <br/>\ntrades, was trying to hear what we wanted (to attend church some <br/>\nSundays) and negotiate with that.

For example,<br/>\nif you need groceries, show him the frig and pantry<br/>\nand tell him what you need, and ask him what he&#39;d like<br/>\nat the store. Reminding him that his favorites are not<br/>\n&quot;in stock&quot;, that he could pick up something new to<br/>\ntry, whatever works for him, might distract him from<br/>\nthe newness of his power to choose not to go. lol <br/>\n<br/>\nYou may want to share a bit of the decision making<br/>\nprocess that you go thru when deciding you need food,<br/>\nor when to visit grandma, not make it him choosing or<br/>\nyou choosing when to go.  does that make sense? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you start out on the right foot, I think that it&#39;s<br/>\nmuch easier to &quot;work it out with him&quot; than you might<br/>\nbe used to.  It takes quite a bit of practice to not<br/>\nmake it a power struggle from the get go. That might<br/>\nbe the issue here. <br/>\n<br/>\n Like, if you need food, tell him that, instead of,<br/>\nyou need to go to the store with me.  It doesn&#39;t sound<br/>\nmuch different to you and I maybe, but it might sound<br/>\ndifferent to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour post made me think, have you always had a<br/>\nhomebody, and you just didn&#39;t know it til now?  lol <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;I bring this up because I&#39;m wondering if those of<br/>\nyou (like Sheila) <br/>\nthat have homebodies have tips that you can share for<br/>\nhelping me deal <br/>\nwith it.

Just dealing with the cabin<br/>\nfever, esp. when <br/>\nmy husband is out of town (sometimes 2 weeks at a time<br/>\n-- the <br/>\nweekends are the hardest, &#39;cause tho I like to be at<br/>\nhome, by then I <br/>\nwant to get out).

Usually it&#39;s<br/>\nnot much more than doing the grocery shopping and<br/>\nsuch, but I always slip in something that I enjoy as<br/>\nwell.  Bookstores, coffee shop, cruising the racks at<br/>\nGoodwill, window shopping at the mall, spending an<br/>\nhour in the craft store.  If you&#39;re hubby&#39;s not home,<br/>\nbut you&#39;re mom&#39;s around, she could come by for an hour<br/>\nor two maybe?  You could get out and your son could<br/>\nstay home?  <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery few months,  Alex is off to the inlaws<br/>\novernight, usually his cousin goes over too.  Hubby<br/>\nand I go out to dinner and a movie, sleep in, and pick<br/>\nhim up the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He likes the novelty of being at Abuela&#39;s, they push<br/>\nthe LR couches together and she sleeps with them, she<br/>\nmakes pancakes at 6 am, lol, she kicks his butt at all<br/>\nthe bored.com games that I don&#39;t play very well, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that we do is, once a month, all the<br/>\nin laws, cousins, and friends get together for Game<br/>\nDay.  I get an entire Saturday to myself, and they go<br/>\nplay Halo for 8 hours, eat junk food, and just<br/>\ngenerally geek out. lol <br/>\n<br/>\nLike Liza said in a post not too long ago, if you need<br/>\nalone time, free time, whatever, don&#39;t ignore that. <br/>\nIt might be tough on you right now to go from dropping<br/>\nhim off at school and having hours long blocks of time<br/>\nto yourself, and transitioning to being a full time<br/>\ncaregiver.

As it is, I have to <br/>\nschlepp them around town so they can get their people fix with other <br/>\nhomeschoolers. My kids are very, VERY sociable. They love to be around <br/>\npeople.

No <br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have recently written more about the lunacy of going it alone by many <br/>\nparents, especially homeschooling parents. I see that here in NY and <br/>\nread of it on many of these national lists. I wanted to have my kids in <br/>\nthe world, that&#39;s why I decided that not going to school would actually <br/>\nimpinge on their being in the real world --aka: their socialization-- <br/>\nand not enhance it.

This <br/>\nschool will be slightly different from the typical model in the fact that we will <br/>\nattempt to house the children and also find a way in which parents could work <br/>\noff a LOW tuition. We would like this school to be able to include children in <br/>\nany financial bracket. Also, because of the remote location we feel as though <br/>\nhousing would be necessary. Eastern Maine is a BEAUTIFUL place with <br/>\nendless outdoor adventures waiting to be created. We are aiming for a first <br/>\nyear enrollment of 6-8 children and a tuition in the sub 2000 dollar range with <br/>\nthe possibility of a great deal being able to be worked off. <br/>\nI am writing this email to see what type of interest is out there for this amazing <br/>\nexperience. It is a truly once in a lifetime experience that we will go through to <br/>\nget the school off the ground. Please pass this email on to anyone who you <br/>\nthink be interested in this method of living and learning. Also, feel free to <br/>\ncontact me with any questions about myself, my background, or details on the <br/>\narea.
