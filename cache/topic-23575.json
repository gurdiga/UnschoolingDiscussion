My 8yo ds has an aversion to<br/>\nreading.  No matter what the word might be, he will say he can&#39;t read it,<br/>\nexcept maybe &quot;no&quot; or &quot;stop&quot;.  My 4yo is asking to learn to read so I labeled<br/>\neverything in the house (suggested by a thread on this board, thanks!!).  I<br/>\nasked 4yo Marsie is she wanted to play a treasure hunt and she did.  So I<br/>\nmade a duplicate set of cards and we would tape those up behind the first<br/>\nset of labels in a manner so that when you found the match to the card in<br/>\nyour hand, you look behind it and the card taped there would tell you where<br/>\nto go next.  Marsie played a couple of times but then wanted to go do<br/>\nsomething else.  The 8yo Zach became enthralled with the game (he loves<br/>\nprizes, even if the prize is one of his cars that he already owns but we<br/>\nhave hidden).  He knew almost all the words already, things like &quot;cabinet&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;computer&quot;, &quot;bulletin board&quot;.  He didn&#39;t need to run around and match the<br/>\nletters on the card to the ones on the labels.  He simply read them and took<br/>\noff at a dead run.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point of this way too long post is that Zach could read, he often chose<br/>\nnot to read but he COULD read if push came to shove.
