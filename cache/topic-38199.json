It<br/>\nwasn&#39;t because I didn&#39;t love or want my kids it was<br/>\nbecause I didn&#39;t love myself.  I had a neighbor tell<br/>\nme that I needed to go into counseling.  She just so<br/>\nhappened to know somebody who was a non-profit<br/>\ncounselor and this situation changed my life and<br/>\nenabled me to help myself and my ADD child as well as<br/>\nbe able to homeschool. Her love and support really<br/>\nhelped me through this time. Maybe she was put into<br/>\nyour path for a reason.
