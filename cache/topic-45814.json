But, as with anything, we take what works for us and leave the rest. I have fond memories of the nicknames I grew up with, and the boys love theirs, and I love the ones they have for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, both boys are left alone to do whatever they want to do. I&#39;ll let them know if something&#39;s going on so they can take part if they want to, but that&#39;s it. Neither of them are pushed into anything, never have been. That&#39;s what unschooling&#39;s all about, right? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nMyranda <br/>\n  Myranda, I can remember reading in the book How to Talk So Kids Will <br/>\n  Listen... how labeling (&quot;he&#39;s our little lazybones&quot;), even lovingly, our <br/>\n  kids can really set them up for filling roles rather than just Being Who <br/>\n  They Are.  If you can get a copy of that book from the library, I think you <br/>\n  will really enjoy reading that section!  It&#39;s an eye-opener!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;He&#39;s getting better a tiny bit at a time. Now he&#39;ll at least go and do <br/>\n  &gt;things when we&#39;re out, when just last summer he wouldn&#39;t. Sorry about the <br/>\n  &gt;&quot;can&#39;t even recgonize&quot;, though, I should have put &quot;can&#39;t&quot; or &quot;doesn&#39;t <br/>\n  &gt;recgonize&quot; but when speed-typing with a baby standing up by pulling on <br/>\n  &gt;your hair, you tend to not be as particular about wording. &lt;g&gt;   Oh, he <br/>\n  &gt;has learned to recgonize and spell his name this last month, so I am <br/>\n  &gt;thankful for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I would also suggest (I haven&#39;t read all the other answers yet, and someone <br/>\n  else may have said these things, probably much more eloquently) that you <br/>\n  take a look at how you may be pushing him to do things on your clock rather <br/>\n  than his clock.  We all do the things *we* need to do when *we* see the <br/>\n  need to do them.  He may just enjoy sitting there doing nothing but being <br/>\n  with his own thoughts and feelings.  How delightful it is to have the space <br/>\n  to do that.  Recognizing letters and spelling your name is something you <br/>\n  have to see the need for before you want to learn to do it.  If he feels <br/>\n  rushed or pushed into learning things he may not be getting the freedom to <br/>\n  learn things from his own internal desire.  There&#39;s a huge difference I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Warmly,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Marji<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Sometimes on<br/>\nour lazy days we&#39;ll go to the beach or a park and just sit and watch the<br/>\nclouds and people go by. Lazy, to us, is a warm-fuzzy-snuggly-type word used<br/>\nmore to describe a just-wanna-take-it-easy mood or day.<br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  How about unmotivated? Unmotivated gets the adult thinking about what<br/>\n  the problem could be and what they could do to motivate the child.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lazy is such an ugly label that usually says more about the person<br/>\n  saying it than the one it is attached to.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe you&#39;re feeling a bit lazy (fill in stressed out, over-whelmed,<br/>\n  needy) with all the youngsters so that you aren&#39;t able to provide the<br/>\n  right kind of encouragement that fits *his* needs? See what I mean?<br/>\n  The label &quot;Lazy&quot; just gets in the way of getting to a solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kids do things at different times and see things and life in different<br/>\n  ways from their parents. Half the fun of being a parent is figuring<br/>\n  out the unique abililies and ways of seeing the world that our<br/>\n  children have. Negative labels limit both parents and children, they<br/>\n  get in the way of solutions and they hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Not that I didn&#39;t hear plenty of those ugly labels when I was a child.<br/>\n  I have to consciously *not* use them with my own children. And, by<br/>\n  doing so, I&#39;ve managed to heal some of the pain those labels caused me<br/>\n  when I was a child. And, the more I practice not using them, the<br/>\n  easier it gets. We can reprogram those negative tapes that play in our<br/>\n  heads, and sometimes we don&#39;t even realize are there, until we hear<br/>\n  our parent&#39;s negative words coming out of our mouths directed at our<br/>\n  own children.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Peggy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Myranda&quot; &lt;myrandab@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; Yes, lazy because he&#39;d rather miss a meal than have to actually get<br/>\n  up and walk to the table.

We sent hime to the local Waldrof school. His siter<br/>\n  followed in k the following year and I taught music there. after two years<br/>\n  we decided the school was a challenging community to be part of in many<br/>\n  ways. Last year I stated homeschooling. We did fun projects and story<br/>\n  lessons and feild trips on north american indians of our area. that was fun<br/>\n  for about 2 months. but it got old the kids said we don&#39;t really want to do<br/>\n  this can we just do our own thing. I said great. From then to mid sept they<br/>\n  did what they liked. Abbie has taught herself the piano is doing<br/>\n  scrapbooking, in gymnastics, swimming dog 4h and sometimes reads a little<br/>\n  but she is at go dog go level. She is very tenacious and likes to challenge<br/>\n  herself. I feel comfortable unschooling her because she does stuff that is<br/>\n  recognizable learning. Nikolas on the other hand hangs out rides his bike<br/>\n  reads harry potter for the eigthieth time  does his chores sometimes and has<br/>\n  gone through his bank account of sixty dollars on candy. This year i decided<br/>\n  to do structured school with him using oak meadow 5th grade. he seemed to be<br/>\n  needing some structure because he was always upset and tense and seemed to<br/>\n  be asking for something but I wasn&#39;t sure what. well he doesn&#39;t like it, not<br/>\n  at all. I am doing a lot of nagging on everything and restricting him if he<br/>\n  doesn&#39;t do his work. (I know y&#39;all are cringing. He often has tantrums and<br/>\n  is very reclcitrant. Yet when he finally does begin his work 90% of the time<br/>\n  he likes it is proud and says he likes doing it as says he wished he hadn&#39;t<br/>\n  put up a fuss. but he almost always balks the next time. The reason I chose<br/>\n  to be structured woth him is to give him a chance to work hard at something<br/>\n  and stay with it. he avoids complicated projects, work, thinking etc. Or<br/>\n  this is the waty he seems to me. He likes to be very comfotable  and know<br/>\n  something well before he might risk tryng something new. which happens only<br/>\n  at urging. Anyway in my heart I am a true unschooler and would like to give<br/>\n  hime the chance to follow something. Everytime drop academis expectations I<br/>\n  get panicky he just hangs out in his room or on his bike and I don&#39;t even<br/>\n  see him. He is not interested in doing projects with abbie and I. Can<br/>\n  someone help talk me to me more about this. My head says he should be my<br/>\n  heart says  let go of those academic expectations. ( he reads well and is<br/>\n  good at math already) I hope this is not to long a diatribe. YOu all seem so<br/>\n  comfotable hanging out and following your kids leads. I can do that with<br/>\n  abbie because she is so curious but nikolas has me stumped. Hubby also<br/>\n  thinks work is very important. tahnk you for listening<br/>\n  Josie   mom, worrier and closet control freak.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

It is great to hear about your kids though!! :-)<br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Mary Bianco <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Okay, I certainly don&#39;t want to overwhelm you because I think you may get a <br/>\n  bit of response on this one. But I do have to say &#39;something.&#39; And only <br/>\n  because the way you put it sounds as if deep down inside, it does bother <br/>\n  you.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So I think what really helps is not just to have people say stop worrying. <br/>\n  That NEVER works for me. But maybe just hearing that we all have kids or <br/>\n  know kids like that and they are fine and productive and loving and caring <br/>\n  and smart, will help.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Even if you never say what you said on list to your son, he&#39;s going to get <br/>\n  that idea from you. Trust me on this one, he will. My Sierra, who is almost <br/>\n  7 in a few months, was very quiet when she was younger when it came to being <br/>\n  around new people or even family she wasn&#39;t familiar with that much. She was <br/>\n  labeled shy of course. I tried very hard to not have people say that around <br/>\n  her and never used it myself out loud, point was I was thinking it cause <br/>\n  what other way could I explain it? Well why should I have to explain it????? <br/>\n  She obviously wasn&#39;t ready for whatever it was everyone else thought she <br/>\n  should do. I relaxed and eased way up and never made excuses for her, I just <br/>\n  let her be. She&#39;s a darn bubbly little thing now who&#39;s has loud and screamy <br/>\n  (in a happy way) than any other kid I know.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My Joseph, almost 8 in a few months, was never one to be with us as a <br/>\n  family. We would rent a movie for family night and he would never make it <br/>\n  even half way through. He would get up and go to his room to play. When we <br/>\n  would all play inside, he would go outside. When we would play ball ouside, <br/>\n  he would leave and go to his room. It was so obvious that it really started <br/>\n  to bother me that there was a problem. Thank God my husband picks up that <br/>\n  unschooly behavior when I sometimes faulter!!! He said to let him be, he was <br/>\n  fine, he needed his own time right now and it was no big deal. Although we <br/>\n  both were bothered that he wouldn&#39;t be with us.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Long story short, somewhat, he&#39;s fine now and very involved in whatever we <br/>\n  all do. He still needs his time alone and we give it to him now just as we <br/>\n  did before. He just learned by the way to tie his bathing suit this year. He <br/>\n  has velcro sneakers!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Relax and realize that these are our babies yet and so very young at the <br/>\n  ages most of us are speaking of. Believe me when they are 16, you will <br/>\n  wonder where all the years went and want that little couch potatoe candy <br/>\n  eating crying for mommy little rug rat back. Enjoy each day for each day and <br/>\n  watch and learn right along with them. They will grow and learn and blossom <br/>\n  before you know it. Don&#39;t rush, don&#39;t judge and don&#39;t label. It really does <br/>\n  more harm than good.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n  Join the world&#39;s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

Maybe<br/>\n&gt;your son is having a hard time understanding what it is he wants because<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;re not certain yourself.

But I do have to say &#39;something.&#39; And only <br/>\nbecause the way you put it sounds as if deep down inside, it does bother <br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think what really helps is not just to have people say stop worrying. <br/>\nThat NEVER works for me. But maybe just hearing that we all have kids or <br/>\nknow kids like that and they are fine and productive and loving and caring <br/>\nand smart, will help.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you never say what you said on list to your son, he&#39;s going to get <br/>\nthat idea from you. Trust me on this one, he will. My Sierra, who is almost <br/>\n7 in a few months, was very quiet when she was younger when it came to being <br/>\naround new people or even family she wasn&#39;t familiar with that much. She was <br/>\nlabeled shy of course. I tried very hard to not have people say that around <br/>\nher and never used it myself out loud, point was I was thinking it cause <br/>\nwhat other way could I explain it? Well why should I have to explain it????? <br/>\nShe obviously wasn&#39;t ready for whatever it was everyone else thought she <br/>\nshould do. I relaxed and eased way up and never made excuses for her, I just <br/>\nlet her be. She&#39;s a darn bubbly little thing now who&#39;s has loud and screamy <br/>\n(in a happy way) than any other kid I know.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Joseph, almost 8 in a few months, was never one to be with us as a <br/>\nfamily. We would rent a movie for family night and he would never make it <br/>\neven half way through. He would get up and go to his room to play. When we <br/>\nwould all play inside, he would go outside. When we would play ball ouside, <br/>\nhe would leave and go to his room. It was so obvious that it really started <br/>\nto bother me that there was a problem. Thank God my husband picks up that <br/>\nunschooly behavior when I sometimes faulter!!! He said to let him be, he was <br/>\nfine, he needed his own time right now and it was no big deal. Although we <br/>\nboth were bothered that he wouldn&#39;t be with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong story short, somewhat, he&#39;s fine now and very involved in whatever we <br/>\nall do. He still needs his time alone and we give it to him now just as we <br/>\ndid before. He just learned by the way to tie his bathing suit this year. He <br/>\nhas velcro sneakers!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nRelax and realize that these are our babies yet and so very young at the <br/>\nages most of us are speaking of. Believe me when they are 16, you will <br/>\nwonder where all the years went and want that little couch potatoe candy <br/>\neating crying for mommy little rug rat back. Enjoy each day for each day and <br/>\nwatch and learn right along with them. They will grow and learn and blossom <br/>\nbefore you know it. Don&#39;t rush, don&#39;t judge and don&#39;t label.

I&#39;ve never done more than ask if they want to do something, or offer it up as an option, to either one of the boys. My oldest jumps at the chance, while the youngest doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s fine with me. :-)<br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n  Ok, Ok,  lets remember that we are all learning.<br/>\n  I used to think the same thing about my son, because he wouldn&#39;t get up to do a whole lot, but I really, really thought alot about it.   I really think I had been so hard on him for his first years that he didn&#39;t know what to do, I&#39;m trying to be much more accepting and just be understanding and loving.  I also have a 5 yr old and she kind-of recognizes her letters and she doesn&#39;t tie her shoes, and you know what, it doesn&#39;t matter.  They will learn when they learn.  I have to keep telling myself that they grow up sooo fast and what&#39;s the big deal to just help her with things, she&#39;s only 5!!!      And even my son who is 9 is still only 9!  It is still so young. <br/>\n  We expect so much from our children at such young ages, we don&#39;t allow them to be kids.  My son is just now willing to try things because I have been laying off him for the last 6 months or so.  For so long I&#39;m sure I just would do everything for him and not encourage him or anything.  If I were him I wouldn&#39;t do anything either, I would be &#39;lazy&#39; too.<br/>\n  Looking at our children in different ways really opens eyes. Look at them as individuals give them respect like you or I  would want.   Regarding encouragement---Relax and have fun!  And you know what before you know it that &#39;lazy&#39; kid will be doing everything with you.  And life will be good.   (I miss Mary!

Neither DH or I grew up hearing that word used, and we use it only, like I said, as a fond nickname &quot;lazybones&quot;, and we have &quot;lazy Sunday&#39;s&quot; about once a month when we eat leftovers all day, watch tv, read, or play games all day, and just enjoy being with each other - we don&#39;t do a single thing we don&#39;t feel like doing (well, except for feeding the animals). Sometimes on our lazy days we&#39;ll go to the beach or a park and just sit and watch the clouds and people go by. Lazy, to us, is a warm-fuzzy-snuggly-type word used more to describe a just-wanna-take-it-easy mood or day. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  How about unmotivated? Unmotivated gets the adult thinking about what <br/>\n  the problem could be and what they could do to motivate the child. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Lazy is such an ugly label that usually says more about the person <br/>\n  saying it than the one it is attached to.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe you&#39;re feeling a bit lazy (fill in stressed out, over-whelmed, <br/>\n  needy) with all the youngsters so that you aren&#39;t able to provide the <br/>\n  right kind of encouragement that fits *his* needs? See what I mean? <br/>\n  The label &quot;Lazy&quot; just gets in the way of getting to a solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kids do things at different times and see things and life in different <br/>\n  ways from their parents. Half the fun of being a parent is figuring <br/>\n  out the unique abililies and ways of seeing the world that our <br/>\n  children have. Negative labels limit both parents and children, they <br/>\n  get in the way of solutions and they hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Not that I didn&#39;t hear plenty of those ugly labels when I was a child. <br/>\n  I have to consciously *not* use them with my own children. And, by <br/>\n  doing so, I&#39;ve managed to heal some of the pain those labels caused me <br/>\n  when I was a child. And, the more I practice not using them, the <br/>\n  easier it gets. We can reprogram those negative tapes that play in our <br/>\n  heads, and sometimes we don&#39;t even realize are there, until we hear <br/>\n  our parent&#39;s negative words coming out of our mouths directed at our <br/>\n  own children.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Peggy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Myranda&quot; &lt;myrandab@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; Yes, lazy because he&#39;d rather miss a meal than have to actually get <br/>\n  up and walk to the table.

They are not allowed<br/>\n  to be home alone, they are not allowed to drive, have a job, vote.  The<br/>\n  only reason a five year old would NEED to recognize letters is if he was<br/>\n  in school and it was an inconvenience to his teacher for him not to.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Buy Velcro shoes.  Or tie them for him.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Make his sandwich for him, or show him how ten times if he wants you to. <br/>\n  We understand that learning to walk and talk takes time but we think<br/>\n  other skills are supposed to be automatic.  Some people need to see a<br/>\n  thing many times before they understand it.  Some people need help with<br/>\n  the doing for a long time before they&#39;re ready to do it on their own.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Even if you never say lazy in front of him he will know that&#39;s what you<br/>\n  think of him.  That can&#39;t help him be a better person and it doesn&#39;t make<br/>\n  you look like a better mom in his eyes.  It&#39;s only going to hurt, and<br/>\n  hurt in a way that will last his whole life and you can&#39;t really want<br/>\n  that for your little man.  That&#39;s really, really harsh, and not a nice<br/>\n  way to talk about someone who needs your loving attention.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe things really are too hard.  Not every five year old is ready for<br/>\n  this stuff.  You have a little baby don&#39;t you?   Has your five year old<br/>\n  been expected to do more for himself since the baby came?   He must seem<br/>\n  like a big boy to you compared to the little one, but five is very small.<br/>\n  Very, very small, and maybe he&#39;s overwhelmed.   Maybe he&#39;d like to be<br/>\n  your little baby again.  You could baby him some and he will grow<br/>\n  happily.   When people feel good about themselves they can accomplish<br/>\n  much more than people who feel, and have heard, that they can&#39;t do<br/>\n  anything and they&#39;re lazy.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Deb L <br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I really think I had been so hard on him for his first years that he didn&#39;t know what to do, I&#39;m trying to be much more accepting and just be understanding and loving.  I also have a 5 yr old and she kind-of recognizes her letters and she doesn&#39;t tie her shoes, and you know what, it doesn&#39;t matter.  They will learn when they learn.  I have to keep telling myself that they grow up sooo fast and what&#39;s the big deal to just help her with things, she&#39;s only 5!!!      And even my son who is 9 is still only 9!  It is still so young. <br/>\nWe expect so much from our children at such young ages, we don&#39;t allow them to be kids.  My son is just now willing to try things because I have been laying off him for the last 6 months or so.  For so long I&#39;m sure I just would do everything for him and not encourage him or anything.  If I were him I wouldn&#39;t do anything either, I would be &#39;lazy&#39; too.<br/>\nLooking at our children in different ways really opens eyes. Look at them as individuals give them respect like you or I  would want.   Regarding encouragement---Relax and have fun!  And you know what before you know it that &#39;lazy&#39; kid will be doing everything with you.  And life will be good.   (I miss Mary!

The<br/>\nonly reason a five year old would NEED to recognize letters is if he was<br/>\nin school and it was an inconvenience to his teacher for him not to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBuy Velcro shoes.  Or tie them for him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMake his sandwich for him, or show him how ten times if he wants you to. <br/>\nWe understand that learning to walk and talk takes time but we think<br/>\nother skills are supposed to be automatic.

We sent hime to the local Waldrof school. His siter<br/>\n  followed in k the following year and I taught music there. after two years<br/>\n  we decided the school was a challenging community to be part of in many<br/>\n  ways. Last year I stated homeschooling. We did fun projects and story<br/>\n  lessons and feild trips on north american indians of our area. that was fun<br/>\n  for about 2 months. but it got old the kids said we don&#39;t really want to do<br/>\n  this can we just do our own thing. I said great. From then to mid sept they<br/>\n  did what they liked. Abbie has taught herself the piano is doing<br/>\n  scrapbooking, in gymnastics, swimming dog 4h and sometimes reads a little<br/>\n  but she is at go dog go level. She is very tenacious and likes to challenge<br/>\n  herself. I feel comfortable unschooling her because she does stuff that is<br/>\n  recognizable learning. Nikolas on the other hand hangs out rides his bike<br/>\n  reads harry potter for the eigthieth time  does his chores sometimes and has<br/>\n  gone through his bank account of sixty dollars on candy. This year i decided<br/>\n  to do structured school with him using oak meadow 5th grade. he seemed to be<br/>\n  needing some structure because he was always upset and tense and seemed to<br/>\n  be asking for something but I wasn&#39;t sure what. well he doesn&#39;t like it, not<br/>\n  at all. I am doing a lot of nagging on everything and restricting him if he<br/>\n  doesn&#39;t do his work. (I know y&#39;all are cringing. He often has tantrums and<br/>\n  is very reclcitrant. Yet when he finally does begin his work 90% of the time<br/>\n  he likes it is proud and says he likes doing it as says he wished he hadn&#39;t<br/>\n  put up a fuss. but he almost always balks the next time. The reason I chose<br/>\n  to be structured woth him is to give him a chance to work hard at something<br/>\n  and stay with it. he avoids complicated projects, work, thinking etc. Or<br/>\n  this is the waty he seems to me. He likes to be very comfotable  and know<br/>\n  something well before he might risk tryng something new. which happens only<br/>\n  at urging. Anyway in my heart I am a true unschooler and would like to give<br/>\n  hime the chance to follow something. Everytime drop academis expectations I<br/>\n  get panicky he just hangs out in his room or on his bike and I don&#39;t even<br/>\n  see him. He is not interested in doing projects with abbie and I. Can<br/>\n  someone help talk me to me more about this. My head says he should be my<br/>\n  heart says  let go of those academic expectations. ( he reads well and is<br/>\n  good at math already) I hope this is not to long a diatribe. YOu all seem so<br/>\n  comfotable hanging out and following your kids leads. I can do that with<br/>\n  abbie because she is so curious but nikolas has me stumped.

This year i decided<br/>\nto do structured school with him using oak meadow 5th grade. he seemed to be<br/>\nneeding some structure because he was always upset and tense and seemed to<br/>\nbe asking for something but I wasn&#39;t sure what. well he doesn&#39;t like it, not<br/>\nat all. I am doing a lot of nagging on everything and restricting him if he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t do his work. (I know y&#39;all are cringing. He often has tantrums and<br/>\nis very reclcitrant. Yet when he finally does begin his work 90% of the time<br/>\nhe likes it is proud and says he likes doing it as says he wished he hadn&#39;t<br/>\nput up a fuss. but he almost always balks the next time. The reason I chose<br/>\nto be structured woth him is to give him a chance to work hard at something<br/>\nand stay with it. he avoids complicated projects, work, thinking etc. Or<br/>\nthis is the waty he seems to me. He likes to be very comfotable  and know<br/>\nsomething well before he might risk tryng something new. which happens only<br/>\nat urging. Anyway in my heart I am a true unschooler and would like to give<br/>\nhime the chance to follow something. Everytime drop academis expectations I<br/>\nget panicky he just hangs out in his room or on his bike and I don&#39;t even<br/>\nsee him. He is not interested in doing projects with abbie and I. Can<br/>\nsomeone help talk me to me more about this. My head says he should be my<br/>\nheart says  let go of those academic expectations. ( he reads well and is<br/>\ngood at math already) I hope this is not to long a diatribe. YOu all seem so<br/>\ncomfotable hanging out and following your kids leads. I can do that with<br/>\nabbie because she is so curious but nikolas has me stumped. Hubby also<br/>\nthinks work is very important. tahnk you for listening<br/>\nJosie   mom, worrier and closet control freak.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45930,"nextTopicId":46073}}
