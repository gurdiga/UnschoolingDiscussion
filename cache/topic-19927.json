I have read through <br/>\neveryone&#39;s posts on this and it does help me think about different ways of <br/>\ndoing things.  This whole issue is one that I&#39;m not firmly set on as far as <br/>\nour own methods.<br/>\n     I have at times gone with the method where I just tell everyone it&#39;s <br/>\ntime to clean for a while but my three older kids didn&#39;t like that because <br/>\nthey wanted the freedom to do the work when they wanted to.  I found that <br/>\neverything felt more free and relaxed when I just let them figure out when <br/>\nthey would do the work within the day or even which three days of the week <br/>\nthey wanted to do the main chores on.  They do help out a lot in smaller ways <br/>\nthat aren&#39;t accounted for in any way, like getting food or drink for a <br/>\nyounger brother sometimes.<br/>\n     Part of this may be different in families with a lot of kids.  I have <br/>\nfound that one of my kids will work really hard and fast to finish a chore <br/>\nand the other two will go pretty slowly or even stop a lot of times so it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem fair to have everyone race through housework for an hour but <br/>\nhave the main work fall on him and me.  And I don&#39;t want to have to keep <br/>\npolicing them so it seems easier for them to just pick out chores and get <br/>\nthem done on their own time.  If they choose not to do them and someone else <br/>\nhas to, it seems like there should be some kind of natural consequence but <br/>\nnot one that is overly harsh.  That&#39;s why I ended up tying it to weekly pay.  <br/>\nIf they want to have more time, they can skip the work and just not get as <br/>\nmuch money (which they sometimes choose to do).<br/>\n     To me, this kind of thing does seem to relate to real life as an adult.  <br/>\nIf we want more time than money, we choose to work less.  If we want people <br/>\nto do our share of domestic work, we have to pay them, as Eileen says.  I <br/>\nthink I will do it this way from now on, too...paying them the set amount at <br/>\nthe beginning of the week and then having them pay whoever does their share <br/>\nof the work if they decide not to.  But they usually don&#39;t have a big issue <br/>\nwith doing their share.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Lucy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"_Vj5euHSH6_wmWUgv-_zpvcKWS8Rwtb0A0tZmWJHBa8lTRrK_C7ga_oF0oXK6j-QocjLwpSQpMNEhDBODiyPm8CgtX8e04vAY9E2d2HnynPajvuhLA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Arthritis pain","postDate":"988493115","msgId":20020,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBRUI0MzRCLjM0NjcuMUVGMjNBRUBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDRiLmFiODU5ZWMuMjgxYzM0Y2RAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":20001,"nextInTopic":20083,"prevInTime":20019,"nextInTime":20021,"topicId":19927,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In labor I crushed a nerve which I can t spell (cyatic?\u000e Psyatic?\u000e Down the \u000f outside of my leg, to the top of my foot, someone spell, please; thanks).\u000e\u000f \u000f ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1301590475\">In labor I crushed a nerve which I can&#39;t spell <br/>\n(cyatic?\u000e Psyatic?\u000e Down the \u000f<br/>\noutside of my leg, to the top of my foot, someone <br/>\nspell, please; thanks).\u000e\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\nSandra\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\n<br/>\nSciatic, i think :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Vaughnde Edwards","from":"&quot;Vaughnde Edwards&quot; &lt;stampinbookworm@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"CvjV_IjmgpCVSeqeMdO5JyovttHzNrV9sk8DOvoXQKraGeY22MBtjHiJyOyWnKpFrdrqsyjDkf2fPsimdzgbQ9IaSCPfBjcaiLpV3_-tVgtI4RjxFAKbFos","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Arthritis pain","postDate":"988470428","msgId":20001,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTUwMWMwY2ZmNCRlNWRiNTNhMCQyNzY4YThjMEBqZXNzaWNhPg=="},"prevInTopic":19999,"nextInTopic":20020,"prevInTime":20000,"nextInTime":20002,"topicId":19927,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"sounds like it might be torn cartilage or muscles that isn t showing up real well on the xrays.

He just said that the xrays show arthritis forming.  He is an orthopaedic surgeon and is requesting a 2nd opinion and a nerve test because he can find no reason for the rest of the pain in my hand.  It is very intense in the area he &quot;sees&quot; the arthritis (I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m looking at) but the pain extends half way up my forearm and to my knuckles.  He says this is not characteristic of arthritis.  All this started when an airbag exploded while I was holding the steering wheel.  THANKS FOR ALL THE SUGGESTIONS.  ambersand<br/>\n  --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  What type have they diagnosed you with?  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Why a doc gave you pain meds for arthritis and nothing else is beyond me ... this was not<br/>\n  a rheumotologist I would hope - just a reg. MD, correct?  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I have had arthritis since I was 13 y/o and have it in every joint of my body.  However, I rarely<br/>\n  deal with pain anymore and when I do it is isolated to one or two joints at a time (Thank God)<br/>\n  What works from me is dependent on how bad it is at the time but here are some alternatives to try:<br/>\n<br/>\n  1) hot wax machine ($50 at the store) you dip your hand in perofin (Wax) and it does wonders:)<br/>\n  2) aleve - over the counter<br/>\n  3) take a lot of calcium, vit b and d<br/>\n  4) shark cartilidge is suppose to help with many forms of arthritis 5) I am not sure of spelling but panathentic acid .... take it regular to clean out system and boost immune<br/>\n<br/>\n  and ask doc about things like naproxen or other antiinflammatories instead of treating the pain with heavy meds<br/>\n  that wreck yer system tell him to fix the root cause with something easy on the system - inflammation causes <br/>\n  the pain (and the wreckage of joints)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I STRONGLY suggest one of those wax machines when arthritis is in your hands it feels like you have new hands when <br/>\n  you take them out - it is wonderful and sooooo soothing when the wax is on too<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~ Childhood is that state which ends<br/>\n  the moment a puddle is first viewed<br/>\n  as an obstacle instead of an opportunity. ~<br/>\n  - Kathy Williams -<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ------------------------ Yahoo!

At the same time, I <br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt;to confess that I can understand how the woman came up with a system like<br/>\n&gt;that.  I have tried to figure out the best way to deal with chores for <br/>\n&gt;years.<br/>\n&gt;  I don&#39;t think they&#39;re less pleasant just because we assign points or<br/>\n&gt;whatever to them and call them a chore whereas we call basketball fun.  I<br/>\n&gt;think they truly are less pleasant!<br/>\n&gt;      I posted on here one time before about making up chore cards for us <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;using them...having each kid pick 6 of them for 3 days out of the week<br/>\n&gt;(though sometimes we end up doing it only 1 or 2  days) and then I go <br/>\n&gt;through<br/>\n&gt;the ones I pull out and work through them as well.  It sounds regimented <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;most unschoolers, including me, tend to dislike regimentation.  But for us,<br/>\n&gt;this worked a lot better than trying to just clean as we go, as needed,<br/>\n&gt;because it seemed like only the same main things got done all the time and<br/>\n&gt;other things never got done.<br/>\n&gt;      I agree in principle that the kids should care about the housework <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;help with it simply because they live there, just like the adults.  <br/>\n&gt;However,<br/>\n&gt;I have found in practice that they have a really high tolerance for a mess,<br/>\n&gt;much higher than mine, and mine is pretty relaxed.  I have also found that<br/>\n&gt;they themselves feel better if we keep it fairly clean, especially if we <br/>\n&gt;find<br/>\n&gt;ways that seem fairly painless.<br/>\n&gt;      I think my main objection to her method would be that it sounds like <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;big hassle.  Also, I agree that the things the points are being redeemed <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;should be things the kids can do anyway.<br/>\n&gt;       What do you think about kids getting money of their own...should it <br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt;a set amount regardless of what they do or should it be based upon some <br/>\n&gt;sort<br/>\n&gt;of earning situation?  Right now ours is tied to the chore cards but I have<br/>\n&gt;done it the other way as well.  We have even done it where we figured out <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;total amount of spending money left at the end of the week or month and<br/>\n&gt;divided it up or got together to decide how to use it.  Surprisingly, my <br/>\n&gt;kids<br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t really like that method even though I liked the principle of it.<br/>\n&gt;      One thing we try to do is let each person do the chores he/she likes<br/>\n&gt;more.  Jonathan, my 12 year old, loves gardening so he doesn&#39;t mind <br/>\n&gt;watering<br/>\n&gt;the plants as one of his chores.

At the same time, I have <br/>\nto confess that I can understand how the woman came up with a system like <br/>\nthat.  I have tried to figure out the best way to deal with chores for years. <br/>\n I don&#39;t think they&#39;re less pleasant just because we assign points or <br/>\nwhatever to them and call them a chore whereas we call basketball fun.  I <br/>\nthink they truly are less pleasant!<br/>\n     I posted on here one time before about making up chore cards for us and <br/>\nusing them...having each kid pick 6 of them for 3 days out of the week <br/>\n(though sometimes we end up doing it only 1 or 2  days) and then I go through <br/>\nthe ones I pull out and work through them as well.  It sounds regimented and <br/>\nmost unschoolers, including me, tend to dislike regimentation.  But for us, <br/>\nthis worked a lot better than trying to just clean as we go, as needed, <br/>\nbecause it seemed like only the same main things got done all the time and <br/>\nother things never got done.  <br/>\n     I agree in principle that the kids should care about the housework and <br/>\nhelp with it simply because they live there, just like the adults.  However, <br/>\nI have found in practice that they have a really high tolerance for a mess, <br/>\nmuch higher than mine, and mine is pretty relaxed.  I have also found that <br/>\nthey themselves feel better if we keep it fairly clean, especially if we find <br/>\nways that seem fairly painless.<br/>\n     I think my main objection to her method would be that it sounds like a <br/>\nbig hassle.  Also, I agree that the things the points are being redeemed for <br/>\nshould be things the kids can do anyway. <br/>\n      What do you think about kids getting money of their own...should it be <br/>\na set amount regardless of what they do or should it be based upon some sort <br/>\nof earning situation?  Right now ours is tied to the chore cards but I have <br/>\ndone it the other way as well.  We have even done it where we figured out the <br/>\ntotal amount of spending money left at the end of the week or month and <br/>\ndivided it up or got together to decide how to use it.  Surprisingly, my kids <br/>\ndidn&#39;t really like that method even though I liked the principle of it.<br/>\n     One thing we try to do is let each person do the chores he/she likes <br/>\nmore.  Jonathan, my 12 year old, loves gardening so he doesn&#39;t mind watering <br/>\nthe plants as one of his chores.  Even with those we don&#39;t love, there will <br/>\nbe one person who hates cleaning the bathroom and another one who doesn&#39;t <br/>\nthink it&#39;s that bad but hates sweeping (we have a lot of sweeping because our <br/>\nhouse is all tile and wood floors and we live in a dusty area).  The chore <br/>\ncards give them the chance to pick out what they want.  We take turns picking <br/>\nand take turns with who gets to have first pick.<br/>\n     Hope you don&#39;t think my logic is screwed up as well....just trying to be <br/>\nhonest...<br/>\n<br/>\n       Lucy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Judie C.

Do you bribe your husband too? 80 points equals the<br/>\nmissionary positions, 100 points for a oral sex?<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Don&#39;t your kids deserve to go to football games or<br/>\nhave friends over without having to earn the<br/>\nprivilege?<br/>\n<br/>\n8. How many points do they get for flushing the toilet<br/>\nor breathing or going to the library?<br/>\n<br/>\n9. You&#39;re teaching your kids that keeping your home<br/>\nnice is a dreadful chore that can only be borne with<br/>\nthe right reward. How about giving them 50 points for<br/>\nplaying basketball and letting them turn that in for<br/>\nthe privilege of vacuuming.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. Why are the traditionally female jobs only 10<br/>\npoints while the stereotypically male job of mowing<br/>\nthe lawn is 70 points. I&#39;d like to know who does which<br/>\nchores in your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny more questions? Fling them my way. I want to write<br/>\nto the editor with this response.
