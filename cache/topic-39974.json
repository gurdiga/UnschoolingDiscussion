In baking these delicious <br/>\n  treats to honor the three Kings, the cakes were made circular to <br/>\n  portray the circular route taken by the kings to confuse King Herod, <br/>\n  who was trying to follow the wise men so he could kill the Christ <br/>\n  Child. <br/>\n  In these early days, a bean, a pea or a coin was hidden inside the <br/>\n  cake and who ever got the hidden item in their piece of cake was <br/>\n  declared King for a day, or was said to have good luck in the coming <br/>\n  year. In Louisiana, Twelfth Night (Jan. 6th) signifies the beginning <br/>\n  of our carnival season and the bean, pea or coin has been replaced by <br/>\n  a small baby which symbolizes the Christ Child. Today, the person <br/>\n  getting the baby is expected to host the next King Cake party. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  So here we have a connnection between 12th night, Mardi Gras and <br/>\n  Three Kings holidays. Who would&#39;ve guessed? The things you can learn <br/>\n  at unschooling.com and google.<br/>\n  I love finding the connections, the dot-to-dot learning style it <br/>\n  should be called.<br/>\n  And here it says the roots are in 12th century France, so now we can <br/>\n  learn about medieval customs, France, traditional recipes, <br/>\n  religion......and so it goes. Everything in the whole wide world and <br/>\n  how it connects. The best thing about being an unschooler is seeing <br/>\n  how one thing leads to another....
