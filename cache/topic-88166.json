My neighbor had a blind date. The<br/>\nguy said he&#39;d pay for a taxi there and back. She asked me if I could take<br/>\nher out there to save him the money. So I did. Which made us late for church<br/>\n(neighbor&#39;s daughter routinely comes with us).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She&#39;d asked how late she could call me for a ride home after the date. I<br/>\nasked her to call me by 2300, because normally the kids were settling in for<br/>\nthe night by then. At 2130 she called. I said we&#39;d be on our way in half an<br/>\nhour, since the kids had JUST poured bowls of cereal to eat as they&#39;d not<br/>\neaten much at the fellowship dinner before church.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We had just left to go get her at 2200 when she called and said don&#39;t<br/>\nworry about it, she&#39;d gotten a ride home.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I THOUGHT she was on her way. By midnight, the kids were finally asleep.<br/>\nAt 0045 she FINALLY calls to say she&#39;s home, but since it&#39;s freezing cold<br/>\nout she&#39;ll come get her daughter in the morning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I told her I&#39;d leave the back door unlocked so she could just come on in,<br/>\nwe&#39;d still be sleeping at the time she&#39;d need to come get her daughter so<br/>\nshe could get ready to catch the school bus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sometime just after 0700, I become aware that the phone is ringing. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t get to it in time, so I just bring it into my room with me. At 0800 it<br/>\nrings again. My neighbor. Upset because I didn&#39;t bring her child home and<br/>\nthe bus was due shortly. I said come on over and get her, everyone&#39;s still<br/>\nasleep. She said she&#39;d miss the bus, I said so let her stay home (she lets<br/>\nher child stay home for no reason at all most of the time anyway!) and she<br/>\nsays &quot;My child isn&#39;t like your kids, she HAS to go to school and whenever<br/>\nshe&#39;s late or anything they look at ME like there&#39;s something wrong with me<br/>\nfor not getting her to school.&quot; I said, Fine. Bring her clothes over, watch<br/>\nmy children (who are all SLEEPING) and I&#39;ll drive her to school. She says<br/>\n&quot;No, just wake her up and have her run home, she has to catch the bus.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not the one staying up til one am yet it&#39;s MY fault her child might<br/>\nmiss the bus?! I drive her halfway across Cape Cod for this date and she<br/>\ncan&#39;t watch my children for ten minutes so I can take HER daughter to<br/>\nschool?!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ARGGG!!! So that&#39;s just this morning. I get up, get the house all picked<br/>\nup for the social worker&#39;s visit that was scheduled for noon. I&#39;m not<br/>\ndressed yet. She arrives at 1130. More pressure to put Logan in Head Start,<br/>\nand she&#39;ll look into part-time daycare for Megan so I can get a break and<br/>\nwhat about that parent-aide coming in?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She leaves, we have lunch, and I head to the bathroom with diahrrea. I<br/>\ncome out to find Sarah sitting on the table with the baby, Megan at the<br/>\nbottom of the basement stairs crying, and Logan using the last of my<br/>\ndishsoap after pouring out half the bottle so he can &quot;wash the dishes&quot; for<br/>\nme from lunch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I go into the living room and find that the box of math manipulatives has<br/>\nbeen dumped out and the pieces thrown around the room.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m about ready to throw in the dang towel! I&#39;m exhausted and I WANT A<br/>\nSHOWER! By the time I knew my neighbor wasn&#39;t going to be here I&#39;d already<br/>\nfallen asleep on the recliner while waiting for her. Megan was already awake<br/>\nthis morning when I got up so no chance for a shower.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only child who naps is Gracie, so no chance for a nap there...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why not?!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

Paul and I have been talking and tomorrow he is going to tell her that that latest either of us will take her anywhere is going to be 8 pm with at least half an hour&#39;s notice (quite often things have been last minute). He&#39;s been feeling the same about the whole situation. 2300 for her to come and pick up her child if she&#39;s gone out, and going out means her date provides her ride. No more of the 0100 (or later!!). We will watch her child because we want that child to be safe, but that&#39;s it. <br/>\n <br/>\nSIGH....yes, I&#39;ve let this person interfere with how things should be with my kids. In that regard, I suppose you could say that I have been a failure as a mom. :-(   <br/>\n <br/>\n And no, we&#39;re not getting ANYTHING in return from her other than that she did allow us to dry clothes at her place, which we did our best to not do more than a couple loads a week at her place. When I&#39;ve REALLY needed help, she&#39;d say no, especially if it meant watching any of my children. She did that once for an hour and decided my kids were &quot;undisciplined brats.&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\nThis lady is bringing out the worst in me, and I don&#39;t like it. I did tell her no earlier today, when she wanted to just run up to the corner store (about a mile and a half and a couple corners away really...so I&#39;m saying corner meaning the main corner of that end of town) for cigarettes. I sold her one of Paul&#39;s packs instead. It&#39;s easier than having to get all four children bundled up and into a van that doesn&#39;t heat up when idling! <br/>\n <br/>\nTomorrow I&#39;m planning on actually attending the parenting class at a local church that I&#39;d signed up for and hardly attended in Nov/Dec between the holidays, migraines, and &quot;helping&quot; this neighbor. It&#39;s earlier in the day than I&#39;d like, but there is child-care and the opportunity to sit and relax! By the time we&#39;d get home it&#39;d be nearly noon..then it&#39;d be time to meet up with some people from our local homeschooling group at the library. So I can manage to be gone most of the day. I hate having to avoid someone, but it looks like I might need to in order to help me to say &quot;No&quot; to her! <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, thanks Pam for that encouragement..I needed to hear that as well!<br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n <br/>\npam sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jan 8, 2004, at 10:40 AM, Elizabeth Roberts wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If anyone is in an encouraging mood, I could use some encouraging!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI encourage you to learn to say &quot;No,&quot; Elizabeth.

A couple times, he&#39;d also let Megan (2) out with him. <br/>\n <br/>\nI didn&#39;t like taking them out during the heat of the day, we&#39;d go out in the morning or late afternoon. But typical boy, he wanted to live outside. He&#39;s only three, so he can&#39;t be outside &quot;unsupervised.&quot; (we weren&#39;t unschoolers then by the way).<br/>\n <br/>\nMy next door neighbor and I don&#39;t get along, and she called DSS. Because I&#39;d left the kids in the car once while I ran into the commissary (literally only in there for three minutes, timed myself on my watch) DSS considers me to have a &quot;history&quot; of &quot;neglect.&quot; There was also a call by the school system for &quot;educational and mental health neglect&quot; from when Sarah was in Kindergarten. Long story short, she was on medication for ADHD. We wanted her off of it, the school said neglect if we took her off without her psych&#39;s permission. They also insisted that she also had OCD, ODD, and Asperger&#39;s. They wanted her tested but we said no. These conditions only manifested while she was on the medications. She couldn&#39;t eat and couldn&#39;t sleep, and was becoming very aggressive. When we refused the testing and took her off the medications anyway, they called DSS. DSS backed them up. The school year ended during the assessment period, we immediately filed to homeschool the following year. But DSS<br/>\n insisted that we have the testing done, and continue her IEP with the school for her speech therapy unless/until we find another source.<br/>\n <br/>\nSO that in a nutshell is why I have a social worker coming by once a month. Probably for the next 15 months until our next transfer, although possibly they&#39;ll close it out in another couple months. It will depend on this worker.

My neighbor had a blind date. The guy said he&#39;d pay for a taxi there and back. She asked me if I could take her out there to save him the money. So I did. Which made us late for church (neighbor&#39;s daughter routinely comes with us). <br/>\n <br/>\nShe&#39;d asked how late she could call me for a ride home after the date. I asked her to call me by 2300, because normally the kids were settling in for the night by then. At 2130 she called. I said we&#39;d be on our way in half an hour, since the kids had JUST poured bowls of cereal to eat as they&#39;d not eaten much at the fellowship dinner before church. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe had just left to go get her at 2200 when she called and said don&#39;t worry about it, she&#39;d gotten a ride home. <br/>\n <br/>\nI THOUGHT she was on her way. By midnight, the kids were finally asleep. At 0045 she FINALLY calls to say she&#39;s home, but since it&#39;s freezing cold out she&#39;ll come get her daughter in the morning. <br/>\n <br/>\nI told her I&#39;d leave the back door unlocked so she could just come on in, we&#39;d still be sleeping at the time she&#39;d need to come get her daughter so she could get ready to catch the school bus. <br/>\n <br/>\nSometime just after 0700, I become aware that the phone is ringing. I don&#39;t get to it in time, so I just bring it into my room with me. At 0800 it rings again. My neighbor. Upset because I didn&#39;t bring her child home and the bus was due shortly. I said come on over and get her, everyone&#39;s still asleep. She said she&#39;d miss the bus, I said so let her stay home (she lets her child stay home for no reason at all most of the time anyway!) and she says &quot;My child isn&#39;t like your kids, she HAS to go to school and whenever she&#39;s late or anything they look at ME like there&#39;s something wrong with me for not getting her to school.&quot; I said, Fine. Bring her clothes over, watch my children (who are all SLEEPING) and I&#39;ll drive her to school. She says &quot;No, just wake her up and have her run home, she has to catch the bus.&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m not the one staying up til one am yet it&#39;s MY fault her child might miss the bus?! I drive her halfway across Cape Cod for this date and she can&#39;t watch my children for ten minutes so I can take HER daughter to school?! <br/>\n <br/>\nARGGG!!! So that&#39;s just this morning. I get up, get the house all picked up for the social worker&#39;s visit that was scheduled for noon. I&#39;m not dressed yet. She arrives at 1130. More pressure to put Logan in Head Start, and she&#39;ll look into part-time daycare for Megan so I can get a break and what about that parent-aide coming in? <br/>\n <br/>\nShe leaves, we have lunch, and I head to the bathroom with diahrrea. I come out to find Sarah sitting on the table with the baby, Megan at the bottom of the basement stairs crying, and Logan using the last of my dishsoap after pouring out half the bottle so he can &quot;wash the dishes&quot; for me from lunch. <br/>\n <br/>\nI go into the living room and find that the box of math manipulatives has been dumped out and the pieces thrown around the room. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m about ready to throw in the dang towel! I&#39;m exhausted and I WANT A SHOWER! By the time I knew my neighbor wasn&#39;t going to be here I&#39;d already fallen asleep on the recliner while waiting for her. Megan was already awake this morning when I got up so no chance for a shower. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe only child who naps is Gracie, so no chance for a nap there...<br/>\n <br/>\nGRR the neighbor just came in..gotta go...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not?!<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
