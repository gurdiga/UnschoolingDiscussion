Wow, the <br/>\npower of words!  That really hits home how powerful is language.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s really just so amazing what words do to us.  It seems to me <br/>\nthat it is one thing if someone shouts a distasteful word at you.  <br/>\nIn that case, the power behind the word is also that person&#39;s energy <br/>\npropelling the word at you.  Often just that alone will cause you to <br/>\nreact.  I mean, if someone says f*** you, and means it, they usually <br/>\nhave a lot of energy and emotion packed into that and it hits you <br/>\nhard.  But here, on this e-mail list, we have simply been pointing <br/>\nout words, in e-mail format, no less.  No sound bites or anything.  <br/>\nJust a list of words.  Where&#39;s the energy?  Email is getting very <br/>\npowerful, isn&#39;t it?  In this case, with the cuss words, no one was <br/>\nactually directing them at a single soul.  Just pointing out words <br/>\nthat, if someone were new to this planet, or in this case, new to <br/>\nthis country, they might consider with care before directing at <br/>\nanyone.  I found it to be pretty much like a guide book -- &quot;when in <br/>\nAmerica, do not say this&quot; type thing.  Not offensive in the least.  <br/>\nIn a very real way, it&#39;s the same kind of recommendation we would <br/>\noffer to a child -- &quot;here are a list of words that are out there, <br/>\nthat you might consider carefully before using.  In all likelihood <br/>\nyou would very much offend someone if you directed any one of them <br/>\nat someone personally.&quot;  Not actually commanding them not to say <br/>\nsomething.  Just pointing out what is.  You can find pretty much all <br/>\nof the words I saw listed here in an unabridged dictionary, can&#39;t <br/>\nyou?  Or at least a dictionary that includes American slang.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s no emotion packed behind them.  Why would someone react so <br/>\nstrongly to a written word that is simply within a whole list of <br/>\nwords?  That, I find very curious.  If language is such that it can <br/>\ncause people to get all in a hullaballoo, there is power!  Imagine <br/>\nwhat you can do with your words!  You can write stuff down and <br/>\nreally affect people.  Even in just a list form, it appears.  It <br/>\noccurs to me that email has become as real as saying something to <br/>\nsomeone in person.  Maybe even more so, if people can get so <br/>\naggitated by words not even spoken aloud.  They are imagining the <br/>\nwords out loud!  THAT is powerful.  Wow!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this particular thread, for the above reasons, was rather <br/>\nenlightening for me.  I feel I got a little bit of learning there.  <br/>\nRather than condemn the folks who brought it forth, I&#39;d like to say <br/>\nthanks.
