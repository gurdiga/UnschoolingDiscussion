The jury is still out on the <br/>\nLupus diagnosis.  I test highly positive but don&#39;t have enough (or strong <br/>\nenough) markers for the rheumatologist (sp?) to call it Lupus.  So I&#39;m in a <br/>\nholding pattern and we are treating me as if for FMS only.  If Lupus is <br/>\ninvolved, it is SLE.  Sjogren&#39;s Syndrome is also considered a high <br/>\npossibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust yesterday DH decided I need to start learning to conserve my energy a <br/>\nlittle better.  We were shopping.  Finished the Costco trip (not a big one, <br/>\nthank goodness!) and I was exhausted.  But there were a couple of items that <br/>\nI really wanted to get at a regular grocery store.  He wouldn&#39;t even drive <br/>\nthe car into the parking lot unless I agreed to use a wheelchair shopping <br/>\ncart!  The stinker.  Gotta love him.  Just hate admitting he is right about <br/>\nthings like this.  Anyway, we found a cart that had handles and a bench seat <br/>\nthat was adult size, but not motorized (my brain power wasn&#39;t up to learning <br/>\nhow to drive the motorized one!) and he had lots of fun pushing me around the <br/>\nstore.  Me, I was mortified, but I&#39;ll get over it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got a handicapped parking permit recently and it took DH parking in the <br/>\nhandicapped spot when he took me places to start training me that it really <br/>\nwas okay to use those spots, too.  Now, I don&#39;t know how I&#39;ve gone all these <br/>\nyears without it.  It makes such a difference.  It&#39;s gotten to the point that <br/>\nif there isn&#39;t a handicapped spot or one just as close, I skip that store.  <br/>\n(oops!  Didn&#39;t mean to go on quite so much.  But, I&#39;m glad that this is a <br/>\nlist where it&#39;s okay to have a life and we&#39;re not strictly limited to <br/>\neducation issues!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for asking.  I hope you aren&#39;t having as much trouble with it as I am <br/>\nright now.  OTOH, it has forced me to be a SAHM and unschool, both of which <br/>\nare very important to me!  (I suppose I &#39;could&#39; put him in ps, but it&#39;s not <br/>\nworth the anxiety I feel every time I even contemplate THAT idea...so, we are <br/>\nhomeschoolers and rapidly learning to LOVE unschooling!)<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW,<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"HWE3L47Zd8XcdiIvcArYBY4YNLgCsUDJKQhKt0unoeOk63G_lAoS01CgipkC1y5bnU78DrJdKnLzbkCjwdiSTgFk5Q","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: only kids","postDate":"964330239","msgId":11487,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNzIzMDYyNy5lNk42UjJkMTM1NDVAc20wMTAxLnByb21lZGlhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":11478,"nextInTopic":11488,"prevInTime":11486,"nextInTime":11488,"topicId":11470,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"All convo s (aka nursing homes) have activity directors or social services directors.
