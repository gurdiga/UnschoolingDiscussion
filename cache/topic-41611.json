It might make other homeschoolers look bad by comparison; it might<br/>\nmake the state raise the standards for all homeschoolers; if the children do<br/>\npoorly, it can give the state reason to think it should make homeschooling<br/>\nmore restricted and burdensome;  it might give the state reason to believe<br/>\nthat you think testing is great for children, when it&#39;s not, so they might<br/>\nincrease their testing for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy doing what the state wants you to do invites them to make you even MORE<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are NO good reasons for having children tested by the state. If you<br/>\nwant your kids tested, or if they want to be tested, do it privately. You&#39;ll<br/>\nget fair tests, and correct results, and promptly.
