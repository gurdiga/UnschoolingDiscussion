We&#39;ve begun rewarding both schools and<br/>\nteachers whose kids test above average on these tests.  So, as you can<br/>\nimagine, everything that kids learn here from K to 3rd is geared to help<br/>\nthem take the test.  So . . . a friend of mine recently told me that her<br/>\nson, who is in kindergarten, had been given an IQ test and behavior test<br/>\nat school without her consent .  Then, they called my friend in and told<br/>\nher they believed her son might benefit from Ritalin.  When she asked<br/>\nwhat his exact problems in class were, the teacher explained that he<br/>\nwasn&#39;t sitting still during group time and wasn&#39;t filling out his<br/>\nworksheets completely.  My friend asked whether this was really a<br/>\nproblem in KINDERGARTEN, and the teacher said yes, that if he didn&#39;t get<br/>\na grip on his &quot;ADD&quot; that he might not do well on his 3rd grade<br/>\nstandardized test.  Things like that really make me want to scream!<br/>\n<br/>\nKerry in NC</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6770,"nextTopicId":6742}}
