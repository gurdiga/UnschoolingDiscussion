Tried it with my kid and it didn&#39;t work. My son <br/>\ndidn&#39;t go in the water, even with all the flotation devices and cool <br/>\ntoys we bought, until he was 4 1/2 and started swimming lessons. Our <br/>\nwhole family would go to the pool and he would sit on the side. We <br/>\nspent entire vacations in Hawaii and Florida with him not going in <br/>\nthe pool. Swimming lessons freed him to swim, and now he is an <br/>\namazing little fish. Dives to the bottom (taught himself that one, <br/>\ntoo!). For a kid with SID (sensory integration dysfunction), that <br/>\nmade him very averse to the water to start with, to a kid who can not <br/>\nonly get his face wet but submerge himself totally, we&#39;ve been pretty <br/>\namazed at the progress he&#39;s made with a good teacher. Progress he <br/>\nabsolutely wasn&#39;t about to attempt on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We own a pool, and are worried about drowning.  My wife tried <br/>\n&gt; to take our daughter, Serena, to swimming lessons, and Serena did <br/>\n </span></blockquote>NOT like <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; them.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s a different situation. My kids both love swimming <br/>\nlessons, and they&#39;ve had a great teacher. Recently, when my son said <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t want to do them anymore, I respected that and he quit, mid-<br/>\nsession.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  So, instead of formal swimming lessons, we just took her into the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>pool. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Our pool has a large shallow end, about 3 feet deep. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s great. I wish we could have a pool of our own, might <br/>\nmake it a bit easier to unschool something like that. As it was, we <br/>\nwere paying to go the pool every week to have our son sit on the <br/>\nside, for many years. For us, this was the one scenario where <br/>\nunschooling the subject wasn&#39;t &quot;working&quot;. And the obvious reason it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t working was that our kid wasn&#39;t going to go into the water in <br/>\nthe timeframe that I wanted him to. Like I said, if I&#39;d been patient, <br/>\nmaybe he would&#39;ve done it at 6 or 8 or 10 years old. That&#39;s the <br/>\nunschooling philosophy - that patience. But if you ask me, <br/>\nunschooling only works if you&#39;re willing to have that patience, and I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t willing to WRT something I consider a safety issue. And I&#39;m <br/>\nglad we were able to find a teacher who could gently encourage him to <br/>\ngive the water a try. Now he begs to go swimming!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One thing I notice about her, versus kids that have taken swim <br/>\n </span></blockquote>lessons, is <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that she doesn&#39;t limit herself artificially.  One of her friends <br/>\n </span></blockquote>doesn&#39;t <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; dive to the bottom because &quot;her teacher hasn&#39;t shown her that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>yet&quot;,  while <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Serena happily swims on the bottom!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe that&#39;s just a hallmark of non-unschooled kids in general. As my <br/>\nkids are unschooled in every other aspect of learning, they have no <br/>\nproblems doing things that they haven&#39;t been taught. They tend to see <br/>\ntheir swimming teacher as a jumping-off point, so to speak. Since <br/>\nbeginning lessons, my son has taught himself to swim underwater, <br/>\ntaught himself to jump and dive in from the edge too. It&#39;s funny, <br/>\nbecause she gives these little report card thingies that tells what <br/>\nhe&#39;s able to do, and I told her he could do half the stuff that she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t check off. She was surprised. And of course, that was just <br/>\nbefore he asked to quit. I think he realized he&#39;d outlived the <br/>\nusefulness of having her as a teacher. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith my daughter, I wouldn&#39;t have started her in lessons for another <br/>\nyear or two, but she begged for them when her older brother started <br/>\ngoing. Now that he quit, she still says she wants to go. I guess that <br/>\npart of it is unschooling after all. She&#39;s much more the type to just <br/>\nwant to get in the water and swim, so I don&#39;t really worry about her <br/>\nlearning it at all. We had to get her a floatie as a 1 year old, <br/>\nbecause she would toddle up to the edge of the pool and just fling <br/>\nherself in! <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to reiterate that I don&#39;t see any reason why anyone *has to* <br/>\nunschool swimming. My comment was just that I *chose* to based on the <br/>\nfact that my son did not seem to be naturally coming to it on his <br/>\nown, and it was important enough to me to subvert his natural <br/>\ntimeline and have him learn it via lessons. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a personal swimming coach (mostly for triathlons), I have taught <br/>\nadult swimmers who have never learned to swim as children. Quite <br/>\noften, I have to start at the point of having them put their face in <br/>\nthe water and blow bubbles, or deal with panic attacks at the very <br/>\nthought of water. Swimming is one of the things that very few people <br/>\nlearn to do well as children. Even people who &quot;know how to swim&quot; are <br/>\nnot strong enough swimmers to avert a catastrophe if they fell in a <br/>\nriver or into the middle of a lake, especially with clothing on. This <br/>\nis one area that I wanted to make sure my kids picked up, for their <br/>\nown safety. I&#39;ve rescued both kids and adults from near-drowning <br/>\nsituations. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that doesn&#39;t mean I think it&#39;s mandatory for all unschoolers, <br/>\nthat&#39;s just the way i chose to do it for my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":108219631,"authorName":"kevin.tucker@microchip.com","from":"kevin.tucker@...","profile":"kevintucker21899","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"(Was: Is Unschooling A Transformation?)
