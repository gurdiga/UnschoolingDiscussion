My son had cereal, yogurt, and gummies for breakfast.<br/>\nThat would NEVER have happened before.  He did not eat till 10:30, and<br/>\nbreakfast time is usually around 8:00.  Now he is at the table eating<br/>\npeanuts dipped in apple sauce, yuck!!!  This is lunch for him, again, never<br/>\nbefore.  It is what he wants, so I am letting him have it.  I feel, now,<br/>\nthat he is making some healthy choices, and that is enough for me.  He is<br/>\nhappy and that is what really matters.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI borrowed this from the food post. All the unschoolers I have known have<br/>\nbeen unschoolers before I met them.
