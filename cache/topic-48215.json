I work at<br/>\nhome and tend to only post when I have the time or something has really gotten<br/>\nto me. And part reply to Myranda, who is concerned about the responses of some<br/>\non this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Cherry.  I&#39;m 29, a wahm mother to 1 son, Caesar.  I was introduced<br/>\nto unschooling by my friend Beth Ali, she&#39;s also on this list.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe subject reads overwhelmed because I&#39;m very busy with work right now and<br/>\nI&#39;ve had to read almost 100 posts in one sitting.  Many of the posts made me<br/>\ncry.  They bring up painful memories.  The subject reads appreciative because<br/>\nthey provided an opening for me and my husband to have a really great<br/>\ndiscussion this morning and because they gave me a sense of hope.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m very grateful for Sandra and Ren and others who are willing to be brutally<br/>\nhonest about the revulsion they feel about abuse.  Neither my husband or I had<br/>\npeople in our lives willing to stand up for us.  I was sexually abused by my<br/>\nfather and he was beaten by his.  In my family no one ever said I was a liar<br/>\nor denied the abuse but they also never took my father to task about the<br/>\nabuse.  Everyone continued to treat him as if he was a decent human being. <br/>\nUntil this morning my husband had never said that he feels anger at his<br/>\nmother, who never hit him, but did condone his abuse by not stopping it.  We<br/>\nboth felt like no one really cared that we had been hurt.  I think it led us<br/>\nto excuse alot of abusive, coercive behavior in people.  For both of us our<br/>\nabuse ended when we vehemently said no to our abusers.  I remember so clearly<br/>\nbeing at the kitchen sink and my father coming up behind me and touching me. <br/>\nIt was primal instinct more than anything that made me push him off of me and<br/>\nstart screaming no.  My husband says his father was beating him with a broom<br/>\nstick, which broke.  He picked up a piece of the stick and threw it at him. <br/>\nHe said he&#39;ll never forget how shocked his father looked. <br/>\n <br/>\nSometimes a voracious, no pussy-footing around NO is what&#39;s needed to stop<br/>\nabuse.  Abuse is not nice or gentle or kind and the response to it can&#39;t be<br/>\nnice or gentle or kind.  Brutal honesty, like all things can be used for good<br/>\nor bad, in the case of the posters on this board I believe it&#39;s being used for<br/>\ngood.  Take intentions into account before criticizing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand the desire to understand and accept people and give positive<br/>\nresponses (I&#39;m a Sagittarius ;-)  But it can&#39;t be at the expense of an<br/>\ninnocent child&#39;s well-being.  And no matter how many ways the christians try<br/>\nto spin it spanking diminishes the spirit.  People who spank should not expect<br/>\npositive or gentle responses to them or their discipline choices when they do<br/>\nnot give positive or gentle responses to their own children.  My own parents<br/>\ndid not give beating-type spankings, they would hit us on an open hand with a<br/>\nwooden paddle.  But it put fear and mis-trust in us.  Even before I was<br/>\nmolested there was a dark cloud on me and my family because of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCherry in GA<br/>\n<br/>\nPS-I also want to add that my belief that children choose their parents<br/>\nhappened because I was a very promiscious teenager and I never got pregnant<br/>\n(never got stds either)  I even had a boyfriend (who had children with other<br/>\nwomen) ask me why I didn&#39;t get pregnant.  I&#39;ve been pregnant twice by my<br/>\nhusband, the first time I miscarried.  When our son was born I had a strange<br/>\nsense that he was the same spirit that had been with us before and he was now<br/>\nchoosing to be with us because the time was right.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48349,"nextTopicId":47042}}
