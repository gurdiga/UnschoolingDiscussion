These are called ALE - Alternative Learning Experience.  The students enrolled are considered Full-Time Public School Students and are required to follow the rules of the program.  The child&#39;s education is planned in consultation with a school district employee.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a child participates in the ALE program, his/her records are the property of the state.  You can be sure that these programs require testing!  Plus, it is one day per week for the school year, not just &quot;one day&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder Washington state&#39;s Home-Based Instruction  statutes, (aka homeschooling) the results of the annual test/assessment are for the parent&#39;s use.  We are not required to share the results with anybody.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;THE STATE REQUIRES TESTING&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>FALSE.  Annual testing OR assessment is required.  I do a mail order assessment through www.familylearning.org and it is relatively painless ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m just too wimpy to stop following the law.  It really is painless to fill out a form with the school district that has only my child&#39;s name and age and states that I am responsible for their education.  The annual assessment is a bit of a burden, primarily because I have to pay to get the required official signature on it.  My kids do not participate in the assessement.  It is something I write, not something they have to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very easy to unschool in Washington state, whether you follow the law or not.  The law gives the parent total responsibility over methods, timing, philosophy, and curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":114490997,"authorName":"TheFadels@aol.com","from":"TheFadels@...","profile":"madrahci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] information on Washington unschooling, please","postDate":"1130743825","msgId":109210,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExMC41NWMxNDI1ZS4zMDk3MjIxMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":109204,"nextInTopic":109213,"prevInTime":109209,"nextInTime":109211,"topicId":109138,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I HAVE A FRIEND IN SPOKANE AND THEY HAVE A GREAT PROGRAM FOR HOMESCHOOLERS THROUGH THE SCHOOLS.
