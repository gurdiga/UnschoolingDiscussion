We  <br/>\nhad Dorothy for 5 years and we got her from a family that was divorcing. Best  <br/>\ndog we ever had! <br/>\n <br/>\nOn another dog note, we now have a Chocolate Lab/German Shepherd who is 5.  <br/>\nShe had a seizure the other day and scared us all, we thought she was dying!  <br/>\nTurns out the retreiver family of dogs is known for having seizure/epilepsy  <br/>\nproblems. Anyway, she is fine now, the whole thing only lasted a couple of  <br/>\nminutes. We have had her since she was 5 weeks old so we are praying that this  is <br/>\none of those once in a very long while things. In the meantime, we have had  <br/>\nlots of visits to the vet, but she is worth it. <br/>\n <br/>\nOne note on training. One of the best ways to train a dog/puppy is to get a  <br/>\nleash that you can clip on your belt loop. You keep the dog with you all of <br/>\nthe  time except when you let them out and crate them at night. After about 3-4 <br/>\nweeks  of this you should have a well trained dog that will always stay by <br/>\nyour side.  Make sure to give commands each time you need to get up or sit down <br/>\nand praise  when they obey. I NEVER EVER use hitting or abuse of any kind, not <br/>\neven a raised  voice.<br/>\n <br/>\nLove reading all of the posts!<br/>\n <br/>\nHeather - Wisconsin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100743,"nextTopicId":100724}}
