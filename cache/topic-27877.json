The relationship may be to the chemicals that are in &quot;our&quot; soy<br/>\nproducts and relatively unseen in &quot;their&quot; soy products.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also another study being done that appears at this time to indicate<br/>\nthat what may work for some ethnic groups will not work as well for other<br/>\nethnic groups.  The reasoning behind that is that in certain ethnic groups<br/>\nthere is no history of a certain food product being &quot;unknown&quot; and not being<br/>\npart of the diet for thousands of years thus when it is introduced it is<br/>\nsomething the body sometimes see as an &quot;enemy&quot; or the body doesn&#39;t know how<br/>\nto react to it or properly process it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a high incidence of obesity and diabetes in the First Nations<br/>\npeoples.  The rates are double and in some areas even higher than that of<br/>\nthe &quot;white&quot; population.  The link appears to be &quot;commodities&quot; foods.
