I now feel normal and ok and that I&#39;m not <br/>\nacting strange with this new unschooling venture.  I can see why <br/>\npeople don&#39;t do this and stick with the tried and true Public and <br/>\nPrivate Schools.  I was in Trader Joes today (alone, DH was with <br/>\nkids) and I heard these two women agonizing over which preschool <br/>\ntheir kids were going too, the ratios, the teachers, the area, what <br/>\nthey taught.  It brought back memories or me and my friends doing <br/>\nthat and then I look back and think &quot;what a waste of my time to worry <br/>\nabout all that&quot;.  Which is probably what I&#39;ll think when the worry <br/>\nabout whether I&#39;m unschooling &quot;correctly&quot; passes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., Kasie &lt;mrscalgal@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have been one of the silent ones.

They watch t.v. <br/>\nthey go on the computer, they play board games and card games, they <br/>\nplay paint ball (yes with paint ball guns), they ride bikes and <br/>\nrollerblade, they swim, they do arts and crafts, my daughter plays <br/>\nthe violin (only when she feels like it no more forced lessons!) My <br/>\nson plays the guitar and writes music. And my daughter at 12 still <br/>\nlikes to play dress up and play with dolls and Barbies. My 17 year <br/>\nold is also working. His choice! It supports his music! He is the one <br/>\nyou all helped me with when he changed his mind on taking music <br/>\nclasses at the college. You all have been such great support and I <br/>\nreally appreciate the input from all of you! And yes I make my kids <br/>\ndo chores! and I do yell at them when they dont!!!
