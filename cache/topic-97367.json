I googled &quot;Minimum legal drinking age&quot; and discovered a wealth of<br/>\ninformation, history, opinion, bias, statistics skewed in all directions and<br/>\na general huge labrynthian controversy, as is probably typical of any public<br/>\npolicy issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe vast majority of it focuses on drinking and driving, and the many<br/>\nwebsites seem to focus on preventing collegiate underage drinking. Medical<br/>\nwebsites focus on medical statistics, public policy sites focus on attempts<br/>\nat the big picture federally and internationally, youth sites focus on<br/>\nrights and responsibilities and the issue of federal blackmail, parenting<br/>\nsites focus on prevention and communication, law enforcement sites focus on<br/>\ndriving, a few educational radicals have other ideas, and then there are<br/>\nsites about addiction/alcoholism in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the internet!<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly in terms of parents allowing minors to use alcohol in the<br/>\nhome, so far I have only found (buried in a pdf) the law in California<br/>\n(parental supervision in the home when only family is present, or as part of<br/>\nreligious ceremonies and administered by a parent/guardian), and a general<br/>\nstatement that &quot;the penalties, if any, vary between States&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, a big point is an increasing focus on laws entitled Social Host<br/>\nLaws, attempting to stop adults allowing minors other than their own<br/>\nchildren to consume alcohol or drugs in their homes, either in the adults&#39;<br/>\npresence or in absentia. No more wild teen parties y&#39;all - hey I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nthat movie lots of times - the nadir of school culture? Another pop culture<br/>\nphenomenon that probably doesn&#39;t apply to Unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo again back to my original badly stated point. It is useful to have a<br/>\nreasonable idea of the law to help you make decisions about your lifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
