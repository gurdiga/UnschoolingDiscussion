I&#39;m Linda, and I have a terrific <br/>\nthree-and-a-half-year-old daughter (Kalie). We decided to homeschool, and <br/>\nsince doing some research, feel unschooling is definitely the way to go - we <br/>\nconsider that we&#39;re already on our way! (A VERY unpopular, misunderstood <br/>\ndecision with friends and relatives, but it seems you all know all about <br/>\nthat!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I noticed that you mentioned, Ren, that you are working on your <br/>\nchildren&#39;s urge to hit when they&#39;re frustrated. I&#39;d love to know what you&#39;re <br/>\ndoing and how you&#39;re handling this, and also how old Trevor and Sierra are. <br/>\nKalie has taken to doing this sometimes, especially when she&#39;s overtired (and <br/>\nsince she has never been a very relaxed sleeper, this is pretty often). She <br/>\nhit another child on the head (several times, before they were separated) <br/>\nwith a toy at a playgroup recently(although she patted and hugged the other <br/>\ngirl immediately afterward), and will also try to kick sometimes. It was a <br/>\nbig incident at playgroup, and let&#39;s just say we don&#39;t feel very welcome <br/>\nthere anymore. Anyway, I want to help her through this the best way possible, <br/>\nand could use some advice. Reading and talking to parents whose kids have <br/>\nbeen through the &quot;threes&quot; leads me to believe this is not unusual, since this <br/>\nage group can be easily overwhelmed and frustrated, but obviously we can&#39;t <br/>\nlet her go around bopping people. <br/>\n<br/>\nHelp?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 10/23/02 5:45:37 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\nSubject: progress<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sierra just came to me crying, because Trevor had taken his skateboard back <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and she was having a ball with it.<br/>\n&gt; He was irritated because he had asked her to leave it alone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;But I was having fun with it&quot; she wailed.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;you really were, weren&#39;t you?&quot; <br/>\n&gt; She nods in agreement.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I think you really need your own skateboard, don&#39;t you Sierra&quot;<br/>\n&gt; She nods again then shouts &quot;yeah, my very own&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Then wipes her eyes and says &quot;I KNOW, A Barbie one, then the boys won&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; touch <br/>\n&gt; it!!<br/>\n&gt; Then we both laughed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She walked off a happy child, feeling heard, feeling understood.
