(Just as you can pull a kid from public school and<br/>\nthen R-4) My point is that perceived legalities are not a reason to stay<br/>\nwith a Charter School until the school year is done. The number one regret<br/>\nexpressed by people who take up unschooling after a certain time, is that<br/>\nthey didn&#39;t do it sooner. Remember there is no testing, and no requirement<br/>\nfor portfolios or assessments in California. If the Charter is grading,<br/>\ntesting and assessing it is because they are accountable to the paying<br/>\ncustomers, not the education laws for non-government schools.

He has always been ready to fly on his own if he<br/>\nis not being weighed down by those expectations. How much better to have a<br/>\nwriting mentor who is interested in his stories out of personal liking and<br/>\nfriendship, than because it is part of the curriculum and must be covered<br/>\nweekly, as part of being paid.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I am very interested in the UNschooling<br/>\nconferences and would love to attend one.  I live about 35 miles from Sac.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been homeschooling my grandson for 5 years  and want to shift to<br/>\nUNschooling with him.  I have been trying to gradually change the way we<br/>\ndo things, sort of &quot;feeling my way&quot; towards an &quot;unidentified goal&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess this post looks like it will serve as my introduction!!  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my hubby and I took on the Guardianship of Kristopher (at age 14 mo.),<br/>\nI knew I would want to homeschool him and began researching right away.<br/>\nWe struggled through 1st grade.  I joined a charter school for 2nd grade, but<br/>\ndid not really know how to use it to my advantage.  Third and 4th grades we have<br/>\nbeen with a wonderful Charter School and have an advisor who has been a<br/>\nreal blessing to me.  She is an experienced PS teacher who is now homeschooling<br/>\nher own children, and her assistance has been invaluable to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristopher, now 10, is repeating 4th grade - but with different curriculum (I don&#39;t<br/>\nsee<br/>\nthat word on this list very much!!  LOL). Through the Charter School, he took the<br/>\nsame tests given in the Calif. PS.....he finished 4th grade last year at a<br/>\nbeginning-4th-grade<br/>\nlevel...He is very bright in math, so we are working with 5th grade level math.<br/>\n Kristopher has had some some difficulties, and after having<br/>\nhim tested, it was decided he just needed a little boost in reading comprehension and<br/>\nself expression.  Don&#39;t get me wrong....he can self express loud and long!!!.....he<br/>\njust has a real struggle when it comes to getting his thoughts on paper.  As this year<br/>\nhas<br/>\nprogressed, I have come more and more to realize he needs to be in a more relaxed<br/>\nsituation, which I think I can provide for him through UNschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Charter school is providing some tutoring......I was able to pick the teacher for<br/>\nthis!<br/>\nHe has made wonderful progress and loves going once a week to her home.  His reading<br/>\ncomprehension has improved 100%.  He is beginning to use his imagination to create<br/>\nstories, including descriptive words, etc.  Rather than &quot;writing&quot; them, he tells them<br/>\nto<br/>\nhis tutor and she writes them down.  Then....at home he types the story into his<br/>\ncomputer,<br/>\nediting it where necessary.  I think by this spring, he will be ready to &quot;fly on his<br/>\nown&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am ready to have him &quot;fly on his own&quot;!!  I have been reading this list for a couple<br/>\nweeks....<br/>\nand am overwhelmed with the volume of posts.  However, for the most part, they have<br/>\nbeen very beneficial for me and helping me to begin thinking UNschooling!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shift is not as easy as I had thought it might be......the &quot;old school&quot; ideas are<br/>\npretty<br/>\nwell implanted in my mind!  We are visiting the library and allowing him to check out<br/>\nvideos, books, etc.   Interestingly enough, he is checking out educational videos!!<br/>\nI have been asking him what he would like to learn about, hoping to spark some<br/>\ninterest<br/>\nin research, etc.  Self-teaching.....hmmmmmm, how do I explain that to him?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess you can see that I am struggling with this.  Since we are still part of the<br/>\nCharter<br/>\nSchool, we do have to submit a sample of each of the four core subjects once a<br/>\nmonth, along with attendance records, and twice a year, report cards and ILPs.<br/>\nI will finish out the year with this, and probably not re-up with them in the fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we are headed in the right direction!!!
