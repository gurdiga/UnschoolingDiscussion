The oldest is in college, the other two at home with me!  Doing that schooling thing.  :)  I&#39;ve been lurking awhile, but was moved to write when I saw the post about the 9-year-old.  I&#39;d say definitely relax and don&#39;t worry!  My example actually comes from my own younger sister - she&#39;s in her 2nd year of college now.  She slept with mom until about age 12 or so.  And never wanted to really go anywhere without her.  Even during her teens she didn&#39;t want to be left alone at home!   I&#39;d say that made her feel pretty secure in the long run, because now she is the most independent and capable young person I know at age 19.  She really hit the ground running!  There&#39;s nothing she&#39;s afraid to tackle, she&#39;s set her goals and is quite successfully following through.  She&#39;s living an hour away from home on campus, and doing very well for herself - socially and educationally.  And that&#39;s my 2 cents.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Alyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFaith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos, & more<br/>\nfaith.yahoo.com<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45433,"nextTopicId":45447}}
