I can home school freely there because we will be <br/>\nliving on American Federal Land. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, there is a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between the US <br/>\nand each country that hosts US military forces.  The SOFA agreements <br/>\ncan vary by country and are used to determine what happens when a <br/>\nmilitary member or their dependents break local law. If the crime is <br/>\nserious like drugs or rape sometimes the military turns the perp over <br/>\nto the local authorities or they might just be shipped back to the <br/>\nstates. I think there is alot of leeway for the military authorities <br/>\nto determine what happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have one friend who was on liberty off a Navy ship in Greece and <br/>\nstole a Greek flag. He had to spend 3 months in a Greek prison. <br/>\nNormally that crime would only involve a return to the ship, a really <br/>\nmad skipper, and perhaps a slap on the wrist or a fine. At the time, <br/>\nthough, there were negotiations going on between Greece and the US <br/>\nabout trade issues (or something like that).  Our friend feels that <br/>\nhad alot to do with why his crime resulted in a prison sentence <br/>\ninstead of just a fine. So there are often politics involved. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad was in the Air Force and when we were stationed at Kadena AFB <br/>\non Okinawa in 72-75, 16yo could drive cars on but only on base.

I spent my last 2 years of high school in Morocco and although I <br/>\nHATED it at the time....what a learning experience it was!!!!   Germany would <br/>\nbe wonderful for your family.  I really feel for you but it will be ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband just called home and asked if I would go back to work because he <br/>\nwants to quit his job!  Well, I&#39;m not interested in the least bit in going back <br/>\nto teaching with a 1yr and 3 1/2 yr old at home.  Not to mention, now that <br/>\nI&#39;ve decided to unschool them, I don&#39;t really want to ever have to go back to <br/>\nteaching in ps!  Hopefully by the time he gets home tonight he will have calmed <br/>\ndown a little and not quit on his way out the door!   So it looks like we&#39;ll <br/>\nbe going through some life changes as well.  Some career changes can change <br/>\nyour life so much!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and try to be open minded about how wonderful the experience of <br/>\nliving in Europe will be.  It&#39;s so easy to travel all around Europe on the train, <br/>\ncheaply!   Since you unschool, you can do so much!  I attended an American <br/>\nschool and still had the chance to travel a lot (spent thanksgiving vacation one <br/>\nyear on a camel in the Sahara)!  Have fun....I love Europe & am kind of <br/>\njealous now!<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89146,"nextTopicId":89026}}
