You are still thinking in school mode.  In<br/>\nschool, in a classroom of 20 students, each step - of Math for example - has<br/>\nto be learned in a specific order and everyone is expected to be on the same<br/>\nstep.  That&#39;s where trouble starts - you miss a step and it&#39;s bad news!<br/>\n<br/>\nArgh - A school memory just popped into my head - I was sitting in Algebra 2<br/>\nNow, mind you,  I had spent Algebra 1 with my book propped up with a<br/>\nHistorical Romance inside it because it was so boring, and then had a year<br/>\nof Geometry - so here I am in Algeba 2 and this teacher starts to &quot;teach&quot;<br/>\nand<br/>\nI&#39;m TOTALLY lost.  I don&#39;t remember how I got through the year - maybe I<br/>\ndropped the class :o) - I just remember that moment of terror!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, back to the point I wanted to make.  Kids out of a classroom can<br/>\ndiscover bits and pieces on their own and then put it together in their own<br/>\nway. My 7yo has figured out things that in school would be called<br/>\nmultiplication or division, but to him it&#39;s just things you can do with 4 or<br/>\n6 or 10. And he seems to understand it in the abstract as well as with<br/>\nobjects.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your 10yo has &quot;Math Attitude&quot; she may need time to stand back and see why<br/>\nmath is important in her life - Real Math, I guess.  Or maybe if you have to<br/>\nhave math books try some of the fun ones like Math for Smarty Pants by<br/>\nMarilyn Burns or try playing card games, etc and reminding yourself &quot;This is<br/>\nmath and EVERYTHING counts!&quot;  Or maybe a homebased business and savings<br/>\naccount - am I on a roll here or what!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remember, schools spend so much time on review and keeping the whole<br/>\nclass together that the material they cover in a year can be handled in much<br/>\nless time one-on-one at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read &quot;Deschooling Our Lives&quot; edited by Matt Hern?  It&#39;s been<br/>\nawhile, but I remember I enjoyed the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are hard core unschoolers here - we don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; anything!<br/>\n<br/>\nBecky in Ohio</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2614,"nextTopicId":2620}}
