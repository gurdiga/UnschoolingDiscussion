That makes no sense whatsoever! If you are full, you keep putting the fork <br/>\nin your mouth? Take it home!

No waste. If <br/>\nI buy a book for my kids and they don&#39;t use it and it sits on a shelf, did I <br/>\nwaste my money or a tree or my time? NO. Maybe someday, they will look at the <br/>\nbook, maybe someday I will have another kid who will, or a grandchild, or my <br/>\nhusband, or a niece, or maybe one of you will post one day that one of your kids <br/>\nis looking for this certain book and just can&#39;t find it... Just because <br/>\nsomething isn&#39;t what you thought it should be initially, does not mean it is <br/>\nvalueless, or wasted. I bought a different brand of that boxed mac-n-cheese stuff, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t like any of it, but my kids do and it is easy for them to fix. Turns <br/>\nout that *on sale* doesn&#39;t translate into *my kids love it* good thing though. I <br/>\nforgot to buy dog food and wasn&#39;t getting back out until later that evening. <br/>\nThe dog was hungry, the kids said YUCK and the dog got mac-n-cheese at a cost <br/>\nto me of thirty-three cents. Well, worth it if you ask me. Other wise I would <br/>\nhave had to call Darin, ask him to come home to give me the car so I could go <br/>\nback out, buy the dog food, then go back out again to get Darin when he was <br/>\ndone with work. Cost? More than thirty-three cents I assure you. <br/>\n<br/>\nGranted your cost was way more than thirty-three cents, BUT can&#39;t you turn <br/>\nthis around somehow? Others have suggested just quitting, someone else suggested <br/>\nkeeping the things, maybe he will use them later, nothing wrong with that. <br/>\nYou have to set this right in your mind by yourself. It isn&#39;t your kids fault <br/>\nthat he doesn&#39;t like the class. He thought he might like it, he didn&#39;t, end of <br/>\nstory. I thought my kids would like the mac-n-cheese, what do I know?

He very likely did not start this course thinking, &quot;I&#39;ll trick<br/>\nmy Mom into paying a huge amount of money and then I&#39;ll just QUIT!<br/>\nHahahahaha.&quot; He probably thought he&#39;d enjoy it and found that he didn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sitting here thinking, how could I ever have known that this<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t the right choice for him, when he told me it&#39;s what he wanted?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t. Everyone makes mistakes. Continuing to do something we don&#39;t want<br/>\nfor the sake of money is putting money ahead of humans. Bad idea. Your son<br/>\nwill make mistakes, being human and all. If you can look at him and his<br/>\nneeds first and &quot;money and contracts&quot; second, you can heal what was done to<br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So I guess the &quot;right thing&quot; is for me to just suck it up and pay the<br/>\n&gt; money, but for my son to not have to do anything.  Wish I could get<br/>\n&gt; the people in MY life to let me get away with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They might, if you give them the opportunity and example.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you try something new in a restaurant and don&#39;t like it, do you finish<br/>\nthe plate anyway because you paid for it?
