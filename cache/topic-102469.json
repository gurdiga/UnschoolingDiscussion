Usually <br/>\nbecause we like the other parts of the job...maybe the pay, the <br/>\nhours, the benefits etc.  If you really think about it we ARE <br/>\nchoosing to do the things our bosses ask us to do, we may SAY <br/>\nwe &quot;have&quot; to do it but in reality we dont.  We all have the option <br/>\nof telling our bosses &#39;no&#39; at any time. <br/>\nIn my opinion there is a huge difference between situation A: a work <br/>\nsituation with a boss telling us what to do, and situation B: mom <br/>\nand dad telling us what to do.   Mom and Dad telling us what to do <br/>\nisnt always like real life where we DO have options and can weigh <br/>\nout the consequences for ourselves and make a decision.   <br/>\nWe can choose to break or follow laws, listen or not listen to <br/>\nbosses etc and each choice has a result but in the end we&#39;re free to <br/>\nmake the choice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Elisa Tauraso&quot; <br/>\n&lt;elisatauraso@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am still exploring unschooling and am in the midst of reading <br/>\n </span></blockquote>all the wonderful books that you all have suggested however I have a <br/>\nconcern not yet answered....<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; For example, today I asked my daughter to skip count with me in an <br/>\n </span></blockquote>effort to lean her towards learning her times tables.
