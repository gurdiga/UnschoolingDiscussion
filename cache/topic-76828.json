My aunt and uncle have been told that she will end up in jail if they do <br/>\nnot commit her to some hospital for behavior dysfunction. But what answer is <br/>\nthat? Basically the &quot;experts&quot; on nearly every level have given them no hope. So <br/>\neither way, she should be locked up, according to their prophesies. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not just a daily struggle, but literally a minute by minute struggle. <br/>\nShe can be seemingly fine and quiet one moment and a wild banshee the next. <br/>\nThen of course come the self preservation/society preservation questions....do <br/>\nyou actually go ahead and commit such a child because there are valid fears of <br/>\nwhat she has the ability to do? Or do you utilize every ounce of energy and <br/>\nhumanity to save her? And can she be saved from herself? And what about the rest <br/>\nof the world? <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is spending the summer with us, everyother week, Monday to Friday, 13 <br/>\nhours a day. On the opposing weeks she is with my aunt or uncle as they are <br/>\nalternating taking vacation weeks to be with her. At 14, there are no resources for <br/>\nkids like this. Nor would any facility providing summer camps be willing to <br/>\ntake on such a responsibility. My struggle now is why am I? Is it ego driven <br/>\nbecause she does well with us? Is it because I can&#39;t take seeing my mom, my <br/>\naunt&#39;s or my uncle&#39;s (we are the Irish equivelent to My Big Fat Greek Wedding) <br/>\nshed another tear? In the four full weeks I have had her, we had one meltdown for <br/>\nthe last hour before she went home one day and the amount of eneregy it took <br/>\nwas utterly incredible. I can&#39;t fathom living it everyday with no light at the <br/>\nend of the tunnel. The theory that she would outgrow certain behaviors was <br/>\nWRONG. She is seeming to get worse. So I won&#39;t stop having her, over that one <br/>\nbreakdown, but it was enough for me to question my own intentions and enough to <br/>\nput me on gaurd. And it was enough for me to see that her parents diminished <br/>\nmarriage (which devestated this large extended family), even in the strongest <br/>\nrelationships, would have a very hard time surviving. <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if I have rambled and turned this thread around to be about my family <br/>\nand it&#39;s struggles, but if there are any people in the world who wouldn&#39;t give <br/>\nup on their own children, it is definately the people here. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace to all of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76820,"nextTopicId":76842}}
