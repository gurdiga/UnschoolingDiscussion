Plus I don&#39;t like to drive and get sleepy headed<br/>\nafter 3-4 hours.  I get too many what-if&#39;s going on in my head and talk<br/>\nmyself out of it, but I haven&#39;t wanted to travel to a conference this much<br/>\nbefore either..lol.  So we will see.  Hopefully hubby can come with me and I<br/>\nwon&#39;t have to worry about driving, but, the more I read here, the more I<br/>\nwant to go, and I know the kids would love it.  We got a tv last big trip<br/>\n(hubby with us) and they watched videos too, they loved it...smoothest trip<br/>\nwe ever had.  When&#39;s the deadline for the family rate?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-------------------------\r<br/>\nTammy,     I&#39;ve done a lot of travel with just me and my boys. Book on tape,\r<br/>\nsing-a-longs, snacks, and a few small new Dollar Store toys can make a trip\r<br/>\na lot easier on my guys when they were little. We&#39;ve seen and done a lot.\r<br/>\nNeed ideas just ask. :-) \r<br/>\nBarb E<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73623,"nextTopicId":17145}}
