I &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n     Hi, I am unschooling kids ages 4, 9, almost 13 (2, twins), and almost <br/>\n17.  I have found that it gets easier as they get older because they develop <br/>\ntheir own interests more and more and lead themselves into things they want <br/>\nto learn more about.  My oldest is very serious about music and spends 2 to 3 <br/>\nhours playing guitar  plus more time studying his Music Theory books.  We are <br/>\nin California so he is taking the high school proficieny exam this month and <br/>\nif he passes, he&#39;ll have the legal equivalent of a diploma.  From there, he&#39;s <br/>\nplanning to take community college classes in things that interest him, <br/>\nprimarily music, but some other things as well.  He spends about 2 hrs a day <br/>\non the internet usually and has developed strong opinions about many issues <br/>\nfrom reading others&#39; and posting his own on the bulletin boards that interest <br/>\nhim.  He also reads a lot.  I do recommend books sometimes and he has read <br/>\nbooks he probably wouldn&#39;t have read on his own but ended up loving.  He said <br/>\nhis favorite is a book called Disobedience by Jane Hamilton (one of my <br/>\nsuggestions).<br/>\n     One of our almost 13 yr olds loves writing and gardening.  Yesterday he <br/>\ngot to spend part of the day with a family in our h/s group that does organic <br/>\ngardening and got to help harvest and learn a lot.  He will go back again <br/>\nwhen they&#39;re ready for him.  He also spends many hours writing long science <br/>\nfiction novels on the computer.<br/>\n     My other almost 13 yr old loves history, reading fantasy, and activism.  <br/>\nHe knows the Civil War really well and has many books on it (including the <br/>\nhuge volumes by Shelby Foote, his favorite).  He loves the Harry Potter books <br/>\nand King Arthur and other fantasy series.  He is planning to join me and his <br/>\ndad in volunteering for Habitat for Humanity (his will have to be fund <br/>\nraising and other off building site activities until he&#39;s 14 according to the <br/>\nrules).  He recently read The Jungle about the meat packing plants at the <br/>\nturn of the previous century and has strong views about that and other <br/>\ninjustices.<br/>\n     All of this sounds good (even to me) in print and in fact, I am excited <br/>\nabout many recent developments in all of our lives.  But there are many days <br/>\nthat wouldn&#39;t look very impressive to an observer.  And when I read one of <br/>\nthe John Holt books a few years ago about some of the accomplishments of <br/>\nunschoolers, they sounded incredible to me, not something I could picture our <br/>\nfamily doing.<br/>\n     I believe if you just trust your child and yourself enough, all of you <br/>\nwill find your own best paths.  I do think it is good to expose kids to <br/>\nenough for them to find the things that catch their interests but these can <br/>\nbe the normal things in your own life and the lives of people you know.  <br/>\nSorry this was so long!<br/>\n<br/>\n       Lucy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"dWQpU7eS2UlO1iy5AMzl8Qkwi4_67dfVqrQepWe8zuXwxkBOGU8AdpzYXAAjRS8nk8110BMAw9UbcCO3FZ75q_w_4B1ffuwH9hlO-llhmQ6T4rb7qw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: cesarean birth","postDate":"986897198","msgId":18447,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBRDJFOTNFLjI2NDkuMjNBRTAxQGxvY2FsaG9zdD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwYjEwMWMwYzEyZiQwOTMwZjE0MCRhMDVkZDFkMUBsZGlvbm5vPg=="},"prevInTopic":18432,"nextInTopic":18518,"prevInTime":18446,"nextInTime":18448,"topicId":18389,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sounds like they put in a pic line which is a little more invasive than a\u000f hep lock.\u000e Also, hep locks can be put in most any good sized vein and the\u000f pic is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-698332899\">Sounds like they put in a pic line which is a little <br/>\nmore invasive than a\u000f<br/>\nhep lock.\u000e Also, hep locks can be put in most any good <br/>\nsized vein and the\u000f<br/>\npic is usually put in that vein on the inside edge of <br/>\nyour elbow.\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\nLynda\u000f<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I saw someone else (might have been on telly) <br/>\nwith the same thing in the back of their hand, much <br/>\nmore sensible place for it!  <br/>\n<br/>\nLoooong time ago, that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"B P","from":"B P &lt;emailbeep@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"xuTVNevPfKF8wS5Hc3glmmFr7TsJ_6CzN5-q0_e1YC9yKJH5fHkRl0_23VSdeCJ0Yeqrd1R-zVkbt3Yd7GRb4A","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[Unschooling-dotcom] Unlurking Intro/Re: cesarean birth/HSing teens","postDate":"986862875","msgId":18432,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwNDEwMDAzNDM1Ljk5OTY0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzMTA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDlhc3A0YitiZmhyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18418,"nextInTopic":18447,"prevInTime":18431,"nextInTime":18433,"topicId":18389,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Wups, sent that one by accident before I was done...

This was 5 1/2 years ago.  They (the medical establishment)<br/>\n&gt; said I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; should have the hep lock in place in case my uterus ruptured<br/>\n&gt; during<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; labor, that I was more at risk for that because of the previous<br/>\n&gt; cesarean.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Well, I did some research.  Uterine rupture is incredibly rare<br/>\n&gt; and is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not more likely in women who have had a cesarean, especially with<br/>\n&gt; low<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; horizontal cuts.  The hep lock is supposed to provide instant<br/>\n&gt; access to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an IV.  But, you can have a hep lock and the vein behind it can<br/>\n&gt; collapse,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so that wouldn&#39;t guarantee IV access after all.  In emergencies,<br/>\n&gt; an IV<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can be placed in the scalp or somewhere in the neck (can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; remember -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; clavicle vein or something?)  I figured that in the event I became<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unconscious because of a hemmoraghe (sp) from uterine rupture, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certainly would not care where they stuck the IV!  And I knew it<br/>\n&gt; was very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; highly UNlikely for that to happen anyway.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mary Ellen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The other day, she caught herself about to tell someone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her hair looked nice on the phone.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; List settings page:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
