They DID do some things  with <br/>\ntheir dad but clearly choose to spend their time with me.  We parent  VERY <br/>\ndifferently.  He never really was fully &quot;on board&quot; with the children  having a choice <br/>\non going to school or not.  He just accepted that they were  engaged in <br/>\nsomething fun or exciting and he didn&#39;t say much about it for the  most part.<br/>\n <br/>\nI tried to include him as much a possible but sometimes it was better and  <br/>\neasier and more fun if we just let him be at whatever he was doing at the  time.<br/>\n <br/>\nFast forward, my children are now 16, almost 20, 21 and 24, they still  <br/>\nprefer my company and will choose to be with me.  I think because I am WITH  them <br/>\nwhen they are here.  DH is HERE but might be clicking away on his  laptop or <br/>\nsort of watching a movie and tends to really know little about what is  going on <br/>\nif it doesn&#39;t directly include him.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe gets VERY jealous of the relationship I have with the children.   I&#39;ve <br/>\ntried over the years to include him in everything we do but the truth is  that I <br/>\noften felt like a single parent in a two adult household.  The  &quot;because I <br/>\nsaid so&quot; routine was not acceptable to me, but was to him.<br/>\n <br/>\nI feel badly for him, I would be hurt beyond words if I were in his shoes  <br/>\nand had the relationship with the children that he does.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe GIVES them THINGS not time.  Which is good and his non stop working  has <br/>\nprovided us with the means to do just about everything we&#39;ve wanted to  <br/>\nexplore.  I much would have rather he been more &quot;plugged in&quot; to us as a  family but <br/>\nit just didn&#39;t happen.<br/>\n <br/>\nOn a recent family trip with all of us, four hotel rooms, same floor, made  <br/>\nan &quot;executive decision&quot; that I was no longer available after 10:00 PM as a  <br/>\nmother, unless their hair was on fire they were not to call me or come to my  <br/>\nroom.  The girls and I were laying across the bed in my room and the boys  would <br/>\ncome up the hall every now and again to relate some information or talk  about <br/>\nsomething we might do the next day.<br/>\n <br/>\nNothing that was of great importance to him but to them it was.  They  could <br/>\nhave all been out having fun doing something together or apart but were  happy <br/>\nto just hang out at the hotel and be in and out of my room.<br/>\n <br/>\nI felt sad for him that he felt so left out or less loved or less a part of  <br/>\nour family.  But at that moment I also knew that HE created this atmosphere  <br/>\nfor himself.  Years of his own detaching from them and &quot;allowing&quot; me to do  <br/>\n&quot;whatever I think is best&quot; got him to this point.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have been extra careful to pay more attention to him as my husband after  <br/>\nthis, but the children feel no such inclination to try to be more attentive or  <br/>\ninclusive of him, probably from years of experience of him nodding and not  <br/>\nhearing or simply &quot;not having the time&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t know how you could &quot;force&quot; a husband to be more fully a  father.

I find myself going through the stages of <br/>\nteaching myself to &quot;let go&quot; with my children.  And, of course, I do not mean this <br/>\nliterally.... but figuratively.  Letting go of all my &quot;rules&quot;.  As a new parent <br/>\nyears ago, I told myself I would never be over controlling with ridiculous <br/>\nrules set, simply for the sake of setting a rule.  But as years went on, I had <br/>\nquite a few.  Perhaps not to the extent many other parents had them, but enough <br/>\nto be overbearing.  But over the past 6 months that I&#39;ve been homeschooling, I <br/>\nhave made concious efforts to lay off, and I&#39;ve seen wonderful changes in <br/>\nboth my children.  Recently (this past week) my son (8) has again been asking me <br/>\nto get his ear pierced.  This is something I&#39;ve adamently said no too for <br/>\nyears now.  He&#39;s been asking since he was 4.  But, after talking with him I&#39;ve <br/>\nrealized it&#39;s just something he really wants, so why the heck not?  Having been <br/>\nasking for 4 years, clearly it&#39;s something he feels he needs for his own <br/>\nself-expression.  So, this coming week, I&#39;m going to take him and have it done.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve only ever said no, because I didn&#39;t (don&#39;t) think a young boy looks <br/>\nappropriate with one.  But  who am I to judge??  I have find my ways of thinking <br/>\nchanging over these months, and I truly think it&#39;s for the better.<br/>\nAs for 2-3 year olds having freedom of choice... well, ya&#39;ll should meet my 3 <br/>\nyear old daughter!!! hahaha  She demands freedom of choice and always has.  <br/>\nMy son is very much &quot;mommy&#39;s boy&quot; and is much more needy.  But my daughter is a <br/>\ntrue free spirit and has ALWAYS been very independant and self-reliant.  When <br/>\nshe asks for something you learn very quickly to ask her for DETAILS in how <br/>\nshe wants it, otherwise you have a full fledged temper tantrum on hand.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t find this catering or spoiling either.  (as many others try to tell me it <br/>\nis)  I view it as allowing her to be herself.  And being Stephanie means, <br/>\nknowing what, when, where, why, and how she wants things.  Example:  she asks for a <br/>\ndrink.  You can&#39;t just get up and assume what she wants.  I ask her &quot;what <br/>\nwould you like to drink?  Ok, which cup do you want that in today? How much do you <br/>\nwant?  Alot or a little?&quot;  Simple enough, I think.  She gets just what she&#39;s <br/>\nwanting, and I don&#39;t get to hear her screaming because I &quot;DID IT WRONG!&quot;<br/>\nI&#39;ve become very aware of the changes in my parenting.  And have become <br/>\nreminded of how much I despised my own parents during my teen years when they were <br/>\nso overbearing (they called it being &quot;protective&quot;) that I was not allowed out <br/>\nof the house after dark, even if it was winter and dark at 3:30pm.  All my <br/>\ncalls were monitored (meaning listened in on by a 2nd phone line), and never <br/>\nallowed sleep overs and etc etc.  I can&#39;t bear to be that way with my own kids.  <br/>\nWell thanks for listening all.... I&#39;m SO thrilled I found this group!<br/>\nEmily<br/>\nWife to Chris, mom to Joshua and Stephanie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"kids making decisions for themselves","postDate":"1088876827","msgId":96024,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExMy4zNGMyNzYxMy4yZTE4NGIxYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":96029,"prevInTime":96023,"nextInTime":96025,"topicId":96024,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"COOL!

While I was working on another post, this one came, and is about the <br/>\nsame topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;There is no single statement that would cause all parents to realize the <br/>\nbenefits of removing limits.  It takes many conversations and hearing or reading <br/>\nstories of families where it is working.  Maybe some people read one thing, <br/>\none time and totally change, but I needed to hear or read it over and over <br/>\nbefore it made sense.  It also took self examination for me to realize areas I was <br/>\nsetting limits without realizing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Mary Ellen&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Life Learning post before this, I had quoted the end of a letter to <br/>\nthe editor who was thanking them for the anti-&quot;machine&quot; article.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the second of two pararaphs there:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-&quot;I say, everything in balance, in its own developmentally appropriate <br/>\ntime.  However, I am not about to let my two-year-old child play in traffic in the <br/>\nname of freedom; nor will she have unfettered use of electronic media until <br/>\nshe can make that decision for herself.&quot;<br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHad that been posted here by its author, it might have been taken apart and <br/>\nput back together in more logical fashion, and not published in an <br/>\ninternational magazine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen WOULD a child make a decision for herself to play in traffic or to &quot;have <br/>\nunfettered use of electronic media&quot; ?  (I&#39;m guessing that the unfettered use <br/>\ncarried a motherly assumption of all kinds of porn and bomb-building and <br/>\nviolence, not the more-likely kid-sites like uptoten or neopets or a zoo webcam of <br/>\na baby giraffe, or whatever all&#39;s currently &quot;zoocammed&quot; this week.  But even <br/>\nif it&#39;s unfettered two-year-old use of a patterns game or coloring program, <br/>\nwhere&#39;s the evil in &quot;unfettered&quot;?  Fetters are not gotreme and not thought <br/>\nthrough.<br/>\nA two year old who is unlikely to be able to use the mouse well enough to <br/>\nclick on PuttPutt won&#39;t play long, and she certainly won&#39;t find objectional <br/>\nwebsites.  And if she does, she won&#39;t read them. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyway, until children are given choices, they can&#39;t make decisions.  And <br/>\neven two year olds can be given choices.  I&#39;ve known a lot of two year olds, <br/>\nand if I had one who would rather play in traffic than sit in my lap or hold <br/>\nmy hand, I would think there was something wrong with the life I was offering <br/>\nher.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI read Holly a parental statement which had been posted in public, and her <br/>\nresponse as an always-unschooled twelve-year-old was interesting.  Here&#39;s that, <br/>\nbut they&#39;re also at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strew/ifilet\">http://sandradodd.com/strew/ifilet</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-=-This one is just almost too big for this page, so brace yourself:<br/>\nIf my kids had their way, they&#39;d go barefoot outside of their own yard, run <br/>\nin the street between cars, never take baths, never eat their veggies and <br/>\ninstead opt for chocolate cake every meal, mistreat animals, burn down the house <br/>\nplaying with matches, never go to bed, never brush their teeth, etc. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Holly&#39;s response:<br/>\n<br/>\nI read that to Holly and she was speechless. Seriously mouth-open disbelief. <br/>\nThen she asked &quot;WHY would they burn the house down with matches?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;The only reason her house is not burned down is because she has a rule <br/>\nagainst playing with matches.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;So she can&#39;t even say &#39;You can play with matches but only in the front <br/>\ndriveway&#39;?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Nope.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;So they&#39;ll never go to bed because they&#39;ll never get tired unless she tells <br/>\nthem they&#39;re tired?&quot;<br/>\nShe asked me to read it to her again. I did. She looked at it and looked at <br/>\nme and said with more feeling, &quot;Why the hell would they run between cars in the <br/>\nstreet!?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so...<br/>\nA child knows these things are nonsense, but adults who have reproduced can <br/>\ngo so far as to publish them for the &quot;benefit&quot; of other parents??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe some people just don&#39;t really think.<br/>\nThey justify. <br/>\nThey pull phrases from the other justifying parents around them to defend <br/>\ntheir controlling behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s for your own good.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;You&#39;ll thank me later.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it&#39;s not good, they won&#39;t thank them, and the parents would have <br/>\ndone better to do more thinking and less talking.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96116,"nextTopicId":96134}}
