Most of the time, the feeling of being<br/>\nundervalued or unappreciated is MY issue.  After the initial angst<br/>\nsubsides, I evaluate.<br/>\n Are people truly treating me poorly?  Did my child or spouse act<br/>\ntruly disrespectfully to me (because that IS worth addressing at some<br/>\npoint, when you aren&#39;t angry).  Is something from my past surfacing?<br/>\nOr maybe, it was all completely innocent and I&#39;m letting a LOT of<br/>\nfiltering happen to reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the reality about most of this stuff (for me)...<br/>\nmy children are happily pursuing what matters most to them at the<br/>\nmoment, not concerned with anything beyond the activity they are<br/>\ninvolved in. What a lovely way to live!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when I start to react internally (let&#39;s use mess as an example,<br/>\nsince it&#39;s MY issue:) I begin to look around, see all that mess as a<br/>\nbunch of healthy, happy people pursuing LIFE and realize that it has<br/>\nNOTHING to do with me. <br/>\nThey aren&#39;t making mess to bother anyone, they aren&#39;t leaving stuff<br/>\nabout to try and cause angst or because they don&#39;t care....it&#39;s<br/>\nbecause they live in the moment.<br/>\nMy dh doesn&#39;t put something in the wrong place, or treat it<br/>\ndifferently than I would because he wants to aggravate me...people<br/>\ndon&#39;t do that in healthy relationships!  People inadvertently do<br/>\nthings that might annoy someone else, seeing it as innocent and<br/>\nunintended helps me own the experience and not blame.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf something is painfully obvious, I will point it out..&quot;HEY, those<br/>\nwrappers belong in the garbage, not on my floor&quot; but as I&#39;m saying it,<br/>\nI&#39;m also picking them up. They get it over time, and as they get older.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMarkus noticed dishes that were sitting on the table today, after kids<br/>\nwere off doing other things.  I started cleaning up and he says &quot;are<br/>\nthey helping?&quot;<br/>\nI said &quot;often and happily, but not this mess right now&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Well, I know, I just want to make sure they aren&#39;t leaving it all to you&quot;<br/>\nMy honest answer was: &quot;you know what? I would much rather clean up the<br/>\nparts they don&#39;t care for and have the cheerful, sweet help coming<br/>\nfrom true desire that I&#39;m getting all the time&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe got it. He&#39;s really getting so much better about the clean up<br/>\nissues...something that has taken a lot longer than all his other shifts. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah, sometimes I ask for help, sometimes I get annoyed, but I&#39;m<br/>\nowning those feelings more and more and blaming others for them less<br/>\nand less.

I almost decided not to do another semeseter, but at the last minute thought I&#39;d try one more.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, this semester is going so much better.  The paperwork is a lot lighter than last semester so I&#39;m going to ask to do this course from now on (Nsg 206).  Im feeling much more relaxed about work, enough so that I can actually sign up for a few extra hours/week as a bedside nurse which means we will have extra money to do some fun things.  Next Friday I&#39;m taking the kids to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia  (thanks to whoever it was who posted the Happy Hollow membership information!!!).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our family was in counseling (long story) and I must say, things got so much worse during counseling.  The counselor really did not understand the unschooling mindset, often telling me my daughter needed more &quot;structure&quot; and that when she said she wanted a counselor who was more strict, he interpreted that to mean she wanted stricter parents. He also habitually would explain her behavior in terms of &quot;thats how it is with teen girls&quot; (which I dont&#39; buy). In addition he would often make comments about the fact that she was not in school and how that was going to make his job harder because they usually have team meetings with school officials (I wouldn&#39;t want that going on even if she *were* in school!).<br/>\n<br/>\n  When he wanted more information about my kind of parenting I printed the article on unschooling.info about &quot;principles vs rules&quot; and I recommended he read &quot;Parent Teen Breakthrough....&quot;.  hen he told me he had never heard of the book, I knew we were in trouble because that book comes highly recommended by many family psychologists. If I&#39;m better read than he is, how much help is he really going to be?<br/>\n<br/>\n  And then when he read it, he was trying to use it to conform us to HIS way of parenting instead of understanding the change in thinking that has to occur. In other words, he was using the book to manipulate me instead of changing his own mindset.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We ditched him after my mother told me that many family based intensive therapists really do not need any experience or real training (as was told to her by friends of hers who actually did the job for a living and was also evident when she was asked if *she* would like to do the job...her degree is in English and American Studies, not even remotely close to therapy).  <br/>\n<br/>\n  We opted to go back to a psychologist friend that we know that seems a lot more helpful.  It was a good thing we ditched the &quot;family based&quot; counselor because as it turns out he is very pushy, even suggesting that the psychologist could &quot;supervise&quot; but that he, the social worker, wanted to stay involved...this after I made it clear we were not interested.  He even took the liberty of going to his superiors to ask if this was something he could do.  Unbelievable, but not surprising.  I&#39;m so glad we aren&#39;t seeing them again.  Whether or not we actually follow through with the psychologist remains to be seen. At this point, I think things are going much much better without any outside help.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And just so you know how much power these people have, I was told by the county MHMR (when they arranged the counseling) that if we ever wanted to quit, they *could* get a court order compelling us to continue, if they felt it was necessary, though they assured me they wouldn&#39;t ever do that (uh huh).  When I called to cancel any further counseling with them the MHMR caseworker informed me that our counselor was &quot;Very concerned about our family&quot; and &quot;felt it was necessary&quot; the buzz phrase for possible court action.  My guess is that since we stated we were going to a private psychologist, they decided we would be ok without them (sigh).   <br/>\n<br/>\n  Things are so much better without these people in our lives. I had a gut feeling that what my daughter really needed was for me to back off, not get even more in her face.  Having followed through on my gut, my daughter actually went to town cleaning the house the last two days without my asking her to.  I was overwhelmingly greatful for all that she did because I worked a lot this week and I really needed the help.  ANd I thanked her up and down and gave her a kiss for it, as well as some money she wanted to do something fun with her friends.  She also took the time to write down all her friends&#39; phone numbers where she could be reached since she ran up the cell phone minutes to the point where there aren&#39;t any free minutes left for anyone in the family now.  I thought that was very thoughtful.  I asked her if she could please just call me to let me know where she is, and she doesn&#39;t seem to think that will work, but at least I have phone numbers now where I can reach her.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway now that we&#39;ve detoxed our lives from these idiots (and I can&#39;t say enough about how awful it was...and it was even worse than I first thought, now looking back), we&#39;ve been able to get back to living and it is much less stressful.  And your post really helped because I can start to pinpoint where *I* get stressed, and where *I* can intervene to destress before I become angry.  I&#39;m hoping that will also help the kids to learn how to do that for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Some of what stresses me out is that my husband doesn&#39;t talk much and so he lets things irritate him and build up over time and then he&#39;s just plain mean and mutters and complains loud enough for all to hear, which makes me feel awful and guilty (which is his intention, as he&#39;s told me).  Very often what he&#39;s complaining about at that point has nothing to do with what he&#39;s actually upset about.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So we&#39;ve started talking almost every night about the day and if there was anything bothering him on that particular day and anything I can do to make it better in the future.  And I made it clear to him that his bottling things up and then letting off a long, sustained steam release has to stop because I can&#39;t live that way.  So we are both making a real effort to have a more pleasant life together.  I really appreciate his effort.  It makes me feel like he really does care about *me*.  And that helps to replenish me when I need it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n    From: Pamela Sorooshian <br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n    Sent: Saturday, January 28, 2006 2:09 PM<br/>\n    Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Mindfulness<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    On Jan 28, 2006, at 5:16 AM, Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n    &gt;&gt;  I know I&#39;ll be better for it when I finish my &quot;digesting&quot;...<br/>\n    &gt;&gt; not exactly sure &quot;where&quot; I&#39;ll be, but it will be closer.<br/>\n    &gt;<br/>\n    &gt; If you think of it as something you will digest and finish...  too<br/>\n    &gt; much like a project, a unit, a finite &quot;chore.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    You&#39;ll find out it is like a flower that keeps blooming into a more  <br/>\n    and more and more amazing flower - doesn&#39;t stop. Learning to parent  <br/>\n    feels to me like a time-lapse photo of a flower blooming - you keep  <br/>\n    thinking it is almost done but there is more. If you froze the frame  <br/>\n    it would be a flower - but there is all this potential still &quot;ungrown.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I was edgy and cranky and sharp with my kids several times yesterday.  <br/>\n    Rosie called me on it - said, &quot;Mom, why are you talking like that to  <br/>\n    Roxana?&quot; I really didn&#39;t even feel as cranky or sharp as it seems to  <br/>\n    have sounded to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n      I had a distressing day - started early and included seeing someone  <br/>\n    die in the street - someone in a wheelchair just suddenly careened  <br/>\n    off the sidewalk into the street and collapsed. Several people jumped  <br/>\n    out of cars to help - I was the next car back and didn&#39;t get out  <br/>\n    because I could see they were unable to do anything for her and had  <br/>\n    already called 911. I had my daughter and nephew with me and it was  <br/>\n    pretty awful, just sitting there (we were blocked in). I also had  <br/>\n    spent the morning at my nephew&#39;s private Christian school where they  <br/>\n    clearly taught the kids that only Christians could really love their  <br/>\n    country and that our freedom in this country is based on the Bible  <br/>\n    and on and on. It was depressing and unsettling to sit there.  Then I  <br/>\n    ran around to look for pretty hair clips/barrettes for Rosie who is  <br/>\n    going to a &quot;winter formal&quot; tonight and THAT was stressful because I  <br/>\n    didn&#39;t understand what she wanted, it was last minute rushed, I&#39;ve  <br/>\n    already spent a lot more money on this dance than I&#39;d realized it  <br/>\n    would cost when she first accepted the invitation. And I&#39;ve had a  <br/>\n    cold, on top of all that. And I hurt my knee playing Dance Dance  <br/>\n    Revolution last week and I&#39;d thought it was getting better, but it  <br/>\n    had started hurting a lot again and my whole leg was aching. I was  <br/>\n    feeling pressured and unsettled and unhealthy. And I was ignoring all  <br/>\n    that and just shoving it down all day while carrying on driving kids  <br/>\n    here and there, taking my nephew out to lunch (it was &quot;Grandparents  <br/>\n    Day&quot; at his school - so I was a stand-in since he has no living  <br/>\n    grandparents).<br/>\n<br/>\n    So then, late last night, I was finally home and the house was a mess  <br/>\n    and I was too tired to straighten up so I was sitting in the mess  <br/>\n    feeling annoyed that other people had made such a big mess and not  <br/>\n    cleaned up.<br/>\n<br/>\n    And Rosie was asking me to put her hair up in curlers but we couldn&#39;t  <br/>\n    find the curlers - this was about midnight and I&#39;d been up and on the  <br/>\n    go since 7 am.  Roxana thought the curlers were in her room - she  <br/>\n    went to look after being asked several times - was in there about a  <br/>\n    minute and came out saying she couldn&#39;t find them.<br/>\n<br/>\n    THAT is when I was sharp with her - I said, &quot;Could you look harder?&quot;  <br/>\n    She said, &quot;I DID look and I couldn&#39;t find them.&quot; I said, &quot;You could  <br/>\n    look harder - you were only in there about a minute and a half.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    Rosie said, &quot;MOM - why are you talking like that to Roxana?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    And 20 minutes later when we were in the other room, she said, again,  <br/>\n    &quot;You talked really mean to Roxana.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I really wasn&#39;t even aware of it, at the time. I was so tired. And  <br/>\n    what I&#39;d said was so much LESS than what I was thinking - I was  <br/>\n    THINKING - &quot;Sheesh - you sat here all day and played on your computer  <br/>\n    and didn&#39;t even pick up the messes that were sitting right in front  <br/>\n    of you. Could you at least put a little effort into helping find the  <br/>\n    curlers?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I was drained. I wanted to do all this stuff lovingly and sweetly,  <br/>\n    but I was worn out. I woke up this morning STILL feeling tired and  <br/>\n    drained.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I&#39;m human AND I make mistakes and sometimes I get in over my head and  <br/>\n    try to do too much. That&#39;s my weakness - it is my fault. It is my  <br/>\n    problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n    My kids want to do a lot and they want me involved. I don&#39;t always  <br/>\n    anticipate what the pacing is going to be like - things come up.  <br/>\n    Sometimes the littlest thing is what really stresses me out - like  <br/>\n    finding hair clips at the last minute, stores were closing, we had  <br/>\n    only a small window of time and I didn&#39;t know what she really wanted  <br/>\n    - I was on the cell phone in a store with her trying to explain it to  <br/>\n    me. Frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\n    So--- I&#39;ve written all that out because I don&#39;t want to come off  <br/>\n    sounding like I think I&#39;m perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Here is what I&#39;m doing about it. FIIRST - recognizing that this was  <br/>\n    my problem. I am at fault in that I didn&#39;t schedule well. I could  <br/>\n    tell myself that it wasn&#39;t my fault - I couldn&#39;t have anticipated  <br/>\n    much of what stressed me out - couldn&#39;t have planned for sitting in  <br/>\n    the car with two kids watching someone lie dead in the street,  <br/>\n    obviously. Couldn&#39;t anticipate that the girl doing Rosie&#39;s hair would  <br/>\n    suddenly need hair clips. I could blame LOTS of other people. But,  <br/>\n    truth is, I KNOW myself - ONLY I know what I can handle. I am  <br/>\n    responsible for building in enough time in my day for unexpected  <br/>\n    things to happen and not leave us super rushed. I am responsible for  <br/>\n    taking care of myself well enough that I can handle these kinds of  <br/>\n    stresses. I am the only person who could have known that when I left  <br/>\n    my nephew&#39;s school program that I was distressed over it. Nobody else  <br/>\n    could have possibly known that what I really needed at that point was  <br/>\n    to go home and straighten up the house and have a cup of tea and  <br/>\n    maybe read this list a bit. I was the only person who could know what  <br/>\n    I needed. So it makes no sense at all to blame anybody else or even  <br/>\n    to blame circumstances. I know that It was ME - I got myself into too  <br/>\n    much for one day. Recognizing and accepting that is a huge step.  <br/>\n    Without that step, I&#39;d make the same mistake over and over. Also, it  <br/>\n    helps me to look back and realize how many choices there were,  <br/>\n    throughout the day. I made some good ones and some bad ones. AND the  <br/>\n    whole day wasn&#39;t awful - there were many good parts to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n    SECOND - today I will apologize for being cranky last night. I can&#39;t  <br/>\n    undo it and will have regret that an apology won&#39;t wipe out, but  <br/>\n    it&#39;ll help for the kids to know that I am sorry, that it isn&#39;t how I  <br/>\n    want to be with them, and that it isn&#39;t THEM who brought it on.<br/>\n<br/>\n    THIRD - I recognize that I used to have days like yesterday FAR more  <br/>\n    frequently. In fact, underneath the crankiness was anger at myself  <br/>\n    because it felt like I&#39;d regressed to a more stressful way of living  <br/>\n    that I&#39;d left behind quite a while ago. There were little hardly  <br/>\n    conscious unformed thoughts like &quot;Didn&#39;t you learn anything?&quot; &quot;How  <br/>\n    could you have done this again?&quot; Self-recrimination all day long, off  <br/>\n    and on. But, the truth is, I hardly EVER have days like that anymore  <br/>\n    - I learned a lot about myself over the years and know how to keep  <br/>\n    far more centered and calm and happy. I know much more about what  <br/>\n    kind of pacing works well in my family and our lives are GOOD. I&#39;m  <br/>\n    not falling back into old habits just because I had one day that had  <br/>\n    a bunch of bad moments.<br/>\n<br/>\n    FOURTH - I know what I need to do and as soon as I finish this email,  <br/>\n    the next thing I&#39;ll do will be a preemptive strike against one of the  <br/>\n    things that can get me stressed. I&#39;m going to wash the dishes. I&#39;m  <br/>\n    going to ENJOY getting the kitchen all cleaned up - anticipating  <br/>\n    feeling that warm water flow over my hands and seeing the shiny sink  <br/>\n    at the end. It&#39;ll feel good to DO it and it&#39;ll feel good to have it  <br/>\n    done. Sounds trivial - wash the dishes - but I know myself and know  <br/>\n    that that will be a head-clearing move for me - a good way to start  <br/>\n    the day (yeah - it is almost 11 am and everybody else is still  <br/>\n    asleep). I&#39;m going to smile as each person wakes up - make tea for  <br/>\n    Cyrus, make breakfast for the kids. I&#39;m going to straighten up the  <br/>\n    house.<br/>\n<br/>\n    FIFTH - I&#39;m going to have a really low-key day - not going to do much  <br/>\n    other than putter around the house, cleaning up, hanging out.  <br/>\n    Recovery from yesterday might take a couple of days and I&#39;m going to  <br/>\n    GIVE myself that time - make sure i get it. I know it is important.<br/>\n<br/>\n    This was long. But I thought it might be useful for those just  <br/>\n    starting out on this journey to know that those of us who sound like  <br/>\n    we have all the answers, sometimes, also have struggles and how we  <br/>\n    have learned to respond. T<br/>\n<br/>\n    here is a line in a song in a show Roxana is doing - so I&#39;ve been  <br/>\n    hearing this song frequently -<br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot;Shoot the moon, shoot the moon. Life is hard and gone to soon.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    It keeps going through my head.<br/>\n<br/>\n    It means:<br/>\n      Give it all you&#39;ve got - get everything out of life that you can -  <br/>\n    take risks, don&#39;t be timid, LIVE your life fully. Life WILL give you  <br/>\n    some problems - things happen. But you don&#39;t have infinite time.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I think it is a good point. We don&#39;t have infinite time - we WILL  <br/>\n    have to deal with problems in life - but all the MORE reason to let  <br/>\n    GO of negative patterns that aren&#39;t working for us and take each  <br/>\n    moment as important and make those minute-by-minute choices that will  <br/>\n    give us a better life.<br/>\n<br/>\n    -pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n    YAHOO!

I almost decided not to do another semeseter, but at the last minute thought I&#39;d try one more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, this semester is going so much better.  The paperwork is a lot lighter than last semester so I&#39;m going to ask to do this course from now on (Nsg 206).  Im feeling much more relaxed about work, enough so that I can actually sign up for a few extra hours/week as a bedside nurse which means we will have extra money to do some fun things.  Next Friday I&#39;m taking the kids to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia  (thanks to whoever it was who posted the Happy Hollow membership information!!!).<br/>\n<br/>\nOur family was in counseling (long story) and I must say, things got so much worse during counseling.  The counselor really did not understand the unschooling mindset, often telling me my daughter needed more &quot;structure&quot; and that when she said she wanted a counselor who was more strict, he interpreted that to mean she wanted stricter parents. He also habitually would explain her behavior in terms of &quot;thats how it is with teen girls&quot; (which I dont&#39; buy). In addition he would often make comments about the fact that she was not in school and how that was going to make his job harder because they usually have team meetings with school officials (I wouldn&#39;t want that going on even if she *were* in school!).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he wanted more information about my kind of parenting I printed the article on unschooling.info about &quot;principles vs rules&quot; and I recommended he read &quot;Parent Teen Breakthrough....&quot;.  hen he told me he had never heard of the book, I knew we were in trouble because that book comes highly recommended by many family psychologists. If I&#39;m better read than he is, how much help is he really going to be?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then when he read it, he was trying to use it to conform us to HIS way of parenting instead of understanding the change in thinking that has to occur. In other words, he was using the book to manipulate me instead of changing his own mindset.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ditched him after my mother told me that many family based intensive therapists really do not need any experience or real training (as was told to her by friends of hers who actually did the job for a living and was also evident when she was asked if *she* would like to do the job...her degree is in English and American Studies, not even remotely close to therapy).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe opted to go back to a psychologist friend that we know that seems a lot more helpful.  It was a good thing we ditched the &quot;family based&quot; counselor because as it turns out he is very pushy, even suggesting that the psychologist could &quot;supervise&quot; but that he, the social worker, wanted to stay involved...this after I made it clear we were not interested.  He even took the liberty of going to his superiors to ask if this was something he could do.  Unbelievable, but not surprising.  I&#39;m so glad we aren&#39;t seeing them again.  Whether or not we actually follow through with the psychologist remains to be seen. At this point, I think things are going much much better without any outside help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just so you know how much power these people have, I was told by the county MHMR (when they arranged the counseling) that if we ever wanted to quit, they *could* get a court order compelling us to continue, if they felt it was necessary, though they assured me they wouldn&#39;t ever do that (uh huh).  When I called to cancel any further counseling with them the MHMR caseworker informed me that our counselor was &quot;Very concerned about our family&quot; and &quot;felt it was necessary&quot; the buzz phrase for possible court action.  My guess is that since we stated we were going to a private psychologist, they decided we would be ok without them (sigh).   <br/>\n<br/>\nThings are so much better without these people in our lives. I had a gut feeling that what my daughter really needed was for me to back off, not get even more in her face.  Having followed through on my gut, my daughter actually went to town cleaning the house the last two days without my asking her to.  I was overwhelmingly greatful for all that she did because I worked a lot this week and I really needed the help.  ANd I thanked her up and down and gave her a kiss for it, as well as some money she wanted to do something fun with her friends.  She also took the time to write down all her friends&#39; phone numbers where she could be reached since she ran up the cell phone minutes to the point where there aren&#39;t any free minutes left for anyone in the family now.  I thought that was very thoughtful.  I asked her if she could please just call me to let me know where she is, and she doesn&#39;t seem to think that will work, but at least I have phone numbers now where I can reach her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway now that we&#39;ve detoxed our lives from these idiots (and I can&#39;t say enough about how awful it was...and it was even worse than I first thought, now looking back), we&#39;ve been able to get back to living and it is much less stressful.  And your post really helped because I can start to pinpoint where *I* get stressed, and where *I* can intervene to destress before I become angry.  I&#39;m hoping that will also help the kids to learn how to do that for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of what stresses me out is that my husband doesn&#39;t talk much and so he lets things irritate him and build up over time and then he&#39;s just plain mean and mutters and complains loud enough for all to hear, which makes me feel awful and guilty (which is his intention, as he&#39;s told me).  Very often what he&#39;s complaining about at that point has nothing to do with what he&#39;s actually upset about.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we&#39;ve started talking almost every night about the day and if there was anything bothering him on that particular day and anything I can do to make it better in the future.  And I made it clear to him that his bottling things up and then letting off a long, sustained steam release has to stop because I can&#39;t live that way.  So we are both making a real effort to have a more pleasant life together.  I really appreciate his effort.  It makes me feel like he really does care about *me*.  And that helps to replenish me when I need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Pamela Sorooshian <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, January 28, 2006 2:09 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Mindfulness<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  On Jan 28, 2006, at 5:16 AM, Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;  I know I&#39;ll be better for it when I finish my &quot;digesting&quot;...<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; not exactly sure &quot;where&quot; I&#39;ll be, but it will be closer.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; If you think of it as something you will digest and finish...  too<br/>\n  &gt; much like a project, a unit, a finite &quot;chore.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  You&#39;ll find out it is like a flower that keeps blooming into a more  <br/>\n  and more and more amazing flower - doesn&#39;t stop.

If you froze the frame  <br/>\n  it would be a flower - but there is all this potential still &quot;ungrown.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was edgy and cranky and sharp with my kids several times yesterday.  <br/>\n  Rosie called me on it - said, &quot;Mom, why are you talking like that to  <br/>\n  Roxana?&quot; I really didn&#39;t even feel as cranky or sharp as it seems to  <br/>\n  have sounded to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I had a distressing day - started early and included seeing someone  <br/>\n  die in the street - someone in a wheelchair just suddenly careened  <br/>\n  off the sidewalk into the street and collapsed. Several people jumped  <br/>\n  out of cars to help - I was the next car back and didn&#39;t get out  <br/>\n  because I could see they were unable to do anything for her and had  <br/>\n  already called 911. I had my daughter and nephew with me and it was  <br/>\n  pretty awful, just sitting there (we were blocked in). I also had  <br/>\n  spent the morning at my nephew&#39;s private Christian school where they  <br/>\n  clearly taught the kids that only Christians could really love their  <br/>\n  country and that our freedom in this country is based on the Bible  <br/>\n  and on and on. It was depressing and unsettling to sit there.  Then I  <br/>\n  ran around to look for pretty hair clips/barrettes for Rosie who is  <br/>\n  going to a &quot;winter formal&quot; tonight and THAT was stressful because I  <br/>\n  didn&#39;t understand what she wanted, it was last minute rushed, I&#39;ve  <br/>\n  already spent a lot more money on this dance than I&#39;d realized it  <br/>\n  would cost when she first accepted the invitation. And I&#39;ve had a  <br/>\n  cold, on top of all that. And I hurt my knee playing Dance Dance  <br/>\n  Revolution last week and I&#39;d thought it was getting better, but it  <br/>\n  had started hurting a lot again and my whole leg was aching. I was  <br/>\n  feeling pressured and unsettled and unhealthy. And I was ignoring all  <br/>\n  that and just shoving it down all day while carrying on driving kids  <br/>\n  here and there, taking my nephew out to lunch (it was &quot;Grandparents  <br/>\n  Day&quot; at his school - so I was a stand-in since he has no living  <br/>\n  grandparents).<br/>\n<br/>\n  So then, late last night, I was finally home and the house was a mess  <br/>\n  and I was too tired to straighten up so I was sitting in the mess  <br/>\n  feeling annoyed that other people had made such a big mess and not  <br/>\n  cleaned up.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And Rosie was asking me to put her hair up in curlers but we couldn&#39;t  <br/>\n  find the curlers - this was about midnight and I&#39;d been up and on the  <br/>\n  go since 7 am.  Roxana thought the curlers were in her room - she  <br/>\n  went to look after being asked several times - was in there about a  <br/>\n  minute and came out saying she couldn&#39;t find them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  THAT is when I was sharp with her - I said, &quot;Could you look harder?&quot;  <br/>\n  She said, &quot;I DID look and I couldn&#39;t find them.&quot; I said, &quot;You could  <br/>\n  look harder - you were only in there about a minute and a half.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Rosie said, &quot;MOM - why are you talking like that to Roxana?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  And 20 minutes later when we were in the other room, she said, again,  <br/>\n  &quot;You talked really mean to Roxana.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I really wasn&#39;t even aware of it, at the time. I was so tired. And  <br/>\n  what I&#39;d said was so much LESS than what I was thinking - I was  <br/>\n  THINKING - &quot;Sheesh - you sat here all day and played on your computer  <br/>\n  and didn&#39;t even pick up the messes that were sitting right in front  <br/>\n  of you. Could you at least put a little effort into helping find the  <br/>\n  curlers?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was drained. I wanted to do all this stuff lovingly and sweetly,  <br/>\n  but I was worn out. I woke up this morning STILL feeling tired and  <br/>\n  drained.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m human AND I make mistakes and sometimes I get in over my head and  <br/>\n  try to do too much. That&#39;s my weakness - it is my fault. It is my  <br/>\n  problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My kids want to do a lot and they want me involved. I don&#39;t always  <br/>\n  anticipate what the pacing is going to be like - things come up.  <br/>\n  Sometimes the littlest thing is what really stresses me out - like  <br/>\n  finding hair clips at the last minute, stores were closing, we had  <br/>\n  only a small window of time and I didn&#39;t know what she really wanted  <br/>\n  - I was on the cell phone in a store with her trying to explain it to  <br/>\n  me. Frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So--- I&#39;ve written all that out because I don&#39;t want to come off  <br/>\n  sounding like I think I&#39;m perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Here is what I&#39;m doing about it. FIIRST - recognizing that this was  <br/>\n  my problem. I am at fault in that I didn&#39;t schedule well. I could  <br/>\n  tell myself that it wasn&#39;t my fault - I couldn&#39;t have anticipated  <br/>\n  much of what stressed me out - couldn&#39;t have planned for sitting in  <br/>\n  the car with two kids watching someone lie dead in the street,  <br/>\n  obviously. Couldn&#39;t anticipate that the girl doing Rosie&#39;s hair would  <br/>\n  suddenly need hair clips. I could blame LOTS of other people. But,  <br/>\n  truth is, I KNOW myself - ONLY I know what I can handle. I am  <br/>\n  responsible for building in enough time in my day for unexpected  <br/>\n  things to happen and not leave us super rushed. I am responsible for  <br/>\n  taking care of myself well enough that I can handle these kinds of  <br/>\n  stresses. I am the only person who could have known that when I left  <br/>\n  my nephew&#39;s school program that I was distressed over it. Nobody else  <br/>\n  could have possibly known that what I really needed at that point was  <br/>\n  to go home and straighten up the house and have a cup of tea and  <br/>\n  maybe read this list a bit. I was the only person who could know what  <br/>\n  I needed. So it makes no sense at all to blame anybody else or even  <br/>\n  to blame circumstances. I know that It was ME - I got myself into too  <br/>\n  much for one day. Recognizing and accepting that is a huge step.  <br/>\n  Without that step, I&#39;d make the same mistake over and over. Also, it  <br/>\n  helps me to look back and realize how many choices there were,  <br/>\n  throughout the day. I made some good ones and some bad ones. AND the  <br/>\n  whole day wasn&#39;t awful - there were many good parts to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  SECOND - today I will apologize for being cranky last night. I can&#39;t  <br/>\n  undo it and will have regret that an apology won&#39;t wipe out, but  <br/>\n  it&#39;ll help for the kids to know that I am sorry, that it isn&#39;t how I  <br/>\n  want to be with them, and that it isn&#39;t THEM who brought it on.<br/>\n<br/>\n  THIRD - I recognize that I used to have days like yesterday FAR more  <br/>\n  frequently. In fact, underneath the crankiness was anger at myself  <br/>\n  because it felt like I&#39;d regressed to a more stressful way of living  <br/>\n  that I&#39;d left behind quite a while ago. There were little hardly  <br/>\n  conscious unformed thoughts like &quot;Didn&#39;t you learn anything?&quot; &quot;How  <br/>\n  could you have done this again?&quot; Self-recrimination all day long, off  <br/>\n  and on. But, the truth is, I hardly EVER have days like that anymore  <br/>\n  - I learned a lot about myself over the years and know how to keep  <br/>\n  far more centered and calm and happy. I know much more about what  <br/>\n  kind of pacing works well in my family and our lives are GOOD. I&#39;m  <br/>\n  not falling back into old habits just because I had one day that had  <br/>\n  a bunch of bad moments.<br/>\n<br/>\n  FOURTH - I know what I need to do and as soon as I finish this email,  <br/>\n  the next thing I&#39;ll do will be a preemptive strike against one of the  <br/>\n  things that can get me stressed. I&#39;m going to wash the dishes. I&#39;m  <br/>\n  going to ENJOY getting the kitchen all cleaned up - anticipating  <br/>\n  feeling that warm water flow over my hands and seeing the shiny sink  <br/>\n  at the end. It&#39;ll feel good to DO it and it&#39;ll feel good to have it  <br/>\n  done. Sounds trivial - wash the dishes - but I know myself and know  <br/>\n  that that will be a head-clearing move for me - a good way to start  <br/>\n  the day (yeah - it is almost 11 am and everybody else is still  <br/>\n  asleep). I&#39;m going to smile as each person wakes up - make tea for  <br/>\n  Cyrus, make breakfast for the kids. I&#39;m going to straighten up the  <br/>\n  house.<br/>\n<br/>\n  FIFTH - I&#39;m going to have a really low-key day - not going to do much  <br/>\n  other than putter around the house, cleaning up, hanging out.  <br/>\n  Recovery from yesterday might take a couple of days and I&#39;m going to  <br/>\n  GIVE myself that time - make sure i get it. I know it is important.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This was long. But I thought it might be useful for those just  <br/>\n  starting out on this journey to know that those of us who sound like  <br/>\n  we have all the answers, sometimes, also have struggles and how we  <br/>\n  have learned to respond. T<br/>\n<br/>\n  here is a line in a song in a show Roxana is doing - so I&#39;ve been  <br/>\n  hearing this song frequently -<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Shoot the moon, shoot the moon. Life is hard and gone to soon.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  It keeps going through my head.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It means:<br/>\n    Give it all you&#39;ve got - get everything out of life that you can -  <br/>\n  take risks, don&#39;t be timid, LIVE your life fully. Life WILL give you  <br/>\n  some problems - things happen. But you don&#39;t have infinite time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think it is a good point. We don&#39;t have infinite time - we WILL  <br/>\n  have to deal with problems in life - but all the MORE reason to let  <br/>\n  GO of negative patterns that aren&#39;t working for us and take each  <br/>\n  moment as important and make those minute-by-minute choices that will  <br/>\n  give us a better life.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

Roxana thought the curlers were in her room - she  <br/>\nwent to look after being asked several times - was in there about a  <br/>\nminute and came out saying she couldn&#39;t find them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHAT is when I was sharp with her - I said, &quot;Could you look harder?&quot;  <br/>\nShe said, &quot;I DID look and I couldn&#39;t find them.&quot; I said, &quot;You could  <br/>\nlook harder - you were only in there about a minute and a half.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRosie said, &quot;MOM - why are you talking like that to Roxana?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd 20 minutes later when we were in the other room, she said, again,  <br/>\n&quot;You talked really mean to Roxana.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI really wasn&#39;t even aware of it, at the time. I was so tired. And  <br/>\nwhat I&#39;d said was so much LESS than what I was thinking - I was  <br/>\nTHINKING - &quot;Sheesh - you sat here all day and played on your computer  <br/>\nand didn&#39;t even pick up the messes that were sitting right in front  <br/>\nof you. Could you at least put a little effort into helping find the  <br/>\ncurlers?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was drained. I wanted to do all this stuff lovingly and sweetly,  <br/>\nbut I was worn out. I woke up this morning STILL feeling tired and  <br/>\ndrained.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m human AND I make mistakes and sometimes I get in over my head and  <br/>\ntry to do too much. That&#39;s my weakness - it is my fault. It is my  <br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids want to do a lot and they want me involved. I don&#39;t always  <br/>\nanticipate what the pacing is going to be like - things come up.  <br/>\nSometimes the littlest thing is what really stresses me out - like  <br/>\nfinding hair clips at the last minute, stores were closing, we had  <br/>\nonly a small window of time and I didn&#39;t know what she really wanted  <br/>\n- I was on the cell phone in a store with her trying to explain it to  <br/>\nme. Frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo--- I&#39;ve written all that out because I don&#39;t want to come off  <br/>\nsounding like I think I&#39;m perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what I&#39;m doing about it. FIIRST - recognizing that this was  <br/>\nmy problem. I am at fault in that I didn&#39;t schedule well. I could  <br/>\ntell myself that it wasn&#39;t my fault - I couldn&#39;t have anticipated  <br/>\nmuch of what stressed me out - couldn&#39;t have planned for sitting in  <br/>\nthe car with two kids watching someone lie dead in the street,  <br/>\nobviously. Couldn&#39;t anticipate that the girl doing Rosie&#39;s hair would  <br/>\nsuddenly need hair clips. I could blame LOTS of other people. But,  <br/>\ntruth is, I KNOW myself - ONLY I know what I can handle. I am  <br/>\nresponsible for building in enough time in my day for unexpected  <br/>\nthings to happen and not leave us super rushed. I am responsible for  <br/>\ntaking care of myself well enough that I can handle these kinds of  <br/>\nstresses. I am the only person who could have known that when I left  <br/>\nmy nephew&#39;s school program that I was distressed over it. Nobody else  <br/>\ncould have possibly known that what I really needed at that point was  <br/>\nto go home and straighten up the house and have a cup of tea and  <br/>\nmaybe read this list a bit. I was the only person who could know what  <br/>\nI needed. So it makes no sense at all to blame anybody else or even  <br/>\nto blame circumstances. I know that It was ME - I got myself into too  <br/>\nmuch for one day. Recognizing and accepting that is a huge step.  <br/>\nWithout that step, I&#39;d make the same mistake over and over. Also, it  <br/>\nhelps me to look back and realize how many choices there were,  <br/>\nthroughout the day. I made some good ones and some bad ones. AND the  <br/>\nwhole day wasn&#39;t awful - there were many good parts to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSECOND - today I will apologize for being cranky last night. I can&#39;t  <br/>\nundo it and will have regret that an apology won&#39;t wipe out, but  <br/>\nit&#39;ll help for the kids to know that I am sorry, that it isn&#39;t how I  <br/>\nwant to be with them, and that it isn&#39;t THEM who brought it on.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHIRD - I recognize that I used to have days like yesterday FAR more  <br/>\nfrequently. In fact, underneath the crankiness was anger at myself  <br/>\nbecause it felt like I&#39;d regressed to a more stressful way of living  <br/>\nthat I&#39;d left behind quite a while ago. There were little hardly  <br/>\nconscious unformed thoughts like &quot;Didn&#39;t you learn anything?&quot; &quot;How  <br/>\ncould you have done this again?&quot; Self-recrimination all day long, off  <br/>\nand on. But, the truth is, I hardly EVER have days like that anymore  <br/>\n- I learned a lot about myself over the years and know how to keep  <br/>\nfar more centered and calm and happy. I know much more about what  <br/>\nkind of pacing works well in my family and our lives are GOOD. I&#39;m  <br/>\nnot falling back into old habits just because I had one day that had  <br/>\na bunch of bad moments.<br/>\n<br/>\nFOURTH - I know what I need to do and as soon as I finish this email,  <br/>\nthe next thing I&#39;ll do will be a preemptive strike against one of the  <br/>\nthings that can get me stressed. I&#39;m going to wash the dishes. I&#39;m  <br/>\ngoing to ENJOY getting the kitchen all cleaned up - anticipating  <br/>\nfeeling that warm water flow over my hands and seeing the shiny sink  <br/>\nat the end. It&#39;ll feel good to DO it and it&#39;ll feel good to have it  <br/>\ndone. Sounds trivial - wash the dishes - but I know myself and know  <br/>\nthat that will be a head-clearing move for me - a good way to start  <br/>\nthe day (yeah - it is almost 11 am and everybody else is still  <br/>\nasleep). I&#39;m going to smile as each person wakes up - make tea for  <br/>\nCyrus, make breakfast for the kids. I&#39;m going to straighten up the  <br/>\nhouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nFIFTH - I&#39;m going to have a really low-key day - not going to do much  <br/>\nother than putter around the house, cleaning up, hanging out.  <br/>\nRecovery from yesterday might take a couple of days and I&#39;m going to  <br/>\nGIVE myself that time - make sure i get it. I know it is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was long. But I thought it might be useful for those just  <br/>\nstarting out on this journey to know that those of us who sound like  <br/>\nwe have all the answers, sometimes, also have struggles and how we  <br/>\nhave learned to respond. T<br/>\n<br/>\nhere is a line in a song in a show Roxana is doing - so I&#39;ve been  <br/>\nhearing this song frequently -<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Shoot the moon, shoot the moon. Life is hard and gone to soon.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt keeps going through my head.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt means:<br/>\n  Give it all you&#39;ve got - get everything out of life that you can -  <br/>\ntake risks, don&#39;t be timid, LIVE your life fully. Life WILL give you  <br/>\nsome problems - things happen. But you don&#39;t have infinite time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is a good point. We don&#39;t have infinite time - we WILL  <br/>\nhave to deal with problems in life - but all the MORE reason to let  <br/>\nGO of negative patterns that aren&#39;t working for us and take each  <br/>\nmoment as important and make those minute-by-minute choices that will  <br/>\ngive us a better life.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59925222,"authorName":"queenjane555","from":"&quot;queenjane555&quot; &lt;queenjane555@...&gt;","profile":"queenjane555","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Mindfulness","postDate":"1138473662","msgId":111547,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRyZ2RydStiZ2IwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTI4MTc0NzM1LjgwMTc3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMzEyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":111546,"nextInTopic":111548,"prevInTime":111546,"nextInTime":111548,"topicId":111505,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I believe that is a huge part of the healing, and<br/>\n  something Sandra and I talk about in that article mentioned...the<br/>\n  focus was about the healing aspects of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooling, in a very real sense, IS a mindfulness practice.:)<br/>\n  Being in the moment with our children, trusting the flow of life,<br/>\n  seeing our connections to them and to all of the universe etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think my greatest breakthrough moment (or paradiagm shift) was about<br/>\n  acceptance. In Zen practice, the idea is to simply notice things,<br/>\n  without all the judgement and preferences attached to the noticing.<br/>\n  Sort of like a reflecting pool.<br/>\n  If you can see the mess around you, feel some angst welling up and<br/>\n  instead of reacting to those initial feelings, you just NOTICE the<br/>\n  angst. You NOTICE your anger, your emotions. Kind of like a visitor<br/>\n  standing off to the side and watching.<br/>\n  If you stay with the feeling, just noticing that you are having these<br/>\n  strong emotions, pretty soon you&#39;ll find that the emotion subside<br/>\n  quite a bit and you&#39;re able to think more clearly about what action<br/>\n  would make sense in the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m using chaotic mess as an example, because that&#39;s a trigger for me<br/>\n  sometimes..... what I&#39;ve found is that whatever I&#39;m reacting to, is<br/>\n  not really what I&#39;m reacting to. Clear as mud?<br/>\n  Mess is not what makes me angry, it&#39;s feelings of being ignored,<br/>\n  undervalued etc...when I really examine it (how can they just trash<br/>\n  the kitchen when I just cleaned it up? Don&#39;t they care?)<br/>\n<br/>\n  There&#39;s always some underlying thing that is the trigger for the<br/>\n  emotion when I examine it more carefully.  So letting the emotion<br/>\n  arise (don&#39;t fight it, don&#39;t tell yourself you shouldn&#39;t feel it,<br/>\n  that&#39;s trying to hard to CONTROL again) noticing it and just staying<br/>\n  with the feeling for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think in previous times, I was always fighting myself to try and<br/>\n  change. That doesn&#39;t work so well.  Mindfulness DOES change what you<br/>\n  react to, but it happens so quietly and naturally you hardly realize<br/>\n  it. A moment happens that is so drastically different than how you<br/>\n  WOULD have reacted in the past and it&#39;s almost like a slap (a good<br/>\n  slap) and you&#39;re thinking &quot;WOW&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So accepting your emotions, feeling them, and staying with them until<br/>\n  some clarity swirls up is much better than trying to stop yourself<br/>\n  from feeling anger (or whatever emotion wells up).  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I will always remember something Richard Prystowsky said about being a<br/>\n  peaceful parent on the tape from he and Sandra&#39;s talk a few years<br/>\n  back; something about the way to BECOME a peaceful parent was to BE<br/>\n  peaceful. There was no path, you just had to BE peaceful.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s really that simple. Slow down and make room for peace amongst all<br/>\n  the mess and fun and tasks and STUFF.  All of that daily stuff IS your<br/>\n  practice, so make it peaceful and happy and there ya go!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ren<br/>\n  learninginfreedom.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

I believe that is a huge part of the healing, and<br/>\nsomething Sandra and I talk about in that article mentioned...the<br/>\nfocus was about the healing aspects of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling, in a very real sense, IS a mindfulness practice.:)<br/>\nBeing in the moment with our children, trusting the flow of life,<br/>\nseeing our connections to them and to all of the universe etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my greatest breakthrough moment (or paradiagm shift) was about<br/>\nacceptance. In Zen practice, the idea is to simply notice things,<br/>\nwithout all the judgement and preferences attached to the noticing.<br/>\nSort of like a reflecting pool.<br/>\nIf you can see the mess around you, feel some angst welling up and<br/>\ninstead of reacting to those initial feelings, you just NOTICE the<br/>\nangst. You NOTICE your anger, your emotions. Kind of like a visitor<br/>\nstanding off to the side and watching.<br/>\nIf you stay with the feeling, just noticing that you are having these<br/>\nstrong emotions, pretty soon you&#39;ll find that the emotion subside<br/>\nquite a bit and you&#39;re able to think more clearly about what action<br/>\nwould make sense in the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m using chaotic mess as an example, because that&#39;s a trigger for me<br/>\nsometimes..... what I&#39;ve found is that whatever I&#39;m reacting to, is<br/>\nnot really what I&#39;m reacting to. Clear as mud?<br/>\nMess is not what makes me angry, it&#39;s feelings of being ignored,<br/>\nundervalued etc...when I really examine it (how can they just trash<br/>\nthe kitchen when I just cleaned it up? Don&#39;t they care?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s always some underlying thing that is the trigger for the<br/>\nemotion when I examine it more carefully.  So letting the emotion<br/>\narise (don&#39;t fight it, don&#39;t tell yourself you shouldn&#39;t feel it,<br/>\nthat&#39;s trying to hard to CONTROL again) noticing it and just staying<br/>\nwith the feeling for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in previous times, I was always fighting myself to try and<br/>\nchange. That doesn&#39;t work so well.  Mindfulness DOES change what you<br/>\nreact to, but it happens so quietly and naturally you hardly realize<br/>\nit. A moment happens that is so drastically different than how you<br/>\nWOULD have reacted in the past and it&#39;s almost like a slap (a good<br/>\nslap) and you&#39;re thinking &quot;WOW&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo accepting your emotions, feeling them, and staying with them until<br/>\nsome clarity swirls up is much better than trying to stop yourself<br/>\nfrom feeling anger (or whatever emotion wells up).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI will always remember something Richard Prystowsky said about being a<br/>\npeaceful parent on the tape from he and Sandra&#39;s talk a few years<br/>\nback; something about the way to BECOME a peaceful parent was to BE<br/>\npeaceful. There was no path, you just had to BE peaceful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really that simple. Slow down and make room for peace amongst all<br/>\nthe mess and fun and tasks and STUFF.  All of that daily stuff IS your<br/>\npractice, so make it peaceful and happy and there ya go!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Mindfulness","postDate":"1138454216","msgId":111537,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFFQUQyREE5LUEyODktNDk5My1BNzk5LTI1RjkyNDg4NDY3RUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDI2Mi40YzU5YmJhLjMxMGNjMGI1QGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDI2Mi40YzU5YmJhLjMxMGNjMGI1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":111533,"nextInTopic":111538,"prevInTime":111536,"nextInTime":111538,"topicId":111505,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That&#39;s not a bad thing.  It&#39;s why people  <br/>\nclean their yards, and get new clothes, and make birthday cakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s why moms want to be better moms.  And it all does happen  <br/>\ninside.  And it happens right where people are.  Just like learning,  <br/>\nbecause it is learning.  Kids have all their lives to learn 6x9, but  <br/>\nmoms only have a little while to become better moms, or their kids  <br/>\nwill be grown.  That&#39;s why there&#39;s more urgency when a mom wants to  <br/>\nlearn how to be a better mom.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandradodd.com/peace/becoming.html\">http://www.sandradodd.com/peace/becoming.html</a><br/>\nPam Sorooshian answered a question on this list a while back.  The  <br/>\nquestion was<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; How do you go from a very verbally reactive person<br/>\n &gt; to one who takes a few moments to calm down before she speaks or<br/>\n &gt; acts? How do you change for good, and not just for days or<br/>\n &gt; moments? Practice, I guess? Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pam wrote:<br/>\nStop thinking about changing &quot;for good and not just for days or  <br/>\nmoments.&quot; That is just another thing to overwhelm you and you don&#39;t  <br/>\nneed that!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust change the next interaction you have with the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nStop reading email right now and do something &quot;preventative&quot; -  <br/>\nsomething that helps build your relationship with them. Fix them a  <br/>\nlittle tray of cheese and crackers and take it to them, wherever they  <br/>\nare, unasked. Sit down on the floor and play with them. If nothing  <br/>\nelse, just go and give each of them a little hug and a kiss and say,  <br/>\n&quot;I was just thinking about how much I love you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay - so that is one good, positive interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain - just change the next interaction you have with the kids.  <br/>\nFocus on making the next interaction another one that builds up your  <br/>\nrelationship. If the next one is because the kids are fighting, STILL  <br/>\nkeep in mind that you want this interaction to do something positive  <br/>\nfor your relationship with the kids and stretch your thinking as to  <br/>\nhow you can make that happen. In other words, you kind of think from  <br/>\ntheir point of view about yourself. Consider what thoughts you want  <br/>\ngoing through their head. Do you want them thinking: &quot;She never takes  <br/>\ntime to even find out what the problem is?&quot; Or, &quot;She always blames  <br/>\nme?&quot; Or, &quot;She&#39;s such a hypocrite, doesn&#39;t want to hear us yelling,  <br/>\nbut then she yells at us.&quot; &quot;She hates me.&quot; And so on.<br/>\nWhat do you want them to be thinking - what words (articulated or  <br/>\nnot) do want tumbling around inside their head? Maybe, &quot;She  <br/>\nunderstands how I feel.&quot; Or, &quot;She really cares about helping us solve  <br/>\nour problems.&quot; Or, &quot;She is trying hard to be fair.&quot; Or, &quot;She&#39;s calm  <br/>\neven when I&#39;m not.&quot; Or, &quot;Mom is the best listener in the world.&quot; &quot;Mom  <br/>\nloves me even when I&#39;m causing problems.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, eventually, you want them to think like this?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Mom will help us find a solution.&quot; &quot;I can stay calm like mommy does  <br/>\neven when I&#39;m mad.&quot; &quot;I can listen carefully like mommy does when  <br/>\nthere is a conflict.&quot; &quot;I can recognize feelings, like mommy.&quot; &quot;I can  <br/>\ncome up with new ideas, like mommy does when we have trouble.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no substitute for being authentically &quot;there&quot; for them � for  <br/>\ngenuinely trying to help them resolve problems. For putting your  <br/>\nrelationship with them at the forefront of every interaction, whether  <br/>\nit is playing together or working together.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of us are perfect � we&#39;ll all have some regrets. But with my  <br/>\nkids 19, 16, and 13, I can now say that I will never say anything  <br/>\nlike, &quot;I wish I&#39;d let them fight it out more,&quot; or &quot;I wish I&#39;d  <br/>\npunished them more,&quot; or &quot;I wish I&#39;d yelled at them more.&quot; I will only  <br/>\never say that I wish I&#39;d been more patient, more attentive, more calm  <br/>\nand accepting of the normal stresses of having young children.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne interaction at a time.
