I believe he was saying that this is the part of the brain that<br/>\ncommunicates with the heart (whose major function is really neurological --<br/>\n60-65% of the heart cells are neurons.)  So potentially, the major<br/>\ndevelopment from 15-21 is for universal or heart connections.  Certainly<br/>\nlooking at the world from a different perspective than most of us do.  The<br/>\nother key to developing our potential is that we need living models, so the<br/>\nbody can entrain with someone who is actually using or experiencing the<br/>\nparts of the brain/heart which are being developed in the child/young adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also another major growth spurt at 21, which he suggests is where<br/>\nwe are evolutionarily designed to go... but don&#39;t make it because of the<br/>\nlack of entrainment within our cultures.  We never really get to the point<br/>\nwhere we are using our prefrontal and our heart minds, so who knows what<br/>\nwould be possible!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s no wonder that teenagers are crazy.
