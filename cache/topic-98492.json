For someone<br/>\nworking a night shift, brushing before he/she goes to bed in the morning<br/>\nis the critical time but for most of us bedtime is nighttime.  I was<br/>\nresponding to your statement &quot;Why should tooth brushing have to be right<br/>\nbefore bed? If they brush a couple of times a day, it&#39;s not going to<br/>\nmatter what time it was.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does matter, for a couple of reasons.<br/>\n1.  If you brush just before a meal, and not after, the sugar and residue<br/>\nstays on your teeth until you clean them somehow (by brushing, eating an<br/>\napple, chewing some anti-decay gum, etc.).  Brushing after breakfast is<br/>\nbetter than brushing before.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  At night, most of us sleep with our mouths closed (except for the<br/>\noccasional snore) and the bacteria grow rapidly on the food that is left<br/>\non the teeth.  We aren&#39;t eating any apples or chewing gum or removing the<br/>\nplaque.  This advice came directly from our dental hygienist but I found a<br/>\nlink to offer evidence:  &quot;Always brush your teeth before you go to bed<br/>\nbecause we produce less saliva during our sleep and are more prone to<br/>\ndamage from bacteria.&quot; <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kristensguide.tripod.com/Health/Getting_Healthy/Grooming_Habits/brush_teeth.htm\">http://kristensguide.tripod.com/Health/Getting_Healthy/Grooming_Habits/brush_teeth.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShannon R.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175367753,"authorName":"yukonaurora65","from":"&quot;yukonaurora65&quot; &lt;nadineb@...&gt;","profile":"yukonaurora65","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Getting fat and cavities","postDate":"1093017174","msgId":98566,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNnNTZvbStsdnBrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxMzYwMWM0ODY0MCQ1NGZmZGRhMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBybWJ3YzE+"},"prevInTopic":98565,"nextInTopic":98567,"prevInTime":98565,"nextInTime":98567,"topicId":98492,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just a couple of thoughts about teeth-in my house battery operated toothbrushes are a big hit.

I wasn&#39;t interested in THAT diet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t know and still don&#39;t know which of our kids might inherit what.   <br/>\nAt this snapshot moment it seems Kirby is pudging and the others aren&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have done is never try to help ANY of them define themselves or their <br/>\nworth by their appearance.  When Holly is in a totally cute phase, I remind <br/>\nher (gently) that looks don&#39;t always last so don&#39;t bank on it or get mad when <br/>\nyou change, because change is natural.   She sees people who stayed <br/>\nphotogenically cute for life, and some who never were cute, and some who&#39;ve gone through <br/>\ndifferent phases.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Kirby has that Keith didn&#39;t have is a lack of shame and teasing.  He <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to deal with schoolkids, and we haven&#39;t changed his life or ours out <br/>\nof that one weight issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF people are different, and IF averages are to be averages, there will be <br/>\npeople on both ends of the measure.  It&#39;s natural.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool and society teaches us that being average is a worthy goal.  And from <br/>\nthat pool of average, a few exceptions will get rich and famous (i.e. &quot;be <br/>\nsuccessful&quot;) but first you must be average. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just doesn&#39;t apply to our way of thinking these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby&#39;s spent the week in Los Alamos (90 miles away) with kids a year or two <br/>\nolder than he is, a batch of friends he&#39;s known for a few years.   They&#39;re all <br/>\nin college. They have parents with hotshot science jobs.  They like Kirby a <br/>\nLOT.   <br/>\n<br/>\nKirby came home Wednesday to work a shift, before going back up there to <br/>\nfinish the week before they all go back off to their sophomore years of college.   <br/>\nHe told me one of the dads said, &quot;So how does it feel to be the most popular <br/>\nguy in town?&quot; and that the same dad said he had hoped to play some games with <br/>\nKirby (both are board game collectors), and Kirby should come back up there <br/>\nwhen there aren&#39;t a bunch of girls around.     (He&#39;s the dad of the girl who <br/>\ninvited Kirby to the prom, and we&#39;ve known him a long time.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes parents put a child&#39;s weight ahead of other issues, and the other <br/>\nissues don&#39;t stand a chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":149995806,"authorName":"catherine aceto","from":"&quot;catherine aceto&quot; &lt;aceto3@...&gt;","profile":"cat4cat15217","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Getting fat and cavities","postDate":"1093007696","msgId":98548,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxOGUwMWM0ODZiNyRiMDlmM2VlMCQ3MDAyYThjMEAyMDAyZGVza3RvcD4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwOTI5NDAyODAuMTQ5OC45NzQwMy5tMjFAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDEzNjAxYzQ4NjQwJDU0ZmZkZGEwJDY0MDFhOGMwQHJtYndjMT4gPEExNTk1RUVBLUYyNEEtMTFEOC1CRDczLTAwMEE5NUMzQzMzQUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":98546,"nextInTopic":98555,"prevInTime":98547,"nextInTime":98549,"topicId":98492,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My children self-regulate with food (and have since birth).

They are now 6.5 and 1.5.   Lydia, the 6.5 yo,  has had one &quot;cavity&quot; filled, deep between her teeth -- I put it in quotes, though, because shortly thereafter we switched dentists and the new dentists said that it had probably not been a cavity after all, based on his review of the Lydia&#39;s x-rays, which he said had been overlapped improperly.  The 1.5 yo hasn&#39;t been to the dentist yet. <br/>\n<br/>\n Both kids are in the middle of the charts for height/weight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other weekend when we were camping for the weekend with our playgroup, Lydia roasted herself maybe 4 marshmellows the first night -- then roasted them for other people until she couldn&#39;t find anyone else who still wanted one.  The second night, she made and ate one &#39;smore, then asked for some chicken and then an apple.   Jonathan ate maybe 3 marshmellows each night (unroasted) and then sat on my lap watching the campfire and nursing. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe came home with a bag of marshmellows.  Lydia said that she really liked it when they were soft after being roasted, so we tried putting one in the microwave.  It puffed up in a very cool way.  She ate about 5 puffed marshmellows that day and hasn&#39;t asked for one since.  The bag (3/4 full) of marshmellows is still on the kitchen counter in plain site. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe keep the miniature sized reece&#39;s cups, kitkats, and several other candies on a shelf where Lydia can get them without my help (but locked away from the 1.5 yo who has to ask for them, since he sometimes puts them in his mouth without unwrapping them).   If  Lydia wants a kind of candy she writes it on the grocery list, just like we all do for whatever we want, and it gets purchased the next trip (grocery trips occur 1-2 times a week).  I think that it is the knoweldge of access that helps.  I don&#39;t have to have some of every candy on hand for Lydia not to feel that they are scarce because she knows that if she wants it we will buy it.  <br/>\n  <br/>\n-Cat  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162967824,"authorName":"Dawn Adams","from":"&quot;Dawn Adams&quot; &lt;Wishbone@...&gt;","profile":"bluenosegoddess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Getting fat and cavities","postDate":"1092996531","msgId":98543,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDMwMWM0ODY5ZCRjODMxYTI2MCQ5MDRjZGUxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwOTI5NDAyODAuMTQ5OC45NzQwMy5tMjFAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDEzNjAxYzQ4NjQwJDU0ZmZkZGEwJDY0MDFhOGMwQHJtYndjMT4="},"prevInTopic":98536,"nextInTopic":98546,"prevInTime":98542,"nextInTime":98544,"topicId":98492,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She stays up late a lot but then she just sleeps in.<br/>\n  You&#39;ve assumed that if kids have a choice they&#39;ll always choose wrong. If they have the freedom to practice choice however, they get really good at it. My toddler dragged me into bed at around 9:30 because he wanted to sleep.

My daughter crinkled her nose at the offer of chocolate last night in favour of fruit cocktail. My toddler brought me back his half eaten peanut butter cup because he was no longer hungry (And he used to crave chocolate before I decided to let him have it whenever he wanted it). If it&#39;s a toss up between candy and an apple or carrot sticks and dip usually the carrots or apple wins. If kids have experience eating (and even binging - my son did eat a ton of party mix last night) they know what makes them feel good and what doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s not growing out of junk that&#39;s important, it&#39;s having control over it so that it doesn&#39;t control you. I&#39;m betting you never had control over your own food as I kid. I&#39;m also betting your daughter doesn&#39;t and hasn&#39;t really so you don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll just keep on going or not if she had a chance to get it out of her system. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":182360290,"authorName":"SHYRLEY WILLIAMS","from":"=?iso-8859-1?q?SHYRLEY=20WILLIAMS?= &lt;shyrley.williams@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Getting fat and cavities","postDate":"1092988735","msgId":98536,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwODIwMDc1ODU1LjY4OTEucW1haWxAd2ViODYyMDQubWFpbC51a2wueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxMzYwMWM0ODY0MCQ1NGZmZGRhMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBybWJ3YzE+"},"prevInTopic":98530,"nextInTopic":98543,"prevInTime":98535,"nextInTime":98537,"topicId":98492,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Good teeth brushing and lots of exercise.

Fluoride doesn&#39;t kill it and inhibits the<br/>\nabsorption of Vit D.

But I want to clarify.  My dd doesn&#39;t just *keep on going*, if<br/>\nby that you mean that she eats sweets uncontrollably.  Despite the fact that<br/>\ndd2 eats a lot more sweets than dd1, it still isn&#39;t to excess.  (Dd1 doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmuch care for sweets.)  I was just trying to make the point that different<br/>\npeople with free access to food will choose varying amounts of sweets<br/>\ndepending on their likes and dislikes.  Neither of my kids eats to the point<br/>\nwhere they are uncomfortable.   Dd2 likes sweets and eats them more often<br/>\nthan some people mention about their kids with open access to foods but she<br/>\nalso, over the course of a week, eats a wide variety of foods, including<br/>\nfruits, veggies, and whole grains.  I just have to look at it over the<br/>\ncourse of a week, and not necessarily a day.   (also, I want to mention that<br/>\nwhat I do doesn&#39;t really count because I wasn&#39;t raised with free access and<br/>\nI was forced to clean my plate, so I have issues of my own.)<br/>\n <br/>\nFor the record, Neither of my children with open access to all foods have<br/>\nany cavities at all and both are thin and healthy. <br/>\n <br/>\nI didn&#39;t mean by bringing this up to put a boulder in the path of people who<br/>\nare trying to ease up with food issues.  &lt;please continue to ease up!&gt;  I<br/>\njust wanted them to realize that it may (or may not) look different at their<br/>\nhouse or with each of their children than someone else&#39;s house or children,<br/>\nwith regards to what is eaten and what isn&#39;t.<br/>\n <br/>\nI was trying to say, that despite the fact that we have never controlled<br/>\nfood that one dd likes and eats sweets more often than the other.  Both are<br/>\nthin and healthy and neither have cavities.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI think I am starting to repeat myself.
