So that <br/>\npretty much encompasses everyone on the list. Thanks for all comments <br/>\nwhether I liked them or not. They all helped in some way to encourage my <br/>\nthinking even further or reinforce what I feel already. Sorry if I got a <br/>\nlittle hot headed with anyone, I&#39;ve been dealing on no more than 4 hours of <br/>\nsleep a night and I will use that as an excuse. There were times when my <br/>\nhusband wondered why I bothered posting or was as nice as I was with my <br/>\nwords at times. I knew it was for a good reason.<br/>\nBeen on lists before and I know if you can weather the storm, sunny days are <br/>\nahead.
