I think Tom is one of the most <br/>\nexciting things to come along in this neighborhood for a long time. We moved here <br/>\nalmost 3 years ago and he got many of the pop quizzes you mentioned. However <br/>\nsince then Tom had been the driving force in a number of construction projects <br/>\ncarried on in the neighborhood (mostly our garage), a couple of skateboard <br/>\nramps, several versions of hand gliders (to fly THEM, no success yet) and of <br/>\ncourse the house, oh and several trials at springy shoes made out of an old box <br/>\nspring. I once overheard him ask an overnight guest from his volleyball team &quot;Do <br/>\nyou build?&quot; Hmmmm, doesn&#39;t everybody?
