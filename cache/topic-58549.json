Their assertions about music and art sound good and soothing while <br/>\n  you&#39;re first hearing it, but from the point of view of art or music they seem <br/>\n  like nonsense.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And one of the saddest homeschooling stories I&#39;ve ever heard was of a family <br/>\n  where the parents became suddenly SO sold on Waldorf stuff that they went in <br/>\n  and cleaned out their son&#39;s toys.  Everything with faces and everything <br/>\n  plastic was swept up and trashed.  And they presented him with his new <br/>\n  improved &quot;guaranteed&quot; nurturing and wonderful new toys.  But the little boy&#39;s <br/>\n  favorite thing had been a My Little Pony, and it was thrown away without <br/>\n  consultation.  He had not only no interest in the new faceless wooden pony, <br/>\n  but felt hugely betrayed and hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s another example of parents looking at a &quot;program&quot; instead of at their <br/>\n  own child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58511,"nextTopicId":58550}}
