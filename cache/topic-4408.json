I<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t believe that seeing an occasional act of violence on TV will turn<br/>\n&gt;someone into an ax murderer, but what possible good can come from seeing<br/>\n&gt;hours of TV violence or reading lots of violent stories?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My husband loves &quot;action flicks&quot; and horror movies. Blood, gore,<br/>\ndecapitations -- bring &#39;em on.

I don&#39;t appear to be less violent than he is. Not more<br/>\nso, but not less.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s easy to blame television, but I don&#39;t feel &quot;desensitized&quot; in<br/>\nthe least. I ache on those few occasions I witness real-life violence. So<br/>\ndoes my husband, though it&#39;s fun for him to watch Mel Gibson get beat up by<br/>\nthe bad guys and win the day in the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nReality is reality, fantasy is fantasy, and when the twain meet, I look to<br/>\nthe character and health of the individual, not to the medium whether that&#39;s<br/>\ntelevision, radio, books, fireside songs or racial memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4411,"nextTopicId":4415}}
