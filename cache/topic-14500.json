Why<br/>\nshould you care?  Well, he wanted to mail a letter to every U.S. household<br/>\nwarning of a health risk.  (The last time a Surgeon General did this, it was<br/>\nC. Everett Koop, and the risk was AIDS.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe danger is a liver disease known as Hepatitis C (HCV).  If you received<br/>\nblood for any reason--surgery, a car accident, a cesarean birth--before July<br/>\n1992, when accurate blood-screening began, you could be at risk.  And you<br/>\ncan carry the disease for 30 years before noticing any symptoms.  Hepatitis<br/>\nC can be diagnosed with blood tests, and treatment is effective in up to 40%<br/>\nof cases.  Untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure and liver<br/>\ncancer.  An estimated 4 million Americans are infected, including many<br/>\nveterans, and 70% have no symptoms.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo read Dr. Satcher&#39;s letter and learn more about HCV and other risk<br/>\nfactors, go to www.surgeongeneral.gov/topics/hepatitisc/letter.htm or call<br/>\nthe American Liver Foundation hotline at 1-800-465-4837.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\nIf Ignorance Is Bliss Why Aren&#39;t More People Happy?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14445,"nextTopicId":14495}}
