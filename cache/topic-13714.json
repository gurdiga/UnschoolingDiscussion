His penchant for simple<br/>\nliving; his indifference toward acquiring material things; his lifelong<br/>\ndedication to learning; his blue collar employment; and his non-mainstream<br/>\nphilosophies--all have had a significant impact on my worldview.<br/>\n<br/>\nHoffer&#39;s widely-acclaimed book, &quot;The True Believer&quot; appeared in 1951.<br/>\nEssentially, it is a critique of mass movements.  His message is timeless.<br/>\nHere are a few favorite quotes from that book:<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\n&quot;People in a hurry will imitate more readily than people at leisure.<br/>\nHustling thus tends to produce uniformity.&quot;<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\n&quot;Men of thought seldom work well together, whereas between men of action<br/>\nthere is usually an easy camaraderie.  Teamwork is rare in intellectual or<br/>\nartistic undertakings, but common and almost indispensable among men of<br/>\naction.&quot;<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\n &quot;The creative man of words is ill at ease in the atmosphere of an active<br/>\nmovement.  He feels that its whirl and passion sap his creative energies.<br/>\nSo long as he is conscious of the creative flow within him, he will not find<br/>\nfulfillment in leading millions and in winning victories.  The result is<br/>\nthat, once the movement starts rolling, he either retires voluntarily or is<br/>\npushed aside.  Moreover, since the genuine man of words can never<br/>\nwholeheartedly and for long suppress his critical faculty, he is inevitably<br/>\ncast in the role of the heretic.&quot;<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a short bio on Hoffer&#39;s life:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/6/0,5716,41586+1+40701,00.html?que\">http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/6/0,5716,41586+1+40701,00.html?que</a><br/>\nry=eric%20hoffer<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Andersen<br/>\nUncoventional Ideas at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://unconventional.go.to\">http://unconventional.go.to</a><br/>\nBlue Collar Independent Scholar:  Can You Be a Real Scholar Even When It<br/>\nIsn&#39;t Your Paid Profession?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.themestream.com/gspd_browse/browse/view_article.gsp?c_id=49322\">http://www.themestream.com/gspd_browse/browse/view_article.gsp?c_id=49322</a><br/>\nRead about the Andersen family travels:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spiritone.com/~andersen/travel.html\">http://www.spiritone.com/~andersen/travel.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13706,"nextTopicId":13721}}
