She s basically an introverted","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-528326107\">My daughter is now almost 4 years old and when she was a little toddler<br/>\nshe HATED going to playgroups that weren&#39;t in the park.  She&#39;s basically<br/>\nan introverted personality type (per: Raising Your Spirited Child), but<br/>\nshe&#39;s very, very energetic and has a mind of her own (really, really). She<br/>\nwas not very social, although she seemed to like other kids and adults,<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t like a lot of them around.  So we stopped hanging around with<br/>\nour playgroups (very, very hard on extroverted me) and she was happier.  <br/>\nNow at 4 she loves talking to people and she expresses herself very well.  <br/>\nIf i&#39;m around she&#39;ll talk to almost anyone interesting and almost always<br/>\nto other kids (its very funny to watch her run up to kids she doesn&#39;t know<br/>\nin the park and say, &quot;Hi, my name&#39;s Athena.  What&#39;s your&#39;s?&quot;  -- this from<br/>\na toddler who hated strangers, yelled in terror whenever someone she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know said hi, etc.)  I have two points: one, is that kids get there<br/>\neventually.  Like a lot of people have mentioned, socialization is all in<br/>\ntheir individual growth pattern (like walking, reading, etc.) and two, we,<br/>\nas a culture know very little about how babies and toddlers naturally are.  <br/>\nUntil we have them ourselves, we have no idea what&#39;s within normal range<br/>\nfor the behavior of toddlers.  I was amazed at how hard it was to take<br/>\ncare of a baby and then I nearly fainted when I realized how hard my<br/>\ntoddler was going to be!  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing: take a bath with your toddler, if you can.  It takes care<br/>\nof two things at once (you get clean, she gets clean) and there&#39;s no<br/>\nscreaming (usually!)  I also found water to be very soothing for my little<br/>\nspirited one.  There were days when we took up to 4 baths!<br/>\n<br/>\nWini<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________<br/>\nWINIFRED HAUN & DANCERS<br/>\n4225 N.

And kids grow and change so exceptionally quickly,<br/>\n&gt;bare in mind he could be a totally different child in 6-12 months.  His<br/>\n&gt;lack of interest in others would be apparent even if -as you put it- you<br/>\n&gt;were like every other conforming parent and had him in<br/>\n&gt;preschool/daycare.  Perhaps he is just naturally shy.  That&#39;s his right<br/>\n&gt;and his temperment is his own.  Look how many of us adults struggle in<br/>\n&gt;social situations?  Not all of us are confident regarding large parties,<br/>\n&gt;public speaking, travel, you name it.  Why aren&#39;t our children allowed<br/>\n&gt;the same privelege?  I am constantly annoyed with &quot;bullies&quot; who demand<br/>\n&gt;all children should behave in a prescribed way and if the children<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t, a judgemental finger is always wagging at the parents.<br/>\n&gt;Especially if you&#39;re home/un-schooling.  Aside from normal shyness,<br/>\n&gt;(which almost EVERY child experiences in one form or another; it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;nature&#39;s way of protecting our children from potentially unnerving<br/>\n&gt;situations) let us not forget that this child is still only a toddler,<br/>\n&gt;an infant really in terms of an entire lifespan, and it&#39;s normal for<br/>\n&gt;children to simply lack the maturity at that age to comfortably conduct<br/>\n&gt;themselves around strangers.  Again, he could be a totally different<br/>\n&gt;personality in a year.  He&#39;s just not interested and/or ready yet.<br/>\n&gt;That&#39;s no reflection on you or homeschooling.  If anything it shows he<br/>\n&gt;is firm about his attachment to you and he doesn&#39;t need outsiders to<br/>\n&gt;meet his needs.  In the future, his attachment/security/relationship<br/>\n&gt;with you will only contribute to his &quot;socialization&quot; in a positive way.<br/>\n&gt;Maybe he&#39;s just a very good judge of character and hasn&#39;t met anyone who<br/>\n&gt;measures up yet!  For the first 6 years and beyond every parenting book<br/>\n&gt;worth its salt, recognizes that the mother-child bond is THE most<br/>\n&gt;important relationship to cultivate.  He will get to know the rest of<br/>\n&gt;the world after the security you two have is firmly established. Forget<br/>\n&gt;the so-called &quot;norms&quot; for social development.  Don&#39;t push your child<br/>\n&gt;into stressful situations with strangers, it will only complicate the<br/>\n&gt;issue.  Embrace this time that he is still all your own, because when<br/>\n&gt;things change with him you will miss the fact that you&#39;ve lost your<br/>\n&gt;baby!  I was very shy and somewhat of a loner most of my childhood and<br/>\n&gt;to this day I think I handle social situations much more successfully,<br/>\n&gt;courteously and sensitively than most of my compatriates.  And I now<br/>\n&gt;know literally hundreds of acquaintances through my various volunteer<br/>\n&gt;organizations and interests.  We have to come up with a new definition<br/>\n&gt;of &quot;socialization&quot; because I don&#39;t like what it represents according to<br/>\n&gt;others&#39; definition.  3 kids later, I&#39;m seeing my so-called &quot;sheltered&quot;,<br/>\n&gt;homeschooled children put other neighbourhood and schooled children to<br/>\n&gt;shame with their socialization skills.  And MY children were often the<br/>\n&gt;shy ones at gatherings over the years.  We&#39;ve never even utilized<br/>\n&gt;babysitters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Trust your instincts as a mother and feel confident that you can stand<br/>\n&gt;up to the misguided scrutiny of others.  Some day you will be rewarded<br/>\n&gt;for your courage to be different!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sonia<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Eileen Konieczny wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Eileen Konieczny&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jazballard@...\">jazballard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; OK here goes..

( another good book is the hurried child by<br/>\nelkind)<br/>\n<br/>\nin my opinion  this &#39;fad&#39; of early socialization has an immediate<br/>\nnegative effect of over stimulation and challenges (at best) the<br/>\nparent/child relationship.  i think someone said, in an prior discussion<br/>\nof early socialization on this list,  something to the effect that they<br/>\nstopped having problems once they quitting doing it:)  i honestly<br/>\nbelieve over stimulation at an early age is a problem because kids need<br/>\nquiet and time for self-discovery and don&#39;t need all the noisy and<br/>\ndemands for conformity from the outside world interfering with this.<br/>\n<br/>\nwe take rene&#39; to park days once a week and started this at the age of<br/>\n4.  prior to this we ran errands and went to the park when we felt like<br/>\nit (a kind of consensus).  we didn&#39;t force anything, just got to know<br/>\neach other and messed around at home - lived the quiet life.  people<br/>\nmade comments and openly expressed their doubts but we just did what<br/>\ncame natural.  we were not and are impervious to the doubts of others<br/>\nbut we make a conscious and concerted effort to recognize it&#39;s<br/>\ndisparaging effects and &#39;stop them in their tracts&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy overall advise would be - relax and be yourself and don&#39;t hurry it<br/>\nalong.<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin, tx<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A.

I am writing to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-76979197\">Hi Eileen!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am TOTALLY new at this cyber communication gig, having just signed-up<br/>\nlast night, so here is my first attempt at soap-boxing!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am writing to tell you your 3 year old child sounds TOTALLY normal. <br/>\nThere could be several explanations for his lack of interest in other<br/>\nchildren just now.  And kids grow and change so exceptionally quickly,<br/>\nbare in mind he could be a totally different child in 6-12 months.  His<br/>\nlack of interest in others would be apparent even if -as you put it- you<br/>\nwere like every other conforming parent and had him in<br/>\npreschool/daycare.  Perhaps he is just naturally shy.  That&#39;s his right<br/>\nand his temperment is his own.  Look how many of us adults struggle in<br/>\nsocial situations?  Not all of us are confident regarding large parties,<br/>\npublic speaking, travel, you name it.  Why aren&#39;t our children allowed<br/>\nthe same privelege?  I am constantly annoyed with &quot;bullies&quot; who demand<br/>\nall children should behave in a prescribed way and if the children<br/>\ndon&#39;t, a judgemental finger is always wagging at the parents. <br/>\nEspecially if you&#39;re home/un-schooling.  Aside from normal shyness,<br/>\n(which almost EVERY child experiences in one form or another; it&#39;s<br/>\nnature&#39;s way of protecting our children from potentially unnerving<br/>\nsituations) let us not forget that this child is still only a toddler,<br/>\nan infant really in terms of an entire lifespan, and it&#39;s normal for<br/>\nchildren to simply lack the maturity at that age to comfortably conduct<br/>\nthemselves around strangers.  Again, he could be a totally different<br/>\npersonality in a year.  He&#39;s just not interested and/or ready yet. <br/>\nThat&#39;s no reflection on you or homeschooling.  If anything it shows he<br/>\nis firm about his attachment to you and he doesn&#39;t need outsiders to<br/>\nmeet his needs.  In the future, his attachment/security/relationship<br/>\nwith you will only contribute to his &quot;socialization&quot; in a positive way.<br/>\nMaybe he&#39;s just a very good judge of character and hasn&#39;t met anyone who<br/>\nmeasures up yet!  For the first 6 years and beyond every parenting book<br/>\nworth its salt, recognizes that the mother-child bond is THE most<br/>\nimportant relationship to cultivate.  He will get to know the rest of<br/>\nthe world after the security you two have is firmly established. Forget<br/>\nthe so-called &quot;norms&quot; for social development.  Don&#39;t push your child<br/>\ninto stressful situations with strangers, it will only complicate the<br/>\nissue.  Embrace this time that he is still all your own, because when<br/>\nthings change with him you will miss the fact that you&#39;ve lost your<br/>\nbaby!  I was very shy and somewhat of a loner most of my childhood and<br/>\nto this day I think I handle social situations much more successfully,<br/>\ncourteously and sensitively than most of my compatriates.  And I now<br/>\nknow literally hundreds of acquaintances through my various volunteer<br/>\norganizations and interests.  We have to come up with a new definition<br/>\nof &quot;socialization&quot; because I don&#39;t like what it represents according to<br/>\nothers&#39; definition.  3 kids later, I&#39;m seeing my so-called &quot;sheltered&quot;,<br/>\nhomeschooled children put other neighbourhood and schooled children to<br/>\nshame with their socialization skills.  And MY children were often the<br/>\nshy ones at gatherings over the years.  We&#39;ve never even utilized<br/>\nbabysitters. <br/>\n<br/>\nTrust your instincts as a mother and feel confident that you can stand<br/>\nup to the misguided scrutiny of others.  Some day you will be rewarded<br/>\nfor your courage to be different!<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nEileen Konieczny wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Eileen Konieczny&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jazballard@...\">jazballard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OK here goes..

Not only are toddlers/preschoolers not very good at being social with each other because they are all in the same primitive stage of egocentrism combined with lack of social skills, but they don&#39;t really care to either.  They are not at a very social age for peers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys are three years old, and two years old next week, respectively.  We stopped attending our weekly playgroup for a variety of reasons, not the least of which were negative social repercussions for them.  We do not take any classes or attend any groups, they do not have sitters, and they do not attend day care.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile they do have the benefit of having each other to play with (they are mostly inseperable) we are taking steps to seperate them more and give them more alone time.  This arose as a problem due to my elder son&#39;s hyperactive and overbearing personality, coupled with his brother&#39;s quiet and shy demeanor.  We feel that our younger son is not being given the time or opportunity to develop his own interests and personality due to being always overridden by his brother.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we have arranged two weekly &quot;Daddy Days&quot;  where each of the boys gets to go out for alone time with their father to do something special once a week (Thomas on Tue. night and Alex on Thur. night) while the other has the opportunity to stay home and do something alone with me, or do their own thing, without his brother.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, they are learning about personal boundaries, manners and empathy all in the safety and forgiving environment of their relationships at home.  They see other children at the playground and are quite open and social with them, they interact well with quests who come to our house or people whose homes we visit, and they talk to strangers in stores, etc.  I feel that it is vitally important to let them develop the confidence and competence in their social skills first in the safety of home with us, and them slowly reach out farther and farther with them as they are ready.  I don&#39;t believe in forcing them to be social or into &quot;enrichment&quot; situations.  I do believe in giving them access to opportunities to be social with peers as they show the readiness and desire to do that.  So far, they could not really care less about it if they tried.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/mail.html\">http://www.idahopagan.com/mail.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Brown","from":"Brown &lt;mjcmbrwn@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"7V_3w6yqaNlE_p7P-k90t3-ObBxhtsQRHm79Ib1EPuxt1yfTLOfY72Y66YU00EfrTNRIxLFD4jIvaR4BITWGE7vT","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"socialization- the little ones","postDate":"951791766","msgId":6824,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40MzYuNjgyNC45NTkyNjk3NDdAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6822,"nextInTopic":6825,"prevInTime":6823,"nextInTime":6825,"topicId":6821,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Eileen I have 4 sons (18, 16, 12, 9).

Honest. The thing is, we focus<br/>\non our own kids so much. When we look around at all the others, we see them<br/>\ndoing what we&#39;d like ours to be doing. But we only look for a few minutes.<br/>\nIn Playcentre, which is a parent run preschool system here in New Zealand,<br/>\nparents are asked to participate in parent education. One of the things we<br/>\nhad to do, was observe a child - *not* our own. We had to write down<br/>\neverything that child did and said, and who to, what they said etc.<br/>\nSometimes it was just for 10 minutes, but sometimes it was for a whole<br/>\nmorning. It was a great thing to do - it helped me realise that other kids<br/>\nweren&#39;t the perfect little darlings I, in my role as anxious mother, assumed<br/>\nthem to be. So next time you go to gym, try watching someone else&#39;s kid for<br/>\na while - not the little star (there&#39;s always one of those) but just one or<br/>\ntwo of the other ordinary little kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes think that the fear of my children being social misfits has been<br/>\nthe biggest fear I had. Having 4 boys at the ages they are now, I&#39;ve stopped<br/>\nworrying. I have 2 extroverts, 2 introverts, but they are all just fine in<br/>\ntheir individual ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry not to worry - it will be okay.
