If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they asked for it I would give it to them but I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make an issue after they were used to using the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; toilet. When I ran out of candy I just told them that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was out and the next time I went to the store I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would get some more. They continued to use the toilet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I always gave a verbal praise and made a big deal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of it verbally, but they forgot about the candy by the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time I got to the store and never asked for it again.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When I am trying to get them to pick up and they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; want to I will make a treat and tell them that they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can have it when they are done and praise them all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; way while they are cleaning.

He&#39;s unable to tolerate sitting still for very<br/>\n&gt; long.  Over the last year of schooling, the lessons he remembers best are<br/>\n&gt; the ones in which we just talked-he asked tons of questions and I answered<br/>\n&gt; them, or, if I couldn&#39;t, we looked it up together. Usually while we talked,<br/>\n&gt; he ran circles around the house, careened across the kitchen floor on our<br/>\n&gt; wheeled desk chair, or rolled on the carpet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to know from people who began as homeschoolers and &quot;morphed&quot; into<br/>\n&gt; unschoolers: what was the toughest thing about changing?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m ending my second year of homeschooling, and Seamus (7yob) has let me<br/>\n&gt; know in no uncertain terms :-) he prefers unschooling.  He is an extremely<br/>\n&gt; high energy child and reenergizes by interacting with others. Questions non<br/>\n&gt; stop, always bouncing around and moving. Sit still and &quot;do homework&quot;!?<br/>\n&gt; Nearly impossible, and quickly becoming unthinkable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a hard time keeping up with his energy levels. Regular homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; is easier for me-but Seamus rarely gets fully engaged with this sort of<br/>\n&gt; learning, so I&#39;ve been changing to meet his needs. It&#39;s tiring, but the<br/>\n&gt; desire in me is there.  I&#39;m motivated to change every time I see him get<br/>\n&gt; engaged in a sloppy unstructured &quot;lesson&quot;.  It&#39;s like a moment of zen, or an<br/>\n&gt; epiphany, or the first time I ever ate Butter Toffee ice cream (mmm mmm mmm<br/>\n&gt; good!).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So for me, the hardest thing to overcome during my transition from<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling to unschooling is constant drain on my energy level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What was the hardest thing for you-or was it a snap?  And do you have any<br/>\n&gt; suggestions for me to get reenergized? (It doesn&#39;t help that my son is an<br/>\n&gt; extrovert and I&#39;m an introvert.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lee<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 10<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 20 Jul 2000 01:05:37 +0100<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tracy.oldfield@...\">tracy.oldfield@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: fed-up...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; no, but i&#39;ll tell them, just like i tell them about when heather got in<br/>\n&gt; with the donkeys at the show-farm we visit...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tracy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 19 Jul 2000, at 8:43, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jaam1224@...\">Jaam1224@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tracy, \u000f<br/>\n&gt; Tooo cute!\u000e How clever your little ones are!\u000e I hope<br/>\n&gt; you wrote this down in \u000f<br/>\n&gt; their baby books to remember when they have kids of<br/>\n&gt; their own.\u000f<br/>\n&gt; Julie\u000f<br/>\n&gt; \u000f<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 11<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 20 Jul 2000 01:05:37 +0100<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tracy.oldfield@...\">tracy.oldfield@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: fed-up...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Julie, is she an only?  i sometimes think it&#39;s tons easier to<br/>\n&gt; organise to do this kind of thing with an only.

I<br/>\n&gt; only used that for potty training, but I bake and<br/>\n&gt; While the kids are tidying up I will put something in<br/>\n&gt; the oven and tell them that if they are finished<br/>\n&gt; before the treat is then they can have the treat. This<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t something I use all the time. Depends on the<br/>\n&gt; situation. Also, sometimes instead of a treat I will<br/>\n&gt; tell them they can&#39;t go play until they are finished.<br/>\n&gt; This works just as well.  Other times they don&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; either just knowing that they helped mommy clean up<br/>\n&gt; and then they are off to do what they want. It just<br/>\n&gt; depends on the situation and everyones mood. Corallyn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get Yahoo!

I&#39;m figuring out that<br/>\n&gt; &quot;IT&quot; doesn&#39;t all have to be learned in 8 years or 12 years or 20 years.<br/>\n&gt; Whatever we don&#39;t cover while my children are in my care, they will learn on<br/>\n&gt; their own in years to come.  I&#39;m still learning about the world around me and<br/>\n&gt; have every reason to expect they will do the same.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You said it yourself...the lessons your son remembers best involve his asking<br/>\n&gt; lots of questions and getting lots of answers.  If you didn&#39;t know the<br/>\n&gt; answer, you looked for them together.  Sounds perfect.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only basics I want to make certain we cover are reading and math.<br/>\n&gt; Especially the reading.  If he has the ability and desire to read, he can<br/>\n&gt; find a resource and learn about anything that interests him.  I figure if he<br/>\n&gt; has a good foundation in these two areas, he can find out anything else he<br/>\n&gt; needs to learn when he needs it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Math also stimulates music, logic, science, art and general thought processes<br/>\n&gt; in addition to helping him figure out taxes, change at the store, or whatever<br/>\n&gt; other math/numbers solutions he&#39;ll need in life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as I&#39;m concerned, even more important than these &#39;disciplines&#39; are the<br/>\n&gt; abilities to be compassionate, polite and considerate to other people while<br/>\n&gt; being true to his own ideals.  My job is to help him find those ideals and<br/>\n&gt; learn to put them into honest practice in his own life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The longer I practice at unschooling, the more excited I become about the<br/>\n&gt; process!  It truly amazes me the things we discuss and learn when &#39;nothing&#39;<br/>\n&gt; is going on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW, my unschooling experiences started with a stubborn teenager who refused<br/>\n&gt; to cooperate with any formal schooling...at home or in a ps setting.  At that<br/>\n&gt; point I figured my choices were to protect our relationship and wait for him<br/>\n&gt; to become &#39;human&#39; again, while giving him opportunities to read, read, read<br/>\n&gt; and explore areas that interested him, or I could beat the living daylights<br/>\n&gt; out of him and &#39;force him to learn&#39;.  Let&#39;s just say it quickly became<br/>\n&gt; obvious that &#39;forced learning&#39; was going to get us no where!  (and, just for<br/>\n&gt; the record, I never did get around to the beatings!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That started when he would have been in 9th grade (we removed him from ps<br/>\n&gt; mid-8th grade because he had figured out how to be lazy and use the<br/>\n&gt; system...wait until mom got a failing notice at mid-term, turn in all<br/>\n&gt; homework, getting straight &#39;A&#39;s on everything for 3 weeks and never turn in<br/>\n&gt; any work again  would get him a &#39;C&#39; grade.  He was satisfied with that.  It<br/>\n&gt; meant he didn&#39;t have to repeat the class and that&#39;s all he cared about.  He<br/>\n&gt; saw no reason to prove to the teacher that he knew the material nor any<br/>\n&gt; reason to wait around for the rest of the class to catch up to information he<br/>\n&gt; had down already.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I did not want to encourage a beat-the-system attitude, so we withdrew him<br/>\n&gt; from school.  Well, that coupled with the fact that the school district and I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t see eye to eye on appropriate reasons for him to miss school...ie his<br/>\n&gt; father worked out of town all week, home every other weekend and I wanted to<br/>\n&gt; take the children to visit for a 3 day weekend.  The school disapproved and<br/>\n&gt; refused to &#39;allow&#39; the absence which meant automatic failing marks on any<br/>\n&gt; missed work and no opportunity to make it up or do it in advance.  I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think it&#39;s the school principal&#39;s place to decide my family&#39;s lifestyle or<br/>\n&gt; what the needs of my children are.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, for several years, he read, asked questions and explored the world while<br/>\n&gt; I felt I was neglecting his education but could find no way to convince him<br/>\n&gt; that studying would be a good idea.  We tried to enroll him in the local<br/>\n&gt; community college at age 16...he was excited and ready.  But, the cc insisted<br/>\n&gt; we had to have a letter from the school district stating that he was released<br/>\n&gt; from their education jurisdiction.  The school district refused to do any<br/>\n&gt; such thing since he had never been under their umbrella.  So, we waited until<br/>\n&gt; he was 18 and he enrolled in community classes, passing all the required<br/>\n&gt; entrance/placement exams with no problems.  He took a couple of classes, just<br/>\n&gt; for the heck of it, but still had some authority issues to work out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Eventually, (age 19) he decided it was time to get married and he wanted to<br/>\n&gt; be an electrician&#39;s apprentice.  That meant he had to get a GED.  Other than<br/>\n&gt; the college classes where he would not crack a book, but would listen to the<br/>\n&gt; lectures, he had done no formal training for several years...5, or so, I<br/>\n&gt; think.  I strongly suggested he study before taking the GED test so he would<br/>\n&gt; be prepared.  Again, he was not interested.  The end result...the stinker<br/>\n&gt; passed with flying colors the first try with no advance preparation!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That started me feeling a little more confident that unschooling would work.<br/>\n&gt; so, with our second child (10 years younger), I&#39;ve been much more relaxed and<br/>\n&gt; he finds his way to subjects when he&#39;s ready or has a need.  Some areas it<br/>\n&gt; would seem he is &#39;behind&#39; peers his age.  For instance, today was the first<br/>\n&gt; day he felt confident to declare he was going to go ride his 2 wheel bike on<br/>\n&gt; his own...he&#39;s 11 1/2.  Works for me.  He decided he was ready and set about<br/>\n&gt; the struggle to get the job done.  Not at all coordinated about it yet, but<br/>\n&gt; very pleased with himself.  I strongly suspect he&#39;ll be using his bike quite<br/>\n&gt; a bit in the next few weeks and who knows what will happen from there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; OTOH he has an inate ability to figure out math, science and logic without my<br/>\n&gt; presenting the information to him in a formal way.  Out of the blue he will<br/>\n&gt; tell me he has figured out such and so...After listening to some of his<br/>\n&gt; theories and what led to his conclusions, I may give him the formal name of<br/>\n&gt; what it is he&#39;s telling me and we talk about it, learning as we go.  It is<br/>\n&gt; usually on the algebra, geography, physics or science level.  Sometimes he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; on the right track, sometimes not.  But by listening to his theories first,<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s ready to listen to what I have to say.  When I point out that we are<br/>\n&gt; discussing subjects that I didn&#39;t learn about until college, he feels quite<br/>\n&gt; pleased with himself.  It is very stimulating to both of us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another big factor to our using an unschooling approach (and another reason<br/>\n&gt; for us to avoid ps) is my health.  I have a rather dibilating case of<br/>\n&gt; fibromyalgia.  Many days are pretty bad.  It&#39;s not like I need him to take<br/>\n&gt; care of me, but if I had to stick to a ps schedule and their requirements, it<br/>\n&gt; would be very bad on my health.  I simply do not know from day to day how I<br/>\n&gt; will be feeling.  It is VERY difficult for me to make a commitment to an<br/>\n&gt; appointment and be confident I can keep it.  Takes days of advance planning<br/>\n&gt; and reserving my energy when I know I have something coming up that I MUST<br/>\n&gt; do.  So, on good days we do things together, on poor days I help him<br/>\n&gt; self-direct his energies.  We couldn&#39;t do that with a ps experience.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s a bit of my experiences.  Hope it helps a little.  As I see it each<br/>\n&gt; family has a different path and different things work for them.   There are<br/>\n&gt; lots of inspiring stories of families out and about doing things every day or<br/>\n&gt; several times a week, learning as they go.  I&#39;m jealous of the $$, time and<br/>\n&gt; energy they have to be able to do that.  But, no sense dwelling on what<br/>\n&gt; someone else is doing.  This is working very well for us.  The hard part can<br/>\n&gt; be trying to explain it to others who are really wary or concerned that I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; neglecting his education.  Especially my SIL who is a city cop AND on the<br/>\n&gt; school board.  Basically I simply tell them we evaluate him on a regular<br/>\n&gt; basis and he is making satisfactory/excellent progress.  That sort of phrase<br/>\n&gt; seems to be enough of a techno-phrase to satisfy most people.  (except my<br/>\n&gt; mother, but that&#39;s another story!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He always has a thick book in his hand and his nose in it; doesn&#39;t sit still<br/>\n&gt; and do nothing for any length of time at all.  He may be watching TV or<br/>\n&gt; playing &#39;tendo or &#39;playing&#39; &#39;puter games, or jumping ont he trampoline or<br/>\n&gt; wrestling with his dad or cousins, but then there is lots of discussion about<br/>\n&gt; what has happened.  (he&#39;s very verbal!)  Which leads to more discussion.<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s learning to train the dogs, which leads to learning about pack behavior<br/>\n&gt; and other animal charactistics which leads to environmental awareness,<br/>\n&gt; ecogoly, weather patterns/systems, astronomy, you name it.  It&#39;s a cycle we<br/>\n&gt; simply cannot avoid.  Good thing, I suppose...BG<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One thing I try to do is keep up with what he is reading.  He reads on a<br/>\n&gt; college level, which sometimes leaves him interested in books I don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s quite ready for.  OTOH sometimes he is reading adult level books I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; comprehend and he understands profoundly!  LOL  I learn along the way and it<br/>\n&gt; helps me stay in touch with his interests as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FWIW,<br/>\n&gt; Eiraul<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 16<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 19 Jul 2000 01:29:50 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: Sonia Ulan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sulan@...\">sulan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re: Croup<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your response Amy!

They are unrelated though both can stop breathing if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they get bad enough. All of my kids have had croup at one time or another<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and most have been easily treated with the steam in the bathroom routine.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I have had one child rushed to ER when he started to turn blue.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Usually croup is harmless (sounds a lot worse than it is) and will pass in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; few days but it still warrants watching, just in case.  Wheezing and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coughing gunk up, on the other hand, is lung related and requires a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different treatment (whether medical or homeopathy) than croup.  The good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thing is that steam in the bathroom is good for croup and for gunk in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lungs so if you&#39;re not sure which it is, it will help regardless.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; April<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Visit www.ibelieve.com  today and get a FREE book by Chuck Swindoll!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/963839217/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/963839217/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit www.ibelieve.com  today and get a FREE book by Chuck Swindoll!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/964016903/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/964016903/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 21<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 19 Jul 2000 01:56:54 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: Sonia Ulan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sulan@...\">sulan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Fw: help please!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the Refrigerator/Freezer trick, Karen!

My dh came down<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a cold, and they all caught it.  My oldest had it the worst.  He was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; barking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like a seal!  We took the kids to the ped. to make sure they did not have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something else.  He told me that if any of them had real difficulty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, then take them to the ER.  Otherwise, keep using the steam, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; freezer  (from the refrigerator) to help treat it.  If it did not improve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a few days he would have considered using a steroid to help keep airways<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; opened, but after about 3 days it improved considerably.  He did recommend<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; using a cough med that had &quot;DM&quot; in its name , and also warm, soothing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; drinks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for the irritated throat.  My kids liked warm carob and milk.  Hope your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little one feels better soon.  ~Karen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Visit www.ibelieve.com  today and get a FREE book by Chuck Swindoll!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/963855559/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/963855559/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit www.ibelieve.com  today and get a FREE book by Chuck Swindoll!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/964016941/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/964016941/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 22<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 19 Jul 2000 02:00:16 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: Sonia Ulan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sulan@...\">sulan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Fw: help please!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Amy,  I need clarification...You say your kids only take asthma meds<br/>\n&gt; during colds?

My 22 month old has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; croup again.  My other two children never had it and in my family I grew<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up in none of us ever had it, so I&#39;m not overly sure how to treat it.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know about the steam and taking the child out into the cold air trick<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but this is summer so what do I do?  Also, when he&#39;s had it before (this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might be his 4th episode), it&#39;s always happened at night and by day he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fine.  This time it started at 8 this morning and is continuing through<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the day...is it going to get worse tonight yet?  He seems basically<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fine, is not breathing with great difficulty, just wheezing alot.  We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all do have bad colds right now so it&#39;s extra tough for him breathing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when he&#39;s so congested.  Any advice, information or tips please?  I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appreciate anything anyone has to offer.  A friend in the past told me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to try homeopathy and I did try a couple of doses this a.m. and it did<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not seem to help at all.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sonia<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;

to unschooling<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Eiraul, I knew I liked you! Now I know why-your story sounds so much like<br/>\n&gt; mine!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My oldest boy was much the same-in the 5th grade at ps, my first parent<br/>\n&gt; teacher conference had 2 teachers and the principal present to confront me<br/>\n&gt; about how Rick was getting no score lower than a 95 from tests and classroom<br/>\n&gt; work, but when they averaged in the homework that never seemed to make it to<br/>\n&gt; class (although I was wasting all of our evenings making him do it) he was<br/>\n&gt; getting D&#39;s. One teacher actually cried and said &quot;I&#39;m just afraid he&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; getting the practice he needs&quot;. Excuse me, but if you can get a 98 without<br/>\n&gt; homework, why do you need it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Public school took up our entire lives, it seemed. If they weren&#39;t at<br/>\n&gt; school, then they were doing homework or getting ready for school. Not to<br/>\n&gt; mention all the times I had to race 20 miles to town to get something that<br/>\n&gt; they just had to have for school tomorrow. Absentee policy was also a<br/>\n&gt; problem for me, as the school and I disagreed on the importance of just<br/>\n&gt; taking a day off to have some quality time alone with your mom. Now, where I<br/>\n&gt; live, parents are even being taken to court and fined for school<br/>\n&gt; absences-its a good thing we got out when we did!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your younger son sounds alot like mine-I call him an unschoolers dream<br/>\n&gt; child! He only went to ps for k and 1st grade, not enough to rob him of his<br/>\n&gt; innate capacity to learn naturally-just because he wants to know. He also<br/>\n&gt; was late to ride a bike! He reads alot, has fun with numbers, remembers how<br/>\n&gt; to spell words easily, and is happy and free to be himself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I still worry that they are not doing enough actual school work sometimes,<br/>\n&gt; that they will never learn to write, as it is something that the boys never<br/>\n&gt; seem to want to do. I still hold out hope that when they get a bit older and<br/>\n&gt; want to meet more kids on the net they will need to communicate in writing<br/>\n&gt; and will then learn it-as everything else, when they decide they need to<br/>\n&gt; know, they will learn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We do quite a bit of running around, there are alot of hsers in our area,<br/>\n&gt; and many opportunities for classes and group activities. I also work 4 days<br/>\n&gt; a week, so although I certainly do not envy your illness, I would like more<br/>\n&gt; time to just talk as it seems to be our best learning time also. The years<br/>\n&gt; when they were little and I stayed home were so full of joy for us all. Then<br/>\n&gt; we may have only gone to town once a week-now it seems I am driving all the<br/>\n&gt; time. I am trying to wean us all off of the constant running so that I can<br/>\n&gt; drop at least one more day of work. But as soon as I think that, I get an<br/>\n&gt; email about gym day and think, Oh, wouldn&#39;t that be fun! (I am still trying<br/>\n&gt; to decide on that one)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I love hearing about your oldest son. It is so reassuring to know that it<br/>\n&gt; pays off and I think about these kids often when I have my doubtful days.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cathie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11423,"nextTopicId":11345}}
