The flood<br/>\nin 1993 was mind-boggling.  To see the exact spot<br/>\nwhere I stood for Hands Across America under 12 feet<br/>\nof water was a real shock to the system.  There was a<br/>\ntwo-story building with water almost to the roof.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have words to describe it.  These were places I<br/>\npassed often.  Suddenly, it wasn&#39;t farmland and small<br/>\ntowns.  It was a liquid moonscape.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven after the main floodwater receded, there was at<br/>\nleast six inches on the highway in many places and<br/>\nwater lapping at the edges of the raised roadbeds<br/>\nwhere a shoulder might have been at one time.  The<br/>\nlevees that crammed a six-mile wide river into a<br/>\nmile-wide channel only served to keep the water from<br/>\nfinding its way back to the riverbed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI probably don&#39;t know enough about all that the ACofE<br/>\nhas done but their record doesn&#39;t appear to be good<br/>\nwhen it comes to working with nature.  Their modus<br/>\noperandi seems to be &#39;force it&#39; - which seems like a<br/>\nlosing proposition when the &quot;opponent&quot; has been<br/>\noperating this planet for a few million years.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s Good 2 B Dog Nutz!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.good2bdognutz.com\">http://www.good2bdognutz.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDiscover Yahoo! <br/>\nHave fun online with music videos, cool games, IM and more.

There&#39;s certainly been an outpouring recently of thick but readable books about the Founding Fathers, and Lewis and Clark and the Roosevelts.

I totally agree that we need to eradicate the<br/>\nguilt we may feel for not living up to some false societal standard of<br/>\nwomanhood. BUT there are very relevent contemporary reasons to develop<br/>\nhomemaking type skills, going way back even before the 50s (try the 1850s) -<br/>\ngrowing and preserving our own food, saving rainwater, making clothes,<br/>\nfixing machines, home remedies...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think our whole economy is heading way down in the near future due to the<br/>\nend of cheap oil, global warming, endless war bankrupting the system etc.<br/>\nAmong other things, there will probably be a massive re-localizing of<br/>\nresources because peaches from Chile and sneakers from Indonesia are going<br/>\nto be too expensive to ship here. Our own homeschooling includes a lot of<br/>\nskill building in homemaking/homesteading type skills. Or let me rephrase<br/>\nthat by saying, I feel the need to learn this stuff and my family sometimes<br/>\njoins me. We&#39;ve done wild food gathering, pickling, alternative building<br/>\ntechniques like cob and super adobe, rainwater collection, wool spinning...<br/>\n<br/>\nForget about adding one egg or not to the mix, can you feed your family if<br/>\nthe Vons shelves are empty?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I may sound like a survivalist, I&#39;m not, in the militerized-super<br/>\npatriot-crazy kind of way.
