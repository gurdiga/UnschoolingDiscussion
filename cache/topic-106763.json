Not<br/>\nthat fading memory will shorten my reply ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis teacher was one that my mother&#39;s best friend used<br/>\nwhich translated into &#39;the best piano teacher in the<br/>\nworld.&#39;  Her methods amounted to &#39;if it&#39;s not on the<br/>\npage, you don&#39;t play it.&#39;  Every crescendo had to<br/>\nmatch the marking on the page, for example.  She kept<br/>\na sort of scoresheet, assigned writing tasks (yes, I<br/>\nwrote whole pages of G clefs), etc.  She had a pointer<br/>\nthat she&#39;d use to beat time on the page or poke my<br/>\nhands or wrists.  Which caused me to make mistakes. <br/>\nWhich she marked down in her book and wrote my &#39;score&#39;<br/>\non the page of whatever I was playing.  She made me<br/>\nplay the same piece over and over and over, week after<br/>\nweek, until I scored &#39;100&#39; (as in played it EXACTLY as<br/>\nit was written on the page).<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this was reported to my parents (this is the<br/>\nextra beating I mentioned).  My &#39;reward&#39; for getting<br/>\n100 was that I got to start on yet another piece of<br/>\nher choosing.  And then there was the ever-so-horrid<br/>\nannual piano recital.  You don&#39;t want to know about<br/>\nthat.  Suffice to say that I have tremendous<br/>\nperformance anxiety.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, you see, her requirements were VERY concrete.  And<br/>\nwere, for me, almost completely unattainable.  She was<br/>\nconstructing musical mechanics, not musicians.  In my<br/>\ncase, she immobilized and destroyed the musician.  So<br/>\nI married one :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, I know you could not possibly be teaching<br/>\nby her methods.  I can only think of a few situations<br/>\nwhere I&#39;d expect to find anyone who followed her<br/>\n&#39;techniques.&#39;  However, in my later learning and<br/>\nteaching experiences, I found that my students each<br/>\nrequired and desired something different from their<br/>\nmusic experience.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI spent time trying to find that out.  Most of them<br/>\nwere absolutely shocked that I asked, &quot;Why do you do<br/>\nthis?  What do you like about it?  How can I help<br/>\nyou?&quot;  The ones who did it because &#39;Mom/Dad said so&#39;<br/>\nneeded more help from me to find something THEY could<br/>\nlike about it, even if they never got &#39;better&#39; at it. <br/>\nMy students ranged from age 6 to (I&#39;m not kidding) 68.<br/>\n We had up days and down days and days when we didn&#39;t<br/>\nget where we thought we were going but ended up<br/>\nsomeplace else that was pretty cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it was always about music and everything was good<br/>\nwhen it stayed that way.  If a student told me, &quot;I&#39;d<br/>\ntry more if you gave me (insert your favorite<br/>\ntreat/prize/cash award here),&quot; I would say, &quot;I see,&quot;<br/>\nand then have a conversation with their parents about<br/>\nmaybe finding something else their child wanted to do<br/>\nmore.  Maybe it was a different instrument or maybe it<br/>\nwas a different activity altogether.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI always tried to make sure they knew it was because I<br/>\ncared about their child&#39;s experience.  If we combine<br/>\nforces to make your kid hate music today, what happens<br/>\nin five, ten or fifty years (see my aforementioned 68<br/>\nyear-old student)?  It&#39;s a missed opportunity and<br/>\nsomething that may end up on the &#39;I wish I could&#39; or<br/>\n&#39;Why didn&#39;t I&#39; lists that we all seem to have.  Some<br/>\nkids dig music, some don&#39;t.  It&#39;s all around us so I<br/>\nalways spent a lot of time talking about what we hear,<br/>\nwhat it means to us, what we like about it, what we<br/>\ncan do ourselves.  For me, technical skill was easiest<br/>\nto grow in my students when I spent time tending to<br/>\nthe root desire.  (or this could be a load of<br/>\nfertilizer, if I extend the metaphor)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow aren&#39;t you sorry you asked? :D<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s Good 2 B Dog Nutz!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.good2bdognutz.com\">http://www.good2bdognutz.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

She was so <br/>\nexcited about it afterward in the car that I mentioned to her that the <br/>\nbookstores are doing similar summer reading contests where after you <br/>\nread so many books, you can actually get a free book.  We had to go and <br/>\nsign up RIGHT THEN.  She was so excited at the idea of free books.  She <br/>\nhas made this a goal of hers now for the past week.  She was reading <br/>\njust as much before last week, but now she has a personal goal to <br/>\naccomplish, too.  It would have been very wrong of me to tell her that <br/>\nshe couldn&#39;t participate in these programs when she wanted to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt reminds me of Girl Scout cookie selling time.

I&#39;m thinking of implementing something new this <br/>\n&gt; fall, and while it appeals to me, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s at odds with <br/>\n&gt; what I think about learning and rewards.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I was thinking of having a spreadsheet for each piano <br/>\n&gt; student with a little points sheet. At each lesson, they would get, <br/>\n&gt; say, a point for remembering to bring all their books, a point for <br/>\n&gt; completing any written assignments given, etc. [I would not give <br/>\n&gt; them points for how much/long/often they practiced, for various <br/>\n&gt; reasons.]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They could them get extra points at any time, if they wanted, for <br/>\n&gt; things like memorizing a piece, playing an informal &quot;concert&quot; for <br/>\n&gt; family or friends, etc. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then, I would buy various little candies, keychains, various dollar <br/>\n&gt; store toys, and maybe once a month have &quot;open store&quot; when they could <br/>\n&gt; purchase various things with their points earned. Maybe have the <br/>\n&gt; option, especially for older kids, that they could save a lot of <br/>\n&gt; their points and &quot;buy&quot; a Target gift card or something.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The reason this appeals to me is that I could picture my students <br/>\n&gt; liking it: I&#39;m hoping it would give a more &quot;fun&quot; and special feel to <br/>\n&gt; the whole studio and coming over for lessons. I also could see some <br/>\n&gt; of the kids liking a tangible way of keeping track of their <br/>\n&gt; progress, and taking advantage of doing some of the extra things, <br/>\n&gt; like memorizing pieces.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But I am hesitant ... I remember reading a book called &quot;Punished by <br/>\n&gt; Rewards.&quot; Would something like this ruin natural learning or <br/>\n&gt; enthusiasm? Do you think your own kids would like or benefit from <br/>\n&gt; something like that?

Clementi and Bach were fun.  It  would&#39;ve been <br/>\nnice to have had a teacher who could&#39;ve looked at that and said,  &quot;Okay, <br/>\nyou&#39;d like Telemann, then&quot; but I was dragged through the same Thompson  books as <br/>\neveryone else, regardless of my interests or theirs.  I despised  playing the <br/>\nlate 19th century stuff, the schmlatzy old parlor music.  But  had she told me <br/>\nthat that&#39;s EXACTLY why most people in the 19th century learned  piano, <br/>\nbecause they didn&#39;t have the means to listen to recorded music at home  yet (but <br/>\nwould soon), and so it was a great thing to have music at home, and  especially <br/>\nmusic people could sing along to... THAT would&#39;ve made it come to  life.  But <br/>\nshe didn&#39;t tell me, probably because she didn&#39;t know or care,  because what SHE <br/>\nliked was Rachmaninoff and Chopin, both of which gagged me then  and gag me <br/>\nnow.  Perhaps they&#39;re the olympic sports of the keyboard, but  it&#39;s not any fun <br/>\nto listen to and you sure&#39;s hell can&#39;t sing along or dance a  minuet.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis isn&#39;t about prizes, it&#39;s about music and playing being satisfying for  <br/>\ntheir own sake.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIn school if a kid loves painting but is forced to do photography and  <br/>\nsculpture to get the six weeks of painting instruction, he might decide &quot;I hate  <br/>\nart&quot; and stop taking art classes.  Some people who say they hate piano  probably <br/>\njust hate the controls and the lack of honest personal attention.   A private <br/>\nlesson is &quot;attention,&quot; but if the teacher&#39;s paying more attention to  the book <br/>\nand the Curriculum than to the individual student, that&#39;s not very  personal.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe story of the kid whose teacher said &quot;too hard for you&quot; was sad.   They <br/>\ncould&#39;ve done four measures at a time, or one hand at a time, or turn it  into a <br/>\nduet, or the teacher might have (had he had such an awareness, creativity  <br/>\nand willingness) found pieces that were easier versions of the KINDS of things  <br/>\nnecessary for that other piece to come within the student&#39;s range of ability  <br/>\nmore quickly.   If that piece was &quot;The Entertainer,&quot; more Schubert  wasn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to help.<br/>\n <br/>\nChildren can be rewarded by feeling truly and directly heard and  seen.

Once I did a 6-week job <br/>\nfor an elementary music teacher on maternity leave. She had a system <br/>\nof giving each class a &quot;ribbon&quot; at the end of each class, their <br/>\nbehavior would determine the color. When I was hired, the principal <br/>\nraved to me about this ribbon system, and I was expected to continue <br/>\nit. <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember one class in particular where their regular classroom <br/>\nteacher would assign extra homework if they came back with any less <br/>\nthan the &quot;best color ribbon.&quot; This class was always so stressed and <br/>\nangry at each other, looking to see who would &quot;blow it&quot; for the <br/>\nwhole class. I believe I finally got smart and picked up the ribbon <br/>\nwhen class began and said, &quot;Here it is. You&#39;re getting it. It&#39;s <br/>\ndone. Now let&#39;s have class.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I hated about it (other than how all it seemed to <br/>\ndo was upset the kids) was that it was so vague. What does it mean <br/>\nto say, &quot;You were good today&quot; or &quot;Mm, you weren&#39;t so good today.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n********************************************************************<br/>\nMore thoughts about my idea for piano ....<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would not be in a group setting. It would *not* be the kind of <br/>\nthing like, &quot;Johnny, you can pick a prize today, but Suzy, you <br/>\ncan&#39;t.&quot; The points or prizes would not be announced or posted <br/>\nanywhere, although I guess some kids could choose to discuss it if <br/>\nthey wanted to on their own time, but that&#39;s their choice and I <br/>\ncould actually picture some of them getting a kick out of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I think the only reason I would even consider something like <br/>\nthis is because it&#39;s so concrete. Bring your book, get a point. <br/>\nChoose to memorize a piece, get a point. Or not. It&#39;s not a matter <br/>\nof trying to please me, or me saying, &quot;Johnny plays better than <br/>\nSuzy.&quot;  I remember my piano teacher when I was a kid would actually <br/>\ngrade each lesson, and I hated that, and I would hate doing it as a <br/>\nteacher. How do I even decide something like that?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as me not wanting to give points about practice time ... I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to encourage more &quot;minutes&quot; spent at the piano, because I <br/>\nthink a lot of times kids (like me) will check the clock a hundred <br/>\ntimes, hoping they&#39;re &quot;almost done&quot; and deliberately wasting time <br/>\nand not even enjoying it or really even doing anything. I don&#39;t want <br/>\nto encourage time on the bench; if fact, I want to move them as far <br/>\naway as possible from being concerned about &quot;time.&quot; In fact, I hope <br/>\nto make them more efficient so they can do what they want in *less* <br/>\ntime, not more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the feedback.

Example:  teacher had a basket with goodies for the end of the <br/>\nweek and many kids never got anything because their behavior was never &quot;good <br/>\nenough&quot;.  The children would line up outside waiting for their transportation <br/>\nand several would have treats and many wouldn&#39;t.  There would be bickering among <br/>\nthe kids and name calling, &quot;you&#39;re a bad kid so you don&#39;t get any&quot; or &quot;Ms. So&<br/>\nSo doesn&#39;t like you.&quot;  Once a kid took another kids&#39; treat and ate it.  Not a <br/>\ncool thing to observe.  And better yet, parent&#39;s were asked to help stock <br/>\nthese treats and I remember one Mom brought those push pop things and her kid <br/>\nnever got any and he was in hysterics one day because he &quot;couldn&#39;t even have his <br/>\nown Mommy&#39;s treats.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt probably depends on the kids, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about just a constant thing after each lesson?  Or once a week?  Like a <br/>\nmovie and popcorn after the week is through?  Maybe they could each bring games <br/>\nto play one day a week?

Like my old preschool class, we were encouraged to give stuff for good <br/>\nbehavior but I couldn&#39;t stand to leave kids out so I gave everybody something and <br/>\nthe kids who did &quot;really well&quot; got two.  I guess if they all understand that <br/>\nthey may not get the rewards and they are OK with it, then it would work.  If <br/>\nyou have the time and desire to help set personal goals for each kid so that <br/>\nthey are achieving their own things, that could work.
