It led me to consider homeschooling, <br/>\nwhile looking up how to deal with my spirited child. I don&#39;t think the <br/>\nunschooling page was there back then, but i found it before i subbed to this <br/>\ngroup. Thank you Ned, Luz, and others here for your continued guidance and <br/>\nsupport. It changes lives, and we are grateful. :0)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had the great fortune of meeting a local influence, a lady that <br/>\ncreated a resource online for Columbus, Ohio homeschoolers. Her website made <br/>\nthe Ohio requirements not as intimidating as they appeared, and gave me the <br/>\ncourage to go for it. I got to meet her by chance because it is a very small <br/>\nworld. She has stopped updating her page but it remains online, she has <br/>\nteenaged children and is at the end of her homeschooling years. She had no <br/>\nidea that she affected my life so, and was glad to hear it. I told her I am <br/>\nhoping to carry on the torch for the next generation. I may start an <br/>\nunschooling group locally, where none exists that I can find. I hope to <br/>\nsomeday help others the way I have been helped. <br/>\nAng<br/>\nSAHM to<br/>\nMegan Elizabeth 8/8/92 8lbs 8oz<br/>\nAshlyn Olivia 7/25/99 9lbs 8oz<br/>\n Christian James 6/09/01 9lbs 5oz<br/>\n*NEW* &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/megamom08/hometour.html&quot;\">http://www.geocities.com/megamom08/hometour.html&quot;</a>&gt;Ang&#39;s Virtual Home Tour&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.twgallery.8m.com/MEGAMOM08.html&quot;\">http://www.twgallery.8m.com/MEGAMOM08.html&quot;</a>&gt;Meet MEGAMOM08&lt;/A&gt;   <br/>\n &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/christian.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/christian.html&quot;</a>&gt;Christian&#39;s Birth Story&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/mygirlspage.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/mygirlspage.html&quot;</a>&gt;My Girls page&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n|w|w|<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: 2116 -- More on Unschooling","postDate":"1024520788","msgId":38420,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMDNqSjh1VDZTc3VvdDBPVUkwMDAwMDM3NkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":38411,"nextInTopic":38642,"prevInTime":38419,"nextInTime":38421,"topicId":38411,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... www.Borntoexplore.org/unschool The webmaster generously alloted a page to Luz and me to include a few of our articles.

I&#39;m even thinking about printing <br/>\nout a couple of your articles to keep in my wallet to hand to people when <br/>\nthey ask why or how we homeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had several people comment to me this morning about how &quot;smart&quot; my dd <br/>\nCasey is. We were at a library activity. I tried to explain that she was <br/>\njust excited to be there and eager to participate. The parents heard that we <br/>\nhomeschool and commented how &quot;that explains it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could have had time to explain to them that Casey, who had handed <br/>\nin 5 reading sheets for the library game, has never had a reading lesson. <br/>\nShe&#39;s never done a unit on Japan or origami. I never forced her to sit <br/>\nquietly in a reading group or raise her hand to answer one of the <br/>\nlibrarian&#39;s questions. Yet there she was, smiling, happy and eager to <br/>\nparticipate.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW I noticed you live in Guilford. We&#39;re coming east from Utah next week <br/>\nfor a wedding and will be staying in Guilford. Small world. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":36888606,"authorName":"Luz Shosie and Ned Vare","from":"Luz Shosie and Ned Vare &lt;nedvare@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: 2116 -- More on Unschooling","postDate":"1024500961","msgId":38411,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5MzUyRDgyLkJCMyVuZWR2YXJlQG50cGx4Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjQ0MTE4MTUuNDYwLjY4MDkxLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":38420,"prevInTime":38410,"nextInTime":38412,"topicId":38411,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Group, For another website on unschooling, go to www.Borntoexplore.org/unschool The webmaster generously alloted a page to Luz and me to include a few of our","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1028774284\">Group, <br/>\n<br/>\nFor another website on unschooling, go to www.Borntoexplore.org/unschool<br/>\nThe webmaster generously alloted a page to Luz and me to include a few of<br/>\nour articles.<br/>\nPlease send your comments to this group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Ned Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38632,"nextTopicId":38565}}
