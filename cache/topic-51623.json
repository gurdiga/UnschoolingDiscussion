Sometimes acquaintances though, would do that thing<br/>\nI hate, &quot;what&#39;s the magic word?&quot;, but of course, he didn&#39;t know what they<br/>\nwere wanting from him.   I must have grumbled more than once about it to<br/>\nmy brother, who simply and quietly told Dylan people just wanted to hear<br/>\n&quot;thank you&quot; but a more creative answer would be funny.   So for a while,<br/>\nwhen Dylan was two and three, when someone would ask &quot;what&#39;s the magic<br/>\nword?&quot;   he would reply &quot;Abracadabra!&quot;&lt;g&gt;<br/>\nMaybe it wasn&#39;t very respectful but at the time it was satisfying.   (for<br/>\nme, anyway)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is a please and thank you and excuse me kid now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you can do the things your kids want AND remind them people will<br/>\nfeel happier about doing nice things for them if they ask in a nice way. <br/>\n(but you have to say it nicely&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDylan used to have a friend who got swatted a lot.   It was disturbing to<br/>\na kid who wasn&#39;t used to seeing people hit.   Bradey would hit, or try to<br/>\nhit when he was mad, too, so I would tell him we weren&#39;t a hitting<br/>\nfamily, we were a lovey family and he couldn&#39;t hit when he was with us.  <br/>\nIt worked, maybe because he realized no one would be swatting him at our<br/>\nhouse. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could remind your kids you are a polite family when they demand<br/>\nsomething.  &quot;We&#39;re not the bossy family, we&#39;re the polite family&quot; said<br/>\nwith some humor and sweetness?  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51614,"nextTopicId":51387}}
