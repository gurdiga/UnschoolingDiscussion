He used to enter us into events that he knew we would <br/>\nlose, just to keep us humble. I had grown up with a you-must-win <br/>\nmentality from previous coaches, so I found his attitude very <br/>\nrefreshing. He was always pushing us to try new things, even if we <br/>\nknew we wouldn&#39;t be &quot;good&quot; at them. He always emphasized that what <br/>\ndefined &quot;good&quot; lay in the enjoyment of the sport, not in the winning <br/>\nor losing. He really lived this example too, since he still swam in <br/>\nMaster&#39;s swimming and had a lifelong love of many different sports. A <br/>\nlot of people who were very into competitive sports at an early age <br/>\nwere completely burnt out by college, but he felt that he would be a <br/>\nsuccess if he could help us all to enjoy what we were doing as much <br/>\nas wanting to win. I don&#39;t know exactly how to pass any of that on, <br/>\nbut I found it very inspiring at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of the best things I do for my kids is to let them see me <br/>\nlose, and let them see that I still really enjoy myself. I remember <br/>\none of the first triathlons that my son watched me finish, he came <br/>\nrunning up and asked me if I had won. When I said &quot;no&quot;, he looked <br/>\nincredibly disappointed, so I explained that I might not ever win, <br/>\nbut that I did this sport because I loved it, and that was what was <br/>\nimportant. So, in small ways or big, if there are ways that we show <br/>\nour kids that winning isn&#39;t everything, I think that goes a long <br/>\nways. Maybe when playing cards or some non-sport activity, you could <br/>\ndiscuss it in a context that isn&#39;t so personally threatening to him?<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":123062302,"authorName":"Mica","from":"&quot;Mica&quot; &lt;ghal9720@...&gt;","profile":"micaherself","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"how to help child cope with &quot;always losing&quot;","postDate":"1035169393","msgId":47072,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMyNzhhZSQ2NTg2ZjA2MCQyOGExMzNjYkBoYWxsYW0+","inReplyToHeader":"PDU3LjEzOWJlYzBiLjJhZTM2MDcyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46924,"nextInTopic":47085,"prevInTime":47071,"nextInTime":47073,"topicId":46895,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Lately my son has spoken of his sadness, frustration and disappointment that his friend always beats him (in their backyard games of football or cricket).
