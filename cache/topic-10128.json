I guess we could make an analogy to countries that use<br/>\n physical punishment for criminals,  it is the job of the country to &quot;train&quot;<br/>\n in a sense the citizens.  Or at least the job of the country to keep the<br/>\n citizens inline with the laws.  I have lived in a country that practices<br/>\n physical punishment, and I have to say that there was very little crime<br/>\n there.  The consequences of sure and swift harsh punishment was a deterrent<br/>\n to crime.<br/>\n <br/>\n I don&#39;t spank my kids because they don&#39;t do what I want them to do, I spank<br/>\n them because they willingly and knowingly break the rules.  We use spanking<br/>\n along with other consequences.  I do not hit my children, there is a<br/>\n difference.  I was abused as a child, so I know full well what beating is.<br/>\n Spanking is not done because I am angry, but as a consequence for actions.<br/>\n Beating is done in anger for often unknown reasons.<br/>\n <br/>\n You asked why kids have to be spanked more than once if it stops<br/>\n disobedience.  We can ask the same thing of any form of correction, can&#39;t<br/>\n we?  Why do you have to put kids in &quot;time out&quot;, ground a teenager, take away<br/>\n a privilege, or give extra work more than once if these are designed to stop<br/>\n disobedience?  They have to be done more than once because it is a long job<br/>\n to teach our children.  Some things they will do once and never again,<br/>\n others they will do over and over.<br/>\n <br/>\n When we work with our calves to teach them to lead, they do not learn about<br/>\n the halter the fist time we work with them.  It takes a lot of time to teach<br/>\n them that when the halter is on, they go where we want them to go.  We do it<br/>\n by making it uncomfortable for them when they stop, and comfortable for them<br/>\n when they go.  I am not trying to equate children with animals here, just<br/>\n the concept that it takes time to teach.

And certainly not by someone who I<br/>\nlove and trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo (other than my fear, which I grant doesn&#39;t happen very often, that the child<br/>\nis seriously physically harmed by spanking, because I believe most parents who<br/>\nuse physical punishment really do love their children), my real objection is<br/>\nthat spanking a child does not communicate a realistic picture of consequences.<br/>\nAnd I imagine that is a problem, for if a child learns that what goes on in<br/>\ntheir own family does NOT teach how the world really works, they may learn to<br/>\ndistrust their entire family experience.  I don&#39;t say they WILL, but they MAY --<br/>\nand I have met too many people in my experience who actually did.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I wish both sides in this one would chill out. Let&#39;s agree that most people<br/>\nwho spank love their children.  Let&#39;s agree that most spanking does not leave<br/>\nlong-lasting physical scars.  Let&#39;s agree that adults don&#39;t get spanked (except<br/>\nthe few who choose it for pleasure), nor are they tortured by authorities when<br/>\nthey commit crimes, so that if children are learning consequences, it is a very<br/>\nindirect and not very &quot;efficient&quot; way to communicate the lesson.  Let&#39;s agree<br/>\nthat overall, we know little about the side effects. Let&#39;s also agree that the<br/>\nside effects may be changing as social attitudes toward physical punishment have<br/>\nchanged (so that, oddly enough, they could be different  today than they used to<br/>\nbe.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s agree that, regardless of our differences on this issue, our job is to<br/>\ncherish these bits of star-stuff gathered, for they are the only real future we<br/>\nwill ever see.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n--<br/>\nI will touring the East Coast September 1-19, giving homeschooling talks and<br/>\nworkshops related to &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me&quot;.

I would hate<br/>\nto teach that idea of love to ANYONE...much less a small person who is just<br/>\nbeginning to get a handle on how the world works.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, Dia, this will go around and around with no conclusion. I am<br/>\ncompletely perplexed at how you can wave a flag of &quot;moms who stay at home love<br/>\ntheir children more/are better parents/are more conscientious.&quot; and also insist<br/>\nthat spanking is in the best interest of a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is really all I&#39;m going to say on the subject. I think what is irritating<br/>\nme about this unschooling list is there are 3 or 4 people who seem to have<br/>\nseveral thousand hours a day on their hands to post messages, and their views<br/>\nrun completely contrary to mine. I just don&#39;t have the time, energy,  or desire<br/>\nto keep up with these discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nlivelifelove<br/>\nLainie<br/>\n<br/>\nDia Garland wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; why else does a parent spank unless they are angry with their child&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; behaior? If you&#39;re not angry you wouldn&#39;t need o discipline in any form.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe you only discipline when you are angry, but you are in the minority<br/>\n&gt; there.  A loving parent disciplines when the child needs correction, not<br/>\n&gt; because the kid is being a brat.  I can be unhappy with the behavior of my<br/>\n&gt; child without being angry at the child, and when my children disobey rules,<br/>\n&gt; they need correction, guidance, discipline, whatever you call it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do your children ever disobey your rules?  Do they ever do something<br/>\n&gt; dangerous?  Unless you have *no* rules, they have indeed broken rules at<br/>\n&gt; some point.  What you did as a result of the child&#39;s actions is discipline.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Discipline is designed to teach, correct, to disciple.  We want to teach our<br/>\n&gt; children right from wrong.  Therefore, when they exhibit wrong behavior<br/>\n&gt; (taking a toy from another child, sneaking a cookie, whatever), we teach<br/>\n&gt; them that that behavior is wrong.  We also administer correction in some<br/>\n&gt; form because our actions have consequences.  Bad actions have bad<br/>\n&gt; consequences, good actions have good consequences.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is because parents have *not* taught their children these simple facts<br/>\n&gt; that we see so many kids today who sincerely believe that they do not have<br/>\n&gt; to suffer the consequences of their actions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dia<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Free, Unlimited Calls Anywhere!<br/>\n&gt; Visit Firetalk.com - click below.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/5479/14/_/448294/_/962229614/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/5479/14/_/448294/_/962229614/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To Unsubscribe: mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Dia Garland","from":"&quot;Dia Garland&quot; &lt;moocow@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"kCAo88KKekUNBcBa-dU8y2rx3CBelMKe7fBFz1EX-RaXAYNdlSlrkKVt8IFo7heJIDyq6em-cm8XKv4aEb1hVoQZkPblIyo","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] spanking","postDate":"962324512","msgId":10297,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNWYwMWJmZTIyOSQzMTNlZDBjMCQxODAxMDIwYUBwMz4=","referencesHeader":"PGI0Ljc0ZDVlYzEuMjY4YzVkYTFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":10280,"nextInTopic":10299,"prevInTime":10296,"nextInTime":10298,"topicId":10128,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I want to just start out by being very clear to everyone that I am talking about what we do in ***my*** family here, and I am answering a direct question, so","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-577029279\">I want to just start out by being very clear to everyone that I am talking<br/>\nabout what we do in ***my*** family here, and I am answering a direct<br/>\nquestion, so please do not post nasty messages about being &quot;judgmental&quot;.<br/>\nGot it???<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; So if you and I were making a tuna salad together and I told you to get<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; mayo and you handed me something else and I said &quot;no I said get me the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>mayo<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; not the butter&quot; and you still didn&#39;t do as I asked it would be ok to spank<br/>\n&gt; you for disobeying me?

It is not my job to train my peers, it is my job to<br/>\ntrain my kids.  I guess we could make an analogy to countries that use<br/>\nphysical punishment for criminals,  it is the job of the country to &quot;train&quot;<br/>\nin a sense the citizens.  Or at least the job of the country to keep the<br/>\ncitizens inline with the laws.  I have lived in a country that practices<br/>\nphysical punishment, and I have to say that there was very little crime<br/>\nthere.  The consequences of sure and swift harsh punishment was a deterrent<br/>\nto crime.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t spank my kids because they don&#39;t do what I want them to do, I spank<br/>\nthem because they willingly and knowingly break the rules.  We use spanking<br/>\nalong with other consequences.  I do not hit my children, there is a<br/>\ndifference.  I was abused as a child, so I know full well what beating is.<br/>\nSpanking is not done because I am angry, but as a consequence for actions.<br/>\nBeating is done in anger for often unknown reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou asked why kids have to be spanked more than once if it stops<br/>\ndisobedience.  We can ask the same thing of any form of correction, can&#39;t<br/>\nwe?  Why do you have to put kids in &quot;time out&quot;, ground a teenager, take away<br/>\na privilege, or give extra work more than once if these are designed to stop<br/>\ndisobedience?  They have to be done more than once because it is a long job<br/>\nto teach our children.  Some things they will do once and never again,<br/>\nothers they will do over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we work with our calves to teach them to lead, they do not learn about<br/>\nthe halter the fist time we work with them.  It takes a lot of time to teach<br/>\nthem that when the halter is on, they go where we want them to go.  We do it<br/>\nby making it uncomfortable for them when they stop, and comfortable for them<br/>\nwhen they go.  I am not trying to equate children with animals here, just<br/>\nthe concept that it takes time to teach.  Once is not enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate your posts Dawn!<br/>\n<br/>\nDia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"susan wilson","from":"susan wilson &lt;fxfireob@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"FZrqZEcG8eV7Ga4LAuckGSEqL1eog1FXfsBUBcCYaYthN8J0tGwdsvFtKy08xZ_xXG5sMd0PNsMBBOfJ9QUy6_mz8IOD0Xoa","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] spanking","postDate":"962316079","msgId":10280,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNjI5MjE1OC5RQUEyMTQwN0BidW55aXAuZmxhc2gubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":10268,"nextInTopic":10297,"prevInTime":10278,"nextInTime":10281,"topicId":10128,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hi dia, all i know is that if and when i spank my son i have always seen it(w/out fail) as a failure on my part.  i understand the tempation to take the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1301493501\">hi dia,<br/>\n<br/>\nall i know is that if and when i &#39;spank&#39;

their way in a timely <br/>\nfashion.  so if you choose to spank that is your right and you will <br/>\nnever find me rallying for more laws which interfere w/ the rights of <br/>\nparents.  but for me the price of spanking it just to high and i will <br/>\nhope that this will be true for more and more parents as time goes by. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nas you can see from the quotes below there is much research that says <br/>\nat the very least there are risks in the use of punishment to control <br/>\nchildren.  what i have consciously choosen to use is a balance between <br/>\ntrust, understanding, and the authority which naturally grows out of <br/>\nthis type of relationship.  so please do not tell me that the fact <br/>\nthat i respect my son (as well as myself) enough to resist controlling <br/>\nhim via punishment and instead treat him w/ love, and compassionate <br/>\nunderstanding that my family is contributing to the degradation of <br/>\namerican society.  yes our society has some major problems and one of <br/>\nthem is that people point their fingers at everyone but themselves.  <br/>\nthe truth is there is enough blame for everyone.  why don&#39;t you take <br/>\nyour piece, be it big or small, and improve life in american - i know <br/>\nmy back yard is messy enough w/ out me having to go pick on you.  if <br/>\nwe fix ourselves and not be so worried about others, things may just <br/>\nbegin to get better. <br/>\n<br/>\nhere are some quotes concerning punishment:<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;punishing does teach long lasting lessons...  regardless of what we <br/>\nare trying to get across by spanking, paddling, or slapping them, the <br/>\nmessage that actually comes through are these: &quot;violence is an <br/>\nacceptible way of expressing anger&quot; and &quot;if you are powerful enough <br/>\nyou can get away with hurting someone.&quot;  for decades, researchers have <br/>\nconsistently found that children subjected to physical punishment tend <br/>\nto be more agressive than their peers, and will likely grow up to use <br/>\nviolence on their own children.  these effects are not confined to <br/>\nvictums of what is legally classified as abuse: even &quot;acceptable&quot; <br/>\nlevels of physical punishment may perpetuate aggression and <br/>\nunhappiness&quot;        -alfie kohn: punished by rewards (p.167)<br/>\n(footnote 22 from p167:  &#39;research documenting the detrimental effects <br/>\nof physical punishment has been published since at least the 1940&#39;s.  <br/>\none interesting study found a clearcut relationship between the <br/>\nseverity of the punishment received by eight-year-olds and how <br/>\naggressive their peers judge them to be.  more than 2 decades later, <br/>\nthe researchers tracked down some of these same subjects and found <br/>\nthat the aggressive children had grown into agressive adults, many of <br/>\nwhom were now using physical punishment on their own children... even <br/>\nmore recent research has found that toddlers who are hit by their <br/>\nmothers are in fact less likely than their peers to do what they are <br/>\ntold... and that three-to-five-year-olds who are spanked by their <br/>\nparents are more likely than other children to be aggressive while <br/>\nplaying at day care centers.&#39;)<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;the word &quot;discipline&quot; derives from the latin word disciplina, meaning <br/>\n&quot;instruction&quot; or &quot;method&quot;.  disciplining children should therefore <br/>\nteach them something.  the purpose of punishing is to make someone <br/>\nsuffer.  making children suffer punishment may teach them humiliation, <br/>\nrebellion, or vengefulness, but it rarely teaches them anything about <br/>\ncorrecting behavior.&#39;

Before I had Max one day Zak decided to make a cake on<br/>\n&gt;his own... I went to the bathroom and the phone rang.  I picked it up in the<br/>\n&gt;bedroom and slowly wandered back into the kitchen, only to find about 10lbs<br/>\n&gt;(and I&#39;m not kidding) of flour covering everything in the kitchen.  Now as<br/>\n&gt;you guys know flour is like dust and was absolutely everywhere.  I was<br/>\n&gt;exhausted and 7 months pregnant and sick and all I could think about was that<br/>\n&gt;I wanted to wring his neck and hit him so hard that he&#39;d be knocked out<br/>\n&gt;(thinking about it and doing it are two different things)  However, in a<br/>\n&gt;split second I stopped myself from reacting and started asking him what he<br/>\n&gt;was doing.  He told me it was snow and it was snowing in the kitchen.  He<br/>\n&gt;wanted to see what it would be like to have snow everywhere.  I told him that<br/>\n&gt;when he&#39;d finished playing snow (there was no flour left) we would be<br/>\n&gt;cleaning the kitchen instead of going to the park, which was where we were<br/>\n&gt;suppose to go... He cried and threw a tantrum about not going to the park as<br/>\n&gt;I calmly explained to him that this was a consequence of his behavior and<br/>\n&gt;that we needed to clean this mess up... It was an amazing experience for me.<br/>\n&gt;Now we talk about consequences all the time and the choices we make in the<br/>\n&gt;things we do and he seems to understand.

My kids are 19, 16, 13, 10. So I have a fair bit of experience too, <br/>\n&gt;Deb.<br/>\n&gt;The little spanking I did with my older children did nothing but harm. My <br/>\n&gt;younger<br/>\n&gt;ones are far better off for not being &#39;spanked&#39;. I believe that spanking is <br/>\n&gt;abuse,<br/>\n&gt;but I see no point in arguing about it as I have never seen people learn <br/>\n&gt;through<br/>\n&gt;words.

I thought<br/>\n&gt;unschoolers disliked the artificial environment of schoolish learning where<br/>\n&gt;it is important to learn a bunch of facts because they will be on a test <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;if you don&#39;t learn them you will have the very artificial consequence of<br/>\n&gt;performing poorly on the test.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does anyone else see the similarity between saying that bad actions have <br/>\n&gt;bad<br/>\n&gt;consequences and I will teach you that by imposing the artificial<br/>\n&gt;consequence of spanking you when you do what I consider to be a bad action?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That attitude in school teaches many unintended lessons. Learning isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;important, getting a good grade on the test is. Knowing about a subject<br/>\n&gt;isn&#39;t as important as knowing what your teacher thinks is important. Since<br/>\n&gt;it is important to get good grades, cheating may become an acceptable<br/>\n&gt;option. Cheating is only possible for getting grades, not for learning.<br/>\n&gt;Notice that if learning is important, there is also no reason to cheat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Spanking also teaches many unintended lessons. The biggest person gets to<br/>\n&gt;make the rules. It is okay to hurt someone if you don&#39;t like what they are<br/>\n&gt;doing. Might makes right. Don&#39;t get caught. Lying may become an acceptable<br/>\n&gt;option if you are trying to avoid physical punishment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There are lots of studies to show that positive reinforcement is much more<br/>\n&gt;effective than negative reinforcement. Spanking is never necessary to teach<br/>\n&gt;or correct. There are lots of options and the best one is to avoid the<br/>\n&gt;problem to begin with. The best dog trainers will tell you that instead of<br/>\n&gt;swatting a dog on the nose with a newspaper because he had an accident in<br/>\n&gt;the house, you should take him outside after every meal and at regular<br/>\n&gt;intervals between meals so he doesn&#39;t have the chance of having an accident<br/>\n&gt;in the house.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Frankly, I have always been horrified by the thought of a parent who can<br/>\n&gt;&quot;calmly, and lovingly&quot; spank their child.

I thought<br/>\nunschoolers disliked the artificial environment of schoolish learning where<br/>\nit is important to learn a bunch of facts because they will be on a test and<br/>\nif you don&#39;t learn them you will have the very artificial consequence of<br/>\nperforming poorly on the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone else see the similarity between saying that bad actions have bad<br/>\nconsequences and I will teach you that by imposing the artificial<br/>\nconsequence of spanking you when you do what I consider to be a bad action?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat attitude in school teaches many unintended lessons. Learning isn&#39;t<br/>\nimportant, getting a good grade on the test is. Knowing about a subject<br/>\nisn&#39;t as important as knowing what your teacher thinks is important. Since<br/>\nit is important to get good grades, cheating may become an acceptable<br/>\noption. Cheating is only possible for getting grades, not for learning.<br/>\nNotice that if learning is important, there is also no reason to cheat.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpanking also teaches many unintended lessons. The biggest person gets to<br/>\nmake the rules. It is okay to hurt someone if you don&#39;t like what they are<br/>\ndoing. Might makes right. Don&#39;t get caught. Lying may become an acceptable<br/>\noption if you are trying to avoid physical punishment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of studies to show that positive reinforcement is much more<br/>\neffective than negative reinforcement. Spanking is never necessary to teach<br/>\nor correct. There are lots of options and the best one is to avoid the<br/>\nproblem to begin with. The best dog trainers will tell you that instead of<br/>\nswatting a dog on the nose with a newspaper because he had an accident in<br/>\nthe house, you should take him outside after every meal and at regular<br/>\nintervals between meals so he doesn&#39;t have the chance of having an accident<br/>\nin the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, I have always been horrified by the thought of a parent who can<br/>\n&quot;calmly, and lovingly&quot; spank their child. I have more sympathy with a parent<br/>\nwho momentarily &quot;loses&quot; it but can later apologize and admit that they acted<br/>\nin anger.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, where did I put my flame-proof suit. There it is. Give me a second to<br/>\nget it zipped.

We&#39;ve come to the conclusion that we <br/>\ncannot tell Zak not to hit people and then hit him.  It&#39;s just not logical <br/>\nand my experience of life has been that children follow what you do rather <br/>\nthan what you say.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s very hard not to hit him when he&#39;s done something I don&#39;t like... <br/>\nHowever I do stop and look at why I&#39;m angry with the behavior... I ask myself <br/>\n&quot;how much does this really matter?&quot;  &quot;Is this really a problem for me or <br/>\nhim&quot;.  For example... Before I had Max one day Zak decided to make a cake on <br/>\nhis own... I went to the bathroom and the phone rang.  I picked it up in the <br/>\nbedroom and slowly wandered back into the kitchen, only to find about 10lbs <br/>\n(and I&#39;m not kidding) of flour covering everything in the kitchen.  Now as <br/>\nyou guys know flour is like dust and was absolutely everywhere.  I was <br/>\nexhausted and 7 months pregnant and sick and all I could think about was that <br/>\nI wanted to wring his neck and hit him so hard that he&#39;d be knocked out <br/>\n(thinking about it and doing it are two different things)  However, in a <br/>\nsplit second I stopped myself from reacting and started asking him what he <br/>\nwas doing.  He told me it was snow and it was snowing in the kitchen.  He <br/>\nwanted to see what it would be like to have snow everywhere.  I told him that <br/>\nwhen he&#39;d finished playing snow (there was no flour left) we would be <br/>\ncleaning the kitchen instead of going to the park, which was where we were <br/>\nsuppose to go... He cried and threw a tantrum about not going to the park as <br/>\nI calmly explained to him that this was a consequence of his behavior and <br/>\nthat we needed to clean this mess up... It was an amazing experience for me.  <br/>\nNow we talk about consequences all the time and the choices we make in the <br/>\nthings we do and he seems to understand.  It doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t do <br/>\nthings that I don&#39;t like, however he knows that sometimes there is a <br/>\nconsequence to his behavior that he doesn&#39;t like and he has a choice in the <br/>\nactions he takes.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my little input<br/>\nDawn F</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"susan wilson","from":"susan wilson &lt;fxfireob@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"1njjo95qcMf7kIciFQ-0niO5wlhFesM6Pxo6OrSH7P8rh5RbqgnBddpP-n7G9mkMhxgp4u-UX860WHRXfiU1j1k5_tG57X3s","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] spanking","postDate":"962232275","msgId":10147,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNjI4MjI0MS5SQUEwNzM0M0BvZ29wb2dvLmZsYXNoLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":10144,"nextInTopic":10150,"prevInTime":10146,"nextInTime":10148,"topicId":10128,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... of their ... i agree! ... i did and it sucked!  i still flinch to this day and i m 40! -susan austin, tx ... long ... my ... can ... with ... does ... is ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-664673478\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; imo the only thing spanking accomplishes is making children afraid <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of their<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; parents.<br/>\n </span></blockquote> i agree! <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; how would you like it if you got hi every time you made a mistake?<br/>\n&gt; amy<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>i did and it sucked!  i still flinch to this day and i&#39;m 40!<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin, tx<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; i don&#39;t believe any research has bore this out.  i have to say imo<br/>\n&gt;&gt; spanking falls more in the realm of tradition i.e. &#39;old habits die<br/>\n&gt;&gt; hard&#39;.   so we&#39;ll do anything to justify our need to control rather<br/>\n&gt;&gt; than acknowledge maybe we have been doing things wrong for a very <br/>\n </span></blockquote>long<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; time.  i think this is especially true with parents not appologizing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to their children.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; if a parent finds a &#39;justifible&#39; need to spank their child imo they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; should take a long hard look at their relationship w/ that child and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ask themselves some hard questions like &#39;just what am i modeling to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>my<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; child that helps foster this unwanted behavior.&#39;   but most people <br/>\n </span></blockquote>can<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; not look at themselves w/ the same critical eye they use on their<br/>\n&gt;&gt; children. it&#39;s just too hard on the ego.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; -susan<br/>\n&gt;&gt; austin,tx<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; .

A loving parent disciplines when the child needs correction, not<br/>\nbecause the kid is being a brat.  I can be unhappy with the behavior of my<br/>\nchild without being angry at the child, and when my children disobey rules,<br/>\nthey need correction, guidance, discipline, whatever you call it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo your children ever disobey your rules?  Do they ever do something<br/>\ndangerous?  Unless you have *no* rules, they have indeed broken rules at<br/>\nsome point.  What you did as a result of the child&#39;s actions is discipline.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline is designed to teach, correct, to disciple.  We want to teach our<br/>\nchildren right from wrong.  Therefore, when they exhibit wrong behavior<br/>\n(taking a toy from another child, sneaking a cookie, whatever), we teach<br/>\nthem that that behavior is wrong.  We also administer correction in some<br/>\nform because our actions have consequences.  Bad actions have bad<br/>\nconsequences, good actions have good consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is because parents have *not* taught their children these simple facts<br/>\nthat we see so many kids today who sincerely believe that they do not have<br/>\nto suffer the consequences of their actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nDia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10403,"nextTopicId":10249}}
