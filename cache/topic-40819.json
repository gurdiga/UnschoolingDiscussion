Almost no<br/>\none uses much of the math they did in school. They use what they need, and<br/>\nif they remember it. Why? It wasn&#39;t relevant to their lives then. (the<br/>\ndidn&#39;t need to know the speed of that train or when it would get to the<br/>\nstation, and cared less)<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, a homeschooler taking a trip across Nebraska who is hungry and hopes<br/>\nto get to a town soon where there might be a restaurant, might take a look<br/>\nat the map and find out when s/he might get dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur kid never studied math at all growing up, but always knew how to figure<br/>\nout things, because math is common sense. Frequent use of money helps a lot.<br/>\nWhen our youngest son decided to go to college, he got a SAT practice book<br/>\nand took the test.  Scored 1390 - higher than half of the Valedictorians in<br/>\nall the high schools in the state. (their scores were published in the<br/>\npaper)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did he do that? I can&#39;t tell you, but he did play lots of games with<br/>\ncomplicated rules, earned his own money, bought his own clothes and his own<br/>\ncomputer with that money. He knew how to find out stuff by knowing how to<br/>\nuse the library...and its computers (catalog)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis boy, in fact, never looked at any school books as he grew up. He got<br/>\nlibrary books by the dozens on subjects that interested him (libraries<br/>\nseldom carry school books -- reason: they&#39;re junky), he liked to go on trips<br/>\nand was the navigator from an early age. He was completely in charge of his<br/>\nown education from the time he came home after ten sessions of Montessori<br/>\nand said he didn&#39;t want to go any more. While we surely made some<br/>\nsuggestions and found out things that were available to kids, such as the<br/>\nlocal crafts center, he like being in charge of his learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn June, he graduated from Hunter College in NYC, after living in his own<br/>\napartment for four years, taking the subway to classes etc. He spent the<br/>\nfour years on the dean&#39;s list and was Magna Cum Laude, a fraction of a point<br/>\nfrom Summa, but not too shabby. Several of the top students were<br/>\nhomeschoolers, as we&#39;ve come to expect.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn college, with no math &quot;to speak of&quot; he took a review course in freshman<br/>\nyear. Scored perfect, as usual. So he knows that math is there when he needs<br/>\nit, and he also knows that the basics are all totally obvious and easy. (we<br/>\ndon&#39;t need endless reviews and/or testing or what we learned cold in second<br/>\ngrade, but that&#39;s one way that schools waste our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just got off the phone with a woman in CT who called for the first time.<br/>\nHer daughter is 13 and enrolled in the local community college. Another girl<br/>\nI know entered a cc in CT at age 11 and is now a junior at 14.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe message is: Learning is easy. Get on with it. It doesn&#39;t even need a<br/>\nname, like &quot;math.&quot; It&#39;s distance, weight, area. etc. Those don&#39;t threaten<br/>\npeople until we say they&#39;re MATH. Then, some kids freeze.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the real list of the uses of math, please go to an article that Luz<br/>\nwrote, called &quot;A Few Words About Math&quot;  at www.borntoexplore.org/unschool<br/>\nyou&#39;ll like it, I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes, <br/>\n<br/>\nNed</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40817,"nextTopicId":40823}}
