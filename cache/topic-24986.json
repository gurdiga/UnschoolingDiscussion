His mother is a Waldorf <br/>\n&gt; School teacher, and he&#39;s been in the school since Kindergarten. His <br/>\n&gt; class no longer has a teacher, so I am pursuing my ideal of <br/>\n&gt; homeschooling. His mother is stuck on the Waldorf thing, and I value a <br/>\n&gt; lot of what it has given to him. But I&#39;m curious about the unschooling <br/>\n&gt; concept. Does anyone out there have any experience with Waldorf <br/>\n&gt; Education, and the comparison between the two approaches?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Welcome Mark:<br/>\n<br/>\nI just took Zak out of Waldorf.  He was only there 5 days.  The things I <br/>\nliked about the Waldorf is that they are gentle spirits, it&#39;s very &quot;granola&quot;, <br/>\nlots of love and attention and affection., only 10 in Zak&#39;s class with 2 <br/>\nteachers.  The things are don&#39;t like about Waldorf are the same as I don&#39;t <br/>\nlike about any school.  (1) It&#39;s not a real environment - kids together of <br/>\nthe same age.  (2) Teacher driven not child led - Zak didn&#39;t get to determine <br/>\nwhen he played outside, it was determined by the teacher.  (3) Control - lots <br/>\nof control in Waldorf, although they don&#39;t appear to be that way.  Example.  <br/>\nZak would not each salad for a snack or soup for a snack so I packed him a <br/>\nHealth Valley Tart Bar and explained to the teacher that I didn&#39;t want him <br/>\ngoing hungry.  At the end of the day she gave it back to me and said &quot;we <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t give it to him because then everyone would want to do this&quot;... My <br/>\nresponse was &quot;so what let them?&quot; she said &quot;well then we would have chaos over <br/>\neating&quot;... I said &quot;maybe you&#39;d learn something from the children about what <br/>\nthey really want to eat and when rather than on your schedule. I insist that <br/>\nZak has the opportunity to eat something else&quot;.... She said &quot;I&#39;ll have to <br/>\ntalk about it with my peers, but I don&#39;t think we can do that&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually think the above scenario was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back <br/>\nabout putting him in any kind of school and bringing him home.  I suddenly <br/>\nrealized that it was all about adults having control over children, just <br/>\nbecause they were bigger and thought that the adult ideas were better than <br/>\nthe kids could come up with.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus it would have cost $600 a month.  We are taking that $600 and bought a <br/>\nplaysystem for our backgarden for the kids for $3500.  So in a few months <br/>\nwe&#39;ll have something that will last them all their childhood and not scar <br/>\nthem as opposed to paying for something to potentially do them harm (the <br/>\nbeing in school).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for convincing your ex... I wouldn&#39;t bother... that&#39;s the reason she&#39;s <br/>\nyour ex... Just start doing the unschooling thing (if that&#39;s the way you want <br/>\nto go) and once she sees the rewards maybe she&#39;ll come around.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead as much as you can as well... I just finished reading Linda Dobson&#39;s The <br/>\nFirst Year of Homeschooling and it was a wonderful help to me and my husband. <br/>\n Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nDawn Falbe  <br/>\nPersonal Development Coach<br/>\nRelocational Astrologer<br/>\n(520) 579-2646<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nThe Path of Least Resistance is Inside of You<br/>\nwww.astrologerdawn.com<br/>\nEnlightening women on how to live their Soul Purpose<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The people who get on in this world<br/>\n are people who get up and look for the<br/>\n circumstances they want, and, <br/>\nif they can&#39;t find them, make them.&quot; - George Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school.&quot;-George <br/>\nBernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24975,"nextTopicId":24902}}
