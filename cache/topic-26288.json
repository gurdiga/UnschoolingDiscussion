When I was pregnant with Zak people <br/>\nwould come up to me all the time and say &quot;you must be so excited and happy <br/>\nabout being pregnant and having this baby (with lots of smiles and cooing at <br/>\nme)&quot;  I would reply &quot;no not really... I&#39;m getting fatter, I&#39;m loosing my <br/>\nbalance, I&#39;ve got stretch marks, I&#39;m petrified of how painful it&#39;s going to <br/>\nbe actually giving birth and knowing I have no control over the experience.  <br/>\nAnd on top of that I have no idea what I&#39;m going to feel for this baby and <br/>\nI&#39;m not happy right now&quot;.... Luckily I was in England at the beginning of my <br/>\npregnancy and I had a lot of friends that had felt the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven  when Zak was born (by that time we were in Las Vegas (military then)) I <br/>\nwas just so glad to get the birth over with and relieved that the pain would <br/>\nend soon,  that I didn&#39;t think about how happy I was.  I wasn&#39;t that happy or <br/>\neven attached to him until a couple of days after he was born.  Different <br/>\nstory with my second one, even though I was sick every day of my pregnancy <br/>\nfor 9 months and it seemed the worst 9 months of my life.... I immediately <br/>\nfelt bonded to my 2nd...<br/>\n<br/>\nSome days I wish I didn&#39;t have children and I was that carefree single <br/>\nbusiness woman, going to the theater, out to dinner, late parties, friends <br/>\nover for drinks, lots of chit chat about the world and interesting things.... <br/>\nthen Max, who will be 2 on Friday, comes to my office (in my house), put&#39;s <br/>\nhis hand under my bum and says &quot;move mummy, come here&quot; and takes my hand and <br/>\nI have to follow him to see what he needs.
