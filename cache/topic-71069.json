A good one?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Disposable digital didn&#39;t even make sense to me, so I googled it:<br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,65463,00.asp\">http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,65463,00.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\n    Before I bought a digital camera, I was having my photos developed by<br/>\n    snapfish.com/  I mailed them my exposed roll, they sent me back photos, but<br/>\n    also posted my photos on their website.  I could copy the photos onto my<br/>\n    computer for email, making greeting cards, etc., and could also send friends<br/>\n    a link to view my photos at snapfish.  You can also have your regular photos<br/>\n    developed right onto CDs.  This type of service is now widely available.<br/>\n<br/>\n    As for price, I recommend thinking first about how you will use your camera.<br/>\n    Do you want to zoom in on your kids?  Do you want to take panoramic photos<br/>\n    while hiking?  You probably won&#39;t get both in a &quot;cheap&quot; digital.  Do you<br/>\n    want a compact camera or do you care more about high quality photos?  Read<br/>\n    reviews.  They are easy to find on-line.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Another price factor to consider is that printing your own digital photos is<br/>\n    not cheap.  Unless you have a very good printer, special paper, and special<br/>\n    ink, none of which are cheap, your photos will have sort of a &quot;newspapery&quot;<br/>\n    look to them.  I still have some of my photos profesionally printed.<br/>\n    (Services for this are widely available - you just bring in your flash card<br/>\n    and they copy the photo from it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n    I love my digital camera for the intant processing of photos.  I can take<br/>\n    photos at my child&#39;s birthday party, and the next day print out custom thank<br/>\n    you notes for each guest.  I email photos of the kids to my mom.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Another factor I love is that it doesn&#39;t cost any more to take lots of extra<br/>\n    photos.  I always take several of each shot, then delete the ones I don&#39;t<br/>\n    like.<br/>\n<br/>\n    We got an extra rechargable battery and an extra large-capacity flash card.<br/>\n    I can&#39;t imagine not having the extra battery.  Digital cameras burn<br/>\n    batteries very quickly!<br/>\n<br/>\n    A factor I hadn&#39;t considered is that digital photography takes up a LOT of<br/>\n    computer disk space.  If you have CD-RW drive, you can copy them onto CDs<br/>\n    though.  If you can figure out how.  I&#39;m still working on that.  Can Kirby<br/>\n    come visit me? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I have a Canon Elph and like the compact size.  It does well at close range,<br/>\n    but not for scenic photos.  It also doesn&#39;t do well in very low light<br/>\n    situations.  Dh wanted to get a more expensive one, but I insisted on having<br/>\n    a camera that I wasn&#39;t afraid to touch!  And this one still cost more than<br/>\n    the nicest still camera I ever bought.  Ours is a couple of years old now.<br/>\n<br/>\n    We bought a Barbie digital for Jackie when she was 6.  It is very low pixle,<br/>\n    but she has a lot of fun with the software that came with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Mary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Yahoo!

They marked it down to $88 at walmart and I got a <br/>\n  refund adjustment. I think they are going to stop carrying it in the <br/>\n  store, the website now says available at walmart.com only. I highly <br/>\n  recommend this camera, we use it for a lot of homeschooling <br/>\n  documentation. <br/>\n<br/>\n  There are also reviews online if you google, that other people love <br/>\n  this economical camera.

I think they have come <br/>\n  down just a little in price.  Other digital cameras with similar <br/>\n  features and quality were around $350.  We really like it and have <br/>\n  had no problems with it so far, we&#39;ve only had it since Christmas, <br/>\n  but we&#39;ve taken tons of pics.  You will probably want to buy a memory <br/>\n  card (CF card).  The camera only holds about 14 pics without the <br/>\n  memory card.

I could copy the photos onto my<br/>\n  computer for email, making greeting cards, etc., and could also send friends<br/>\n  a link to view my photos at snapfish.  You can also have your regular photos<br/>\n  developed right onto CDs.  This type of service is now widely available.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As for price, I recommend thinking first about how you will use your camera.<br/>\n  Do you want to zoom in on your kids?  Do you want to take panoramic photos<br/>\n  while hiking?  You probably won&#39;t get both in a &quot;cheap&quot; digital.  Do you<br/>\n  want a compact camera or do you care more about high quality photos?  Read<br/>\n  reviews.  They are easy to find on-line.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Another price factor to consider is that printing your own digital photos is<br/>\n  not cheap.  Unless you have a very good printer, special paper, and special<br/>\n  ink, none of which are cheap, your photos will have sort of a &quot;newspapery&quot;<br/>\n  look to them.  I still have some of my photos profesionally printed.<br/>\n  (Services for this are widely available - you just bring in your flash card<br/>\n  and they copy the photo from it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I love my digital camera for the intant processing of photos.  I can take<br/>\n  photos at my child&#39;s birthday party, and the next day print out custom thank<br/>\n  you notes for each guest.  I email photos of the kids to my mom.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Another factor I love is that it doesn&#39;t cost any more to take lots of extra<br/>\n  photos.  I always take several of each shot, then delete the ones I don&#39;t<br/>\n  like.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We got an extra rechargable battery and an extra large-capacity flash card.<br/>\n  I can&#39;t imagine not having the extra battery.  Digital cameras burn<br/>\n  batteries very quickly!<br/>\n<br/>\n  A factor I hadn&#39;t considered is that digital photography takes up a LOT of<br/>\n  computer disk space.  If you have CD-RW drive, you can copy them onto CDs<br/>\n  though.  If you can figure out how.  I&#39;m still working on that.  Can Kirby<br/>\n  come visit me? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have a Canon Elph and like the compact size.  It does well at close range,<br/>\n  but not for scenic photos.  It also doesn&#39;t do well in very low light<br/>\n  situations.  Dh wanted to get a more expensive one, but I insisted on having<br/>\n  a camera that I wasn&#39;t afraid to touch!  And this one still cost more than<br/>\n  the nicest still camera I ever bought.  Ours is a couple of years old now.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We bought a Barbie digital for Jackie when she was 6.  It is very low pixle,<br/>\n  but she has a lot of fun with the software that came with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

This type of service is now widely available.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for price, I recommend thinking first about how you will use your camera.<br/>\nDo you want to zoom in on your kids?  Do you want to take panoramic photos<br/>\nwhile hiking?  You probably won&#39;t get both in a &quot;cheap&quot; digital.  Do you<br/>\nwant a compact camera or do you care more about high quality photos?  Read<br/>\nreviews.  They are easy to find on-line.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother price factor to consider is that printing your own digital photos is<br/>\nnot cheap.  Unless you have a very good printer, special paper, and special<br/>\nink, none of which are cheap, your photos will have sort of a &quot;newspapery&quot;<br/>\nlook to them.  I still have some of my photos profesionally printed.<br/>\n(Services for this are widely available - you just bring in your flash card<br/>\nand they copy the photo from it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI love my digital camera for the intant processing of photos.  I can take<br/>\nphotos at my child&#39;s birthday party, and the next day print out custom thank<br/>\nyou notes for each guest.  I email photos of the kids to my mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother factor I love is that it doesn&#39;t cost any more to take lots of extra<br/>\nphotos.  I always take several of each shot, then delete the ones I don&#39;t<br/>\nlike.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got an extra rechargable battery and an extra large-capacity flash card.<br/>\nI can&#39;t imagine not having the extra battery.  Digital cameras burn<br/>\nbatteries very quickly!<br/>\n<br/>\nA factor I hadn&#39;t considered is that digital photography takes up a LOT of<br/>\ncomputer disk space.  If you have CD-RW drive, you can copy them onto CDs<br/>\nthough.  If you can figure out how.  I&#39;m still working on that.  Can Kirby<br/>\ncome visit me? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a Canon Elph and like the compact size.  It does well at close range,<br/>\nbut not for scenic photos.  It also doesn&#39;t do well in very low light<br/>\nsituations.  Dh wanted to get a more expensive one, but I insisted on having<br/>\na camera that I wasn&#39;t afraid to touch!  And this one still cost more than<br/>\nthe nicest still camera I ever bought.  Ours is a couple of years old now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe bought a Barbie digital for Jackie when she was 6.  It is very low pixle,<br/>\nbut she has a lot of fun with the software that came with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4324016,"authorName":"Kelly Lenhart","from":"&quot;Kelly Lenhart&quot; &lt;mina@...&gt;","profile":"mommamina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digital cameras??
