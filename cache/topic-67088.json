Probably the social...&quot;playing with <br/>\nfriends.&quot;  My 10 1/2 dd was taken out of public at the end of second grade <br/>\n(7 1/2).  Over the last 3 years she has had a number of complaints about <br/>\nbeing at home.  Its usually about not having any friends to play with or <br/>\nnot being with her friends.  (They are either at school or doing homework!) <br/>\nTranslate that to mean, &quot;being in the presence of kids or girls at least 7 <br/>\nhours a day.&quot;  When I ask her about the specifics of those hours and what <br/>\nwould she be doing if she were in school and explain what the consequences <br/>\nwould be (homework, spelling tests, etc), she immediately states that she <br/>\nwants nothing to do with that!  She just wants the company!    She would <br/>\nprefer to have someone to play with 24 hours a day and this change has been <br/>\nvery hard for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike her brother who has &quot;buds&quot; that have remained the same since he met <br/>\nthem, my daughter (girls?) doesn&#39;t seem to have that one or two loyal, <br/>\nreliable friend(s) that she can always call upon in a time of need.  She <br/>\nfeels insecure, shy and yet at the same time demanding of her <br/>\nfriends.  Still very wet behind the ears in social skills, and feeling <br/>\nstill &quot;odd-girl-out&quot; being homeschooled, she feels at a disadvantage among <br/>\nthe neighborhood and her school friends .  So they change every day and I <br/>\ncan see where that would be a relatively insecure social arena, unlike the <br/>\nstructure of public school (good or bad).  So we discuss how we can make <br/>\nthat up in other ways, work around the school schedule with her school <br/>\nfriends, and try to meet other homeschool friends.  But in the end I figure <br/>\nthere is only so much that can be done, and she will have to learn to be a <br/>\nlittle more by herself and develop her own interests during those times <br/>\nwhen other friends are not available.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina in Seattle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&lt;&lt;Mainly I am curious to hear if anyone has taken young children out, &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Would you?","postDate":"1051820672","msgId":67237,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzYTcwMWMzMTAyYSQxMzBiODllMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDAxMTEwMWMzMGZiOCQ2YWJlZTNjMCQyZGUwYjVkMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4gPDAwMTUwMWMzMGZlYSQ0NDkzYjJjMCQxODU1NDUxOEBjYS5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":67197,"nextInTopic":67399,"prevInTime":67236,"nextInTime":67238,"topicId":67088,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... teacher who despises the school system, advocates for home learning, and/or massive reform of schools - mostly because of on teachers that end up sounding","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-86398260\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; That teacher should read John Gatto&#39;s &quot;Dumbing Us Down.&quot;  Award winning<br/>\n </span></blockquote>teacher who despises the school system, advocates for home learning, and/or<br/>\nmassive reform of schools - mostly because of on teachers that end up<br/>\nsounding like that passive-aggressive twit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely!

( well actually I know how to do it-we are...) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI made a comment about this one time and got jumped HARD (behind my back, in <br/>\nprint, by an Alaskan homeschooling newsletter).    Here&#39;s my bit (from an <br/>\ninterview):<br/>\n<br/>\nYou believe that unschooling cannot be a part-time affair. Given that, is it <br/>\npossible to unschool one child while another is using a structured <br/>\ncurriculum? What if one child wants to go to school?  <br/>\n<br/>\n I think that spoils the integrity of the set-of-everything, to say, &quot;Math we <br/>\nwon&#39;t risk, but the rest of that you can learn on your own, or not.&quot; It <br/>\ncreates an object and a field. Math is a Must-Know, and the rest is less <br/>\nvaluable. <br/>\n<br/>\n I think setting &quot;academics&quot; apart from the rest of cool stuff to know is <br/>\njust as bad. Is science more important than auto-mechanics? Hey, it is <br/>\nauto-mechanics, everywhere but at school, where auto-mechanics is in one <br/>\nbuilding, and science is in another building, different teacher, different <br/>\nbook, different line on the report card. In real life there are thousands of <br/>\nbuildings, and teachers, and books. <br/>\n<br/>\n If one child in a family is using a curriculum because he or she wants to, <br/>\nand the work is done her own way, that&#39;s not as disruptive as I think it <br/>\nwould be if the parent were inflicting a curriculum on one child while <br/>\nclaiming or attempting to leave another child free to learn naturally. How <br/>\ncould one prevent comparing? <br/>\n<br/>\n What I have recommended and can&#39;t get out of is that if one of my children <br/>\nwanted to go to school, I would go along with it. I think the worst thing <br/>\nabout school is the powerlessness of the students. They have to be there <br/>\nwhether they want to or not. There&#39;s no virtue in those who want to be there, <br/>\nand no joy in those who do not want to be. When families force their children <br/>\nhome when the children would rather have stayed in school, the same <br/>\npowerlessness exists. Part of the reason I would go with it is that I would <br/>\nnot expect it to last. I&#39;ve made their home-life fun. School would have to be <br/>\nfantasyland to compete with what they have at home. <br/>\n<br/>\n If the parent has separated learning from school in his or her mind, the <br/>\npressure on a school-kid will be much lower than if the parent really <br/>\nbelieves school is the source of knowledge and success. <br/>\n<br/>\n While it&#39;s luxuriously easy if everyone in a family is committed to <br/>\nunschooling, I don&#39;t think life will be over for them if some of them are <br/>\ninvolved in formal learning. I think where unschooling and formality are side <br/>\nby side, unschooling will win out every time, because it&#39;s joyous and <br/>\nfriendly. <br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe harsh criticism was over my use of &quot;inflicted.&quot;  They would&#39;ve burned me <br/>\nat the stake had I been a local, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother school-related thing I have pre-written is here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice\">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a><br/>\nand the interview is on the HEM site<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://secure.addy.com/mhegener/HEM/HEM151.98/151.98_art_sd.html\">http://secure.addy.com/mhegener/HEM/HEM151.98/151.98_art_sd.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBoth are linked from <br/>\nsandradodd.com/articles<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92084939,"authorName":"Heidi","from":"&quot;Heidi&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;","profile":"heidic40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Would you?","postDate":"1051799921","msgId":67134,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI4cmJoaCt2Z3BjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTUwMWMzMGZlYSQ0NDkzYjJjMCQxODU1NDUxOEBjYS5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":67126,"nextInTopic":67152,"prevInTime":67133,"nextInTime":67135,"topicId":67088,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... winning teacher who despises the school system, advocates for home learning, and/or massive reform of schools - mostly because of on teachers that end up","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1826422208\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, Tim and Maureen <br/>\n&lt;tmthomas@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That teacher should read John Gatto&#39;s &quot;Dumbing Us Down.&quot;  Award <br/>\n </span></blockquote>winning teacher who despises the school system, advocates for home <br/>\nlearning, and/or massive reform of schools - mostly because of on <br/>\nteachers that end up sounding like that passive-aggressive twit.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; My (angry) thots<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>John Gatto!!!

(knowing they would be def. going back to public school then)<br/>\nIf you knew your 7/8 year old  was  a slow learner and  would probably not be at grade level  for public school in 3 or 4 years  would you still homeschool?<br/>\nOur grandchildren are almost 8. We took them out of public school  half way thru kindergarten. Mostly we did relaxed homeschooling  Sometimes it sure wasnt very &quot;relaxed&quot;  when I would have sessions of &quot;school at home&quot;. and then lose my cool when they balked.<br/>\nOne of the girls is a very &quot;spirited&quot; child- after losing my temper  very badly with her during one of her   more flaming tantrums I said in remorse that if she wished she  could  try public school again and she jumped at it.  This was this past October. She has a  great teacher-and enjoys school usually. If she wants she can stay home anytime and  if home looks more interesting  she occasionally does.<br/>\nHer sister  decided she wanted to try public school  in February. She did not get  a  teacher who took time  with her and she found herself  confused and left aside. She was  not where the rest of her class were  and was hurt  badly  by being made aware of that.<br/>\nShe decided she had had enough after ten days and  decided to go back to homeschooling-which actually is pretty relaxed. She actually feels worse now  as she really would have liked to play with all the kids her twin sister does. There is only one Elementary school in the town. We live   out of town.  There are only a few kids homeschooling in the district and none anywhere near her age.<br/>\nWe really feel we should unschool-we are going to  a Homeschooling Conference in a couple of weeks in Creston,BC and are looking forwards to hearing the two Unschooling  speakers. <br/>\nOf course I know it is strictly our call but after going up and down and around   I am curious enough to see if any of you have  been in similar circumstances and what your take is on it.  <br/>\nI havnt given much background-I tend to go on and on anyway.<br/>\nGrace<br/>\n{Miss Frizzle says &quot;Take Chances-Get Messy-Make Mistakes&quot;}<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Would you?","postDate":"1051771778","msgId":67091,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwNC4yZDY4ZmNiOC4yYmUyMWQ4MkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67088,"nextInTopic":67094,"prevInTime":67090,"nextInTime":67092,"topicId":67088,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/1/03 12:33:57 AM, pennacres@redshift.bc.ca writes:  No. ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1532524575\">In a message dated 5/1/03 12:33:57 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pennacres@...\">pennacres@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Would you unschool if your child  really likes public  school? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If you had  done &quot;school at home&quot;  and  are moving towards unschooling <br/>\nwould that  move you to keeping your child  home from public school even when <br/>\nthey like it?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand that.<br/>\n(After reading the rest of your post I began to understand it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If you knew your 7/8 year old would  probably not be with you in  3 or 4 <br/>\nyears would you still unschool?
