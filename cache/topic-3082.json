My 6yo doesn&#39;t go to<br/>\n&gt; bed until after 10:00 almost every night. Then, by the time I get to use<br/>\n&gt; the computer (DH is on until 11), and log in our days highlights and read<br/>\n&gt; mail, it is midnight. Then I need time to myself to just wind down from the<br/>\n&gt; day. Of course, this is the time that my husband wants my attention. Has<br/>\n&gt; anyone found a solution to this type of situation? Late night is when my<br/>\n&gt; son wants to read and play games with us, so I hate to miss this important<br/>\n&gt; part of our unschooling. But my husband is not happy either. Is this a<br/>\n&gt; common problem for home/unschoolers, when mom&#39;s time comes last at the end<br/>\n&gt; of the day?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Olivia<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 12:27 AM 09/20/1999 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MORELFAM@...\">MORELFAM@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;as i was reading your schedule with the laaaate nights i wondered about the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spousal agreeableness, then later you mentioned it!  i guess it is on my mind<br/>\n&gt; &gt;because i often stay up late (like now) just to get some solitude after a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;long day with the four children.  but hubby wishes i would snuggle in with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;him....   all these needs to deal with (including my own!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;erin<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it out!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Check it out!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2984,"nextTopicId":3084}}
