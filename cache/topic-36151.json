She likes them. Roxana <br/>\n(14) once wanted to be taught how to diagram sentences - I had no clue - but <br/>\nI bought her a workbook. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I think what Sandra is reacting to is that there is a different tone <br/>\nhere in Sandra (mom of 5)&#39;s son&#39;s desire. HE specifically said he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to unschool, that he wants his mom to tell him what to do. In other <br/>\nwords, he isn&#39;t wanting to take responsibility, he is wanting to NOT take it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - Sandra is saying that as unschoolers we should not recommend catering to <br/>\nTHAT aspect of the situation. I agree.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I also think that she can take what he wants (to have his learning <br/>\ncontrolled, to have some sort of guarantee that he&#39;ll be taught &quot;what he <br/>\nneeds to know&quot;, etc.) and offer him something that might appeal to him but <br/>\nstill hand over responsibility to him. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of very cool &quot;learning materials&quot; - and I guess I call them <br/>\ncurriculum, but they aren&#39;t that in the sense that some people mean that. I&#39;m <br/>\nthinking of something like the &quot;Math for Smartypants&quot; book by Marilyn Burns <br/>\nor &quot;The Joy of Mathematics&quot; by Theoni Pappas or maybe some of the Brown Paper <br/>\nSchool books. They are activity-based. The authors speak TO the reader, <br/>\nthey&#39;re not in that weird 3rd person passive tone that most textbooks use. <br/>\nThey follow what is called a &quot;constructivist&quot; theory of mathematical <br/>\neducation - which seems to me to be a good way to get launched into <br/>\nunschooling - which is really, to me, radical constructivism applies to all <br/>\nareas of learning. Here is a little definition of constructivist mathematics <br/>\neducation: &quot;...constructivism is the philosophy that knowledge cannot be <br/>\nprovided in some final form from parent to child or from teacher to student <br/>\nbut must be actively assembled in the mind by each learner in his or her own <br/>\nway. The responsibility for expanding what one knows, or for constructing new <br/>\nknowledge, rests primarily on the learner and his or her efforts to achieve <br/>\nunderstanding.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I do think that it is possible to choose &quot;better or worse&quot; materials and <br/>\nthat if a kid wants &quot;school&quot; - that instead of just getting cheap workbooks <br/>\nand doing school or leaving him floundering by just tossing him &quot;to the <br/>\nworkbooks&quot; (sort of like &quot;to the wolves&quot;) that maybe getting some of these <br/>\nkinds of learning materials - that DO hand the responsiblity for learning <br/>\nover to the learner - is a better step. Let the kid think you&#39;re &quot;doing <br/>\nschool&quot; if that&#39;s what he need to think -- but don&#39;t do it. Instead, come up <br/>\nwith some materials that have activities to do - together or on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\nSome of what is said here may challenge you, shock you, disturb you, or seem <br/>\nharsh.

So we <br/>\ndecided that that would be the best thing for him.  We then gave my dd the <br/>\nchoice of staying or leaving.  After quite a bit of thought, she decided she <br/>\nwanted to be homeschooled.  Neither of them was challenged at all there <br/>\nacademically and were bored to death.  My dd liked the social aspect, which <br/>\nwould have been her only reason for staying, I think.  <br/>\nSo, our first year home I use Sonlight which my long time homeschooling <br/>\nsister reccomended to me.  We got a lot accomplished that year, and the kids <br/>\nseemed to enjoy it, I&#39;d say so far, that&#39;s been our best year at home so far. <br/>\n Probably because a) the kids were just *so* happy and thankful to be home <br/>\nthey&#39;d have done just about anything asked of them to continue with it and b) <br/>\nit was our only year without either a pregnant mom or a baby around.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe next year, we didn&#39;t use Sonlight because we couldn&#39;t afford it for all <br/>\nof the kids (last year&#39;s stuff had mostly been loaned from my sister and it <br/>\nwas just for the older two).  We hasd Alpha Omega math, Learning Language <br/>\nArts through Literature, planned on using the Sonlight booklists and the <br/>\nlibrary for history, and then just some various units and such for science.  <br/>\nBUT, we didn&#39;t really do much of that, the entire school year I was either <br/>\npregnant or there was a newborn baby needing lots of care.  We did get some <br/>\nthings accomplished, but it was usually after some arguing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year was pretty similar to the last one, only maybe a little more of a <br/>\nrelaxed curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is just now, at the thought of unschooling wanting all this <br/>\nA Beka and such and I just can&#39;t bring myself to spend $500 on something <br/>\nhe&#39;ll drop in a few weeks and not get much of anything out of it.  Even used, <br/>\nit would still cost atleast $250 or so which is a lot to spend for less than <br/>\na month of worksheets. Even spending $75 for a bunch of Spectrum type <br/>\nworkbooks is a lot for us when it&#39;s something we *know* will be dropped <br/>\nshortly and not have much benefit for the time used.  And just a few little <br/>\nstructured things *isn&#39;t* what he wants.  So, for right now,  Sandra&#39;s <br/>\nsuggestions have probably been the best ones for our situation.  My dd and I <br/>\nare going to a homeschool convention next month, so even saying that we&#39;ll <br/>\nhold off on buying it &#39;til then would probably be enough, because as I&#39;ve <br/>\nsaid before, he just talks about how he wants A Beka and doesn&#39;t do the stuff <br/>\nwe have right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make things any clearer?  I honestly don&#39;t want to get caught up in <br/>\nlisting all the educational things he does because that&#39;s been a major issue <br/>\nhere - me wanting the kids to do things &quot;to fill up it this lesson plan&quot; (we <br/>\nhad been filling in blank lesson plans with what we&#39;ve done school wise, <br/>\nafter it&#39;s been completed) and that would be a terrible thing for *us* to do, <br/>\nwhile trying to move closer to unschooling.  I am currently struggling with <br/>\nthat issue, actually - for example, when I was out, my 12 yod told me that <br/>\nher 8 and 6 y/o brothers had asked her to help her play a Family Math game <br/>\nand my first question was &quot;Did you put it on the lesson plan?&quot;  Her comment <br/>\nwas &quot;Mooommm... I thought you wanted to *unschool*, not just do different <br/>\nthings.&quot;<br/>\n           <br/>\nSandra<br/>\nHomeschooling Mom to Five<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":68475017,"authorName":"bianchifam7@aol.com","from":"bianchifam7@...","profile":"sandramom25","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] curriculum","postDate":"1020013083","msgId":36279,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUwLmFhNDBkNmUuMjlmZDg0MWJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":36278,"nextInTopic":36280,"prevInTime":36278,"nextInTime":36280,"topicId":36151,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/28/2002 8:34:38 AM Pacific Standard Time, ...
