We re thinking","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-10879109\">**Can anybody share new ideas for storing children&#39;s clothing?  Jackie <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like to use the closet and doesn&#39;t enjoy digging in the drawers.  We&#39;re <br/>\nthinking of trying cubes.  Any other ideas?**<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest son had a bed that was several feet off the floor. We used tall <br/>\nplastic tubs shoved under the bed to hold his clothes. Huge ones. Only half full. <br/>\nThen when he rummaged through them things didn&#39;t end up all over the floor. <br/>\n<br/>\nPat and Sarah have a cubical wall storage thingie from Ikea that holds their <br/>\nclothes. Most things are stacked in the cubes, but they have baskets that fit <br/>\nthe cubes for socks and underwear. They don&#39;t keep them super neatly stacked <br/>\nbut it&#39;s easy to redo when stuff starts falling out. We just recently switched <br/>\nover their room to all shelves, taking out the big dressers. There was too <br/>\nmuch wasted space with the dressers, and the drawers were constantly getting <br/>\nstuck from having too much shoved in them, or they were hanging out in the way. <br/>\nWith shelves they don&#39;t have to leave room for sliding in and out, and packing <br/>\nstuff in just looks messy but doesn&#39;t risk clothing damage. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also put a tall bookcase beside their bunk bed so they both have storage <br/>\nspace they can reach from their beds, for books and game boys and cd players <br/>\nand journals and whatever else one might want while winding down.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are hooks over the bedroom door for robes or whatever. I&#39;m thinking of <br/>\nputting a couple hooks up somewhere for stuff clean enough to wear again.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106054,"nextTopicId":106076}}
