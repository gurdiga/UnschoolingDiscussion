I can only imagine what <br/>\nit must have felt like.  Another thing (of the MANY) that makes me mad about <br/>\npublic schools is that they make kids be there and then they aren&#39;t even <br/>\nresponsible enough to at least make sure they are in a safe (mentally and <br/>\nphysically) situation.  Your experiences were some of the worst I&#39;ve ever <br/>\nheard but even in the so-called good schools, things go on which will scar <br/>\nsome kids for life.<br/>\n    My dad works at a middle school in a very affluent suburb of San Diego <br/>\nand he can&#39;t believe some of the things that go on.  Examples:  a Chinese <br/>\ngirl whose parents had her in a private school in Taiwan apparently thought <br/>\nit was unnecessary now with the &quot;good school&quot; available.  She has a habit of <br/>\npicking up pennies all the time and a group of popular boys noticed it and <br/>\nthought it was weird.  They started throwing pennies at her all the time, <br/>\nmaking fun of her, etc.  When my dad tried to reason with the boys about how <br/>\nmean it was, they joked about it and didn&#39;t stop.  When my dad talked to the <br/>\nvice principal about it, the V.P. said that he himself thought the girl was <br/>\nkind of weird.  End of conversation.  The girl is always alone, no friends.  <br/>\nIn addition to the bad effects this has on the girl, it sure isn&#39;t doing much <br/>\nto help those boys grow up to be the kind of people we need in our <br/>\ncommunities.<br/>\n    This is just one small example.  My dad has a new story every week or <br/>\nmore about this kind of stuff.  I was already pretty burned out on public <br/>\nschools when we moved back to Calfornia almost two years ago, but hearing my <br/>\ndad&#39;s stories in the trenches of the system has really solidified my feelings <br/>\nagainst them.  There are good people in the system, trying to help kids, but <br/>\nthe system itself is so flawed that the bad always seem to far outweigh the <br/>\ngood.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Lucy in Calif.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Joseph A. & Susan D.

The &quot;best&quot; school in a district still has pack-based peer<br/>\nsocialization, enforced curriculum, testing and grading, and a student body<br/>\nhopeless with the knowledge that they are literal prisoners, there is no way<br/>\nout for the vast majority of these kids until they&#39;ve served their time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is always really interesting to me to read about unschooled children who<br/>\ndecide, for one reason or another, to try out school.

It&#39;s the *choice* part, the freedom that almost every<br/>\nother schooled child lacks, that is unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s why I think you can&#39;t &quot;unschool everything except math&quot;. If you take<br/>\naway educational freedom, even &quot;just&quot; for one thing, it&#39;s gone. Force is<br/>\nforce.

I had terrible problems with peers<br/>\nwhich caused a number of traumas for me.  Including a boy (who had been<br/>\nheld back 3 grades) molesting me in elementary school.  I was beat up in<br/>\nsummer school on several occasions by boys, and had several really bad<br/>\nteachers in a row in middle school.  In general the atmosphere was of crowd<br/>\nand damage control.  If you were not a trouble maker but had academic<br/>\nproblems (like me) you were pretty much ignored.  I did well on tests and<br/>\nsome academic areas (things I enjoyed or excelled at) but got no help for<br/>\nmy problem areas.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI knew three girls in middle school (11-13) who were alcholholics and used<br/>\nto get drunk in the school yard at lunch.  Another girl I knew was pregnant<br/>\nby the end of 8th grade.  I went to a HS in the worst neighborhhod in my<br/>\ncity.  There were blood stains on the lockers because kids were stabbing<br/>\neach other in the hallways.  Going into the schoolyard during lunch was<br/>\nlike taking your life into your hands.  I had to get rides from friends out<br/>\nof the neighborhood in order to catch a city bus home from a safe<br/>\nneighborhood, as there were crack dealers with automatic weapons at the bus<br/>\nstops, and gangs riding the buses.  No lie.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool was a challenge to my survival on a daily basis.  My emotional<br/>\nsurvival and my physical survival.  Education was something that happened<br/>\nat home where I was safe, in my own time.  I remember very little that I<br/>\never &quot;learned&quot; in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4791,"nextTopicId":4794}}
