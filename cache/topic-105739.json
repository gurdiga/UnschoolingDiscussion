CLOSE walk to Old Town itself, lots of 200 year old buildings from <br/>\n&gt; territorial/cowboy days.<br/>\n&gt; 2. Close walk to Albuquerque Museum:  art, history, chain mail and  armor<br/>\n&gt; including full plate Horse armor from Conquistadores, and lots of  <br/>\n&gt; 16th/17th<br/>\n&gt; century weapons and helmets. <br/>\n&gt; 3. Close walk to National Atomic Museum (which used to be on Kirtland <br/>\n&gt; Airforce Base but was moved to Old Town near other museums, such as...<br/>\n&gt; 4. State Museum of Natural History:  Mostly dinosaurs and other  <br/>\n&gt; evolutionary<br/>\n&gt; stuff.  Not a good museum for creationists, which is fine with  me. <br/>\n&gt; Planetarium, observatory, Imax theatre, GREAT snack bar, other stuff,  <br/>\n&gt; next door to...<br/>\n&gt; 5. Explora Hands on Science Museum (before it came to this permanent <br/>\n&gt; building and was in a series of four temporary sites it was known as <br/>\n&gt; Explora <br/>\n&gt; Children&#39;s Museum), THE best museum.<br/>\n&gt; 6. Tiguex Park, a city park with lots of grass (big deal in New <br/>\n&gt; Mexico) and <br/>\n&gt; play equipment--mainly a big round obstacle course sort of thing on a <br/>\n&gt; padded <br/>\n&gt; surface, and outdoor chessboard tables.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; WAIT!

(Well others could too, I  <br/>\n&gt; suppose.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So if the conference can be where families can walk to great museums <br/>\n&gt; and a <br/>\n&gt; play area, and go and buy souvenirs in Old Town without ever needing <br/>\n&gt; to rent a <br/>\n&gt; car at all, THAT is a place worth having a conference.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No doubt.

OOOHHH! Yes! I would be *so* happy to have a chance to go back to <br/>\nAlbuquerque, where we lived for two years. And the thought of having the <br/>\nconference there at approx. the same time as the annual chili roasting <br/>\nseason sends my mouth to watering. We could not only see old friends and <br/>\nenjoy wonderful places we miss, but we could bring a garbage bag full of <br/>\nroasted green chilis home with us for the freezer!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, fwiw, there&#39;s nothing quite like a Blake&#39;s green chili <br/>\ncheeseburger, and the onion rings are to die for, if I recall.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen for all you Margharita lovers, Gardunos is always a fun place to <br/>\nhang for drinks, though it&#39;s more commercial than some of the really <br/>\ngood New Mexican food places.<br/>\n<br/>\nOooh, and everyone has to try the sopapillas!<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you tell I&#39;m a little excited?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (7), Julia (6), Sam (4.5)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;With our thoughts, we make the world.&quot; ~~Buddha</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Albuquerque (was a question about Arizona)","postDate":"1114784549","msgId":105739,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1LjQ0NWQ5OTk1LjJmYTM5ZDI1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":105741,"prevInTime":105738,"nextInTime":105740,"topicId":105739,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a lot to say about Albuquerque today and it could affect everyone here, but first this: -=-Tami, a recovering vegetarian, who just might be considered","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2090353149\">I have a lot to say about Albuquerque today and it could affect everyone  <br/>\nhere, but first this: <br/>\n <br/>\n-=-Tami, a recovering vegetarian, who just might be considered crazy for  <br/>\nmaking<br/>\na trans pacific, space available military flight with 3 children under  the<br/>\nage of 5, but will do it anyway just to spend time in NM and eat yet  another<br/>\nBlake’s Lotaburger!  So there!-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nCameron Lovejoy, Kelly & Ben&#39;s older son, was here in February.<br/>\nCameron doesn&#39;t really eat meat, and especially doesn&#39;t eat beef.<br/>\nCameron ate a Lotaburger at the old Blake&#39;s on the north side of Santa  Fe.<br/>\nI bet he won&#39;t hesitate to eat another one when he&#39;s here next time.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure when&#39;s the next time Cameron will be here, but I think he WILL  <br/>\nbe back, and it might be for a Live and Learn conference in Old Town, because  <br/>\nI&#39;ve put in to be in line for some upcoming year. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m looking at using the Sheraton Old Town.  In fact, if I can&#39;t get  that <br/>\nhotel, I don&#39;t want to do the conference.  There are half a dozen  reasons for <br/>\nthis.  <br/>\n1. CLOSE walk to Old Town itself, lots of 200 year old buildings from  <br/>\nterritorial/cowboy days.<br/>\n2. Close walk to Albuquerque Museum:  art, history, chain mail and  armor <br/>\nincluding full plate Horse armor from Conquistadores, and lots of  16th/17th <br/>\ncentury weapons and helmets.  <br/>\n3. Close walk to National Atomic Museum (which used to be on Kirtland  <br/>\nAirforce Base but was moved to Old Town near other museums, such as...<br/>\n4. State Museum of Natural History:  Mostly dinosaurs and other  evolutionary <br/>\nstuff.  Not a good museum for creationists, which is fine with  me.  <br/>\nPlanetarium, observatory, Imax theatre, GREAT snack bar, other stuff,  next door to...<br/>\n5. Explora Hands on Science Museum (before it came to this permanent  <br/>\nbuilding and was in a series of four temporary sites it was known as Explora  <br/>\nChildren&#39;s Museum), THE best museum.<br/>\n6. Tiguex Park, a city park with lots of grass (big deal in New Mexico) and  <br/>\nplay equipment--mainly a big round obstacle course sort of thing on a padded  <br/>\nsurface, and outdoor chessboard tables.<br/>\n <br/>\nWAIT!  I got to six and hadn&#39;t gotten to the last-but-not-least <br/>\nBLAKE&#39;S LOTABURGER right across the street from the hotel.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere&#39;s a Little Anita&#39;s to the south near Old Town (mid-priced New Mexican  <br/>\nrestaurant).<br/>\n <br/>\nCatholics could go mass at San Felipe church, a beautiful old mission-style  <br/>\nadobe church on the plaza in Old Town.  (Well others could too, I  suppose.)<br/>\n <br/>\nSo if the conference can be where families can walk to great museums and a  <br/>\nplay area, and go and buy souvenirs in Old Town without ever needing to rent a  <br/>\ncar at all, THAT is a place worth having a conference.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105774,"nextTopicId":105786}}
