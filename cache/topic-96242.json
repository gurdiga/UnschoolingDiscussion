I had a good chuckle at myself too.  We lived in our first house for 11 <br/>\nyears and coming out here has been quite a rollercoaster ride for me. I can <br/>\nremember a time when I used to think, &quot;if I could just move away and start over&quot;!  <br/>\nNow I think, &quot;boy how I miss the familiarity of home&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You see, I am a Christian and I smoke and have issues as well.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though (or maybe, because &lt;g&gt;) I was raised Catholic and went to a Catholic <br/>\nschool for 7 years, I must say that I question religion itself.  I am the type of person <br/>\nwho questions the system rather than to just accept it and I have learned of many <br/>\natrocities done in the name of &quot;religion&quot;.  That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t have faith, but just <br/>\nthat I can&#39;t say that I am Christian or otherwise with conviction.  I have a half sister <br/>\nwho is Jewish.  My &quot;religion&quot; would tell me that her faith is misguided and she will not <br/>\nbe accepted into heaven without accepting Jesus as her saviour.  Anyway, that being <br/>\nsaid, if you still think we might have a lot in common, you could email me off list and <br/>\nwe could chat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanx so much for your encouragement.  I really appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill trying to get it right, <br/>\nArlee</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":184700019,"authorName":"bkck8@aol.com","from":"bkck8@...","profile":"cassiekulas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Intro and reply for Arlee","postDate":"1089866378","msgId":96242,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgyLjEwOGRmNzVjLjJlMjc2NDhhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":96287,"prevInTime":96241,"nextInTime":96243,"topicId":96242,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, I think I have lurked long enough to post intro so here goes.
