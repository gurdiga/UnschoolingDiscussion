They want to drop any and all trappings of &quot;traditions of <br/>\nmen&quot; These are the same &quot;variety&quot; of Christian who want no candles, <br/>\nno bells, no stained glass, in their worship services. We go to a <br/>\npretty conservative church which outright rejects the &quot;traditional&quot; <br/>\ncommon cup in communion (among many other things such as the liturgy <br/>\nand the church calendar, etc). The reason being, the common cup is <br/>\nused in mainline denoms, which fundamentalists broke from 100 years <br/>\nago, because the mainliners were turning away from Scripture. The <br/>\nfundamentalists dropped EVERY element that was used by the main <br/>\ndenoms, because they wanted to make the break complete.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, they cut themselves away from an important anchor. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut this illustrates my point (and my peeve): They dropped the <br/>\nliturgy and the colorful altar decor and candles and such, not <br/>\nwanting anything to do with &quot;extra-biblical&quot; practices...but they <br/>\n(eventually?) went along with Christmas (nowhere commanded nor <br/>\nrecommended in the Bible) and Easter (okay, celebrations for the <br/>\nResurrection of Christ are mentioned in the New Testament, but dyeing <br/>\neggs? bunny rabbits? nope) And although evangelical churches still <br/>\ndon&#39;t do much with candles, they have taken to decorating their <br/>\nchurches colorfully...not with liturgical robes and altar cloths, but <br/>\nwith big felt banners and the like. <br/>\n<br/>\nIF a Bible-believing, truly obedient Christian church must drop &quot;the <br/>\ntraditions of men&quot; then DROP THEM. If we truly can&#39;t have anything <br/>\noutside of Biblically mandated practices, then better not do <br/>\nHallowe&#39;en...and then you&#39;d best drop Christmas as well as Easter <br/>\n(unless it is a simple, celebratory church service in honor of the <br/>\nResurrection) As you say, there are groups who do just this. They ARE <br/>\nfollowing through on their convictions when they don&#39;t do Christmas <br/>\nor other celebrations.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for the most part, my observation has been, Modern Christians of <br/>\nthe Fundamental Variety (outside the mainline denoms, mind you), <br/>\nEvangelicals if you will, consider Hallowe&#39;en to be an evil day. This <br/>\nis why you&#39;ll find basement &quot;Harvest Celebrations&quot; in various <br/>\nchurches. Can&#39;t do actual trick or treating, but you CAN go to the <br/>\nchurch festival...it&#39;s okay. THAT isn&#39;t Hallowe&#39;en. THAT is a Harvest <br/>\nCelebration.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What&#39;s being discussed here as Christian holidays and pagan <br/>\n </span></blockquote>holidays is <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; dealing just with England/English/American stuff.   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So, the Roman Catholic church didn&#39;t have Hallowe&#39;en in England?

(and can&#39;t <br/>\nremember the title. It is a scholarly, historian thing. Like, a PhD <br/>\nthesis or something. 500 pages + ) The Reformers wanted Christians to <br/>\nmake a clean break from R Catholicism; therefore, they stigmatized <br/>\nvarious Catholic practices by saying they came from paganism. <br/>\nAccording to this essay, archaeological data indicates that many of <br/>\nthese traditions didn&#39;t come into practice until after Christianity <br/>\ngot into an area. I&#39;ll try and remember specifics. The Yule Log was <br/>\none of the &quot;pagan practices&quot; debunked in the book. sheesh. can&#39;t <br/>\nremember, but Christian feast days coming from paganism or not, isn&#39;t <br/>\nmy main point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF Christian traditions come from paganism, my question just takes on <br/>\nmore weight. Why is Halloween evil (and it IS considered evil by many <br/>\nChristians. Take my word on that one. One of my best friends won&#39;t do <br/>\ntrick or treating, and another one completely ignores the day...) Why <br/>\nis All Hallow&#39;s Eve considered evil, and to be shunned, when <br/>\nChristmas and Easter are embraced? IF they come from pagan practices, <br/>\nwe should shun all of it. And in fact, the Reformers and their <br/>\nfollowers DID. Christmas was illegal in Puritan America. The <br/>\nbook &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; was written by the Puritan Daniel Defoe. He <br/>\nmakes a point of ignoring Dec. 25. by having the main character mark <br/>\noff days on his calendar and pointedly having Dec. 25 be just another <br/>\nday, nothing special.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Puritans tried to rename the days of the week, even. Sunday being <br/>\nnamed after the Sun, Monday after the Moon, and so forth. Can&#39;t have <br/>\nTHAT.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Hallowe&#39;en is evil, having come from paganism, then we must follow <br/>\nthrough on our logic and ban other Christian high holy days. But <br/>\ntoday&#39;s Christians don&#39;t follow through. They just consider <br/>\nHallowe&#39;en evil, but only certain parts of it, like trick or <br/>\ntreating. They allow the dressing up and the candy, but ban the trick <br/>\nor treating...or, just put it in the church basement or parking lot. <br/>\nAnd they never think twice about Christmas and Easter or the origin <br/>\nof any other tradition. <br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, HeidiC<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.

I called Fisher&#39;s school principal and told<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him we would be homeschooling, starting next week.  He&#39;s only got two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; half-days of school left, since this is parent-teacher conference week<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -- a chance to say good-bye.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now that the wheels are in motion, I&#39;m surprised at how many fears are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; surfacing for me.  I thought I felt very sure of this.  When we made<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the decision to do it *now*, Fisher was feeling overscheduled and very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much wanted to do it.  Now his thoughts are turning to his nice<br/>\n&gt; &gt; teachers and the things about school that he does like (recess, gym,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; music &lt;g&gt;), and the fact that people there like him.
