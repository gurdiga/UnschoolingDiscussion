This is all stuff that she likes to mix together just to see what happens.  She was enormously pleased with herself, for example, the day that she discovered that oil and colored water in her test tube would make something sort of like a wave bottle, or a lava lamp.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has a large supply of plastic test tubes and plastic pipettes and test tube stands and some recycled glass and plastic jars to mix and play in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn Lydia&#39;s science &quot;kit&quot; she has little baby food jars filled with things from the house and kitchen: sand, cornmeal, flour, cornstarch, baking soda, baking powder (fizzes in water, since it has a dry acid already in it), vinegar, antacids (she is past the stage of eating things like this), vitamin C, fruit fresh (a combination of dry acids), cocoa, sugar, salt, rock salt, oil in different colors (i.e. xvirgin olive oil is greenish, canola more yellow, etc.), rubbing alcohol, coarse glitter, fine glitter, borax solution, glue, tub tints (little dry pellets of color sold for use in playing in the bathtub), liquid watercolors, and probably some other things I&#39;m not thinking of.  Oh, yeah, some packets of dry cool-aid in different colors.  I&#39;m thinking of getting different colors of lamp oil, but haven&#39;t yet. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has little baby food jars filled with other things purchased from a kid&#39;s science supply house: fake snow (superabsorbent polymer), the kind of superabsorbant powder that they put into baby diapers,  a kind of superabsorbant powder that turns into little gelly &quot;crystals,&quot;  glow - in - the dark powder, magic sand (stays dry in water).   <br/>\n<br/>\nShe also has kid-sized plastic eye protectors that she wears for the dress-up pretend factor of being a chemist when she plays with her stuff.  I am planning to make her a kid-sized lab coat with her name on the pocket, but haven&#39;t done it yet. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, she just likes to play around and see what happens -- but here are a few combinations that definitely &quot;do&quot; something:  slime (borax solution and glue), fizzy bath bombs (oil, baking soda, and Kool-aid mixed together and formed into a small ball - fizzes and releases oil and sent when dropped into a bath); cornstarch and water turns into a weird substance that seems liquid until you push on it and then it seems solid.  If you put plain whole milk in a shallow saucer and drop little bits of watercolor or foodcolor in, the colors will mostly stay in place -- touch the center with a toothpick dipped in dishwashing liquid and the colors will instantly begin to mix and swirl.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI second someone&#39;s suggestion of the Kampf experiment of the week -- it&#39;s great. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe get some of our stuff from www.stevesspanglerscience.com.  Lydia sometimes likes to keep her concotions in test tubes, rather than rinsing them out to start over, so we get them in bulk - they&#39;re about 40cents each, when you buy them 120 at at time. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope some of this is helpful.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Laura Johnson <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, September 20, 2004 7:35 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] making a chemistry kit<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ****plastic test tubes and child-friendly chemicals to mix in them <br/>\n  My five year old has expressed an interest in a chemistry kit that he could experiment by himself.

He e-mails you  one <br/>\nevery Monday. His subscription info is at the bottom of every e-mail.<br/>\n <br/>\nHere&#39;s his post for this week:<br/>\n <br/>\nRobert Krampf&#39;s Experiment of the  Week<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis  Week&#39;s Experiment - #393 - Frozen Bowl<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings from my home at the  beach.   My surgery went wonderfully, and I am <br/>\nquickly  recovering.   Even with no medication, I am not having any acid  <br/>\nreflux.   I am taking walks on the beach to regain my strength,  and eating <br/>\nlots of <br/>\nvery small, soft meals as I wait for my stomach to  recover.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThis week&#39;s experiment is a result of those small  meals.   Searching for <br/>\nvariety and taste, I dug out the snow cone  machine.   To prepare for my <br/>\nrecovery <br/>\ntime, I bought some paper  bowls to eat from; in case I did not feel well <br/>\nenough <br/>\nto wash  dishes.   I grated the ice into a paper bowl and poured on some of  <br/>\nthe sweet flavored syrup.   The phone rang, so I placed the bowl  on the <br/>\ncounter. <br/>\nWhen I finished with the call, the bowl was frozen to  the counter top.   <br/>\nWhy?   To find out, you will  need:<br/>\n<br/>\n2 or more paper bowls<br/>\ncrushed ice<br/>\nsalt<br/>\n<br/>\nThe paper bowl  has a flat bottom, so it is directly in contact with the <br/>\ntable  <br/>\ntop.   It is also thin, which lets heat pass through fairly  quickly, and the <br/>\npaper lets a tiny bit of water soak through as  well.   Put   crushed ice <br/>\ninto <br/>\ntwo bowls.    Place one on the table.   Add about 4 spoons of salt to the <br/>\nother  <br/>\nand give it a quick stir.   Place it on the table beside the  first.   If you <br/>\nare not using paper bowls, put a drop or two of  water on the table <br/>\nunderneath <br/>\neach bowl.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow wait for two or three  minutes.   Then try to move each bowl.   The bowl <br/>\nwhich  only contains ice will move easily, but the bowl with ice and salt <br/>\nshould <br/>\nbe  frozen to the table.   Why?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe salt lowers the freezing point  of the ice.   The part of the ice that is <br/>\nin contact with the salt  will change from solid ice into liquid water.   The <br/>\nsalt is not  melting the ice by adding heat.   You are just changing the <br/>\npoint  <br/>\nwhere it will remain a solid.   <br/>\n<br/>\nTo make the change from  solid to liquid, the water needs energy.   As the <br/>\nice <br/>\nmelts, it  pulls heat energy from its surroundings, making the liquid water <br/>\neven  colder.   You now have liquid water which is colder than water&#39;s  <br/>\nnormal <br/>\nfreezing point.   It pulls heat energy from the air, from  the bowl, from the <br/>\ntable, and from any water that is between the bowl and  the table.   That <br/>\nwater <br/>\ndoes not contain salt, so it will freeze  at the normal freezing point, <br/>\nfreezing <br/>\nthe bowl to the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is  why you add salt to the ice in a home ice cream freezer.   The salt  <br/>\ngives you water cooled beyond its normal freezing point.   The  cools the ice <br/>\ncream mixture enough to cause it to freeze.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut  wait!   I did not add any salt to my snow cone.   I added  sugar syrup.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSugar will also lower the freezing point of ice,  but not as much as salt.   <br/>\nThat is why we used salt for our  experiment.   You can try it again with <br/>\nsugar <br/>\nor sugar  syrup.   You will probably not get results that are as dramatic, <br/>\nbut  <br/>\nthey will taste much better.   I am particularly fond of the lime  flavored <br/>\nsyrup, but the grape is good too.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a wonder filled  week.   <br/>\n<br/>\n****************************************<br/>\nThis  weekly e-mail list is free from charge.

What are some safe things I could give him that he could experiment with?  He wants to just mix stuff together to see what happens.  We&#39;ve done the baking soda thing, any other ideas?  I want to give him some things that would have a neat reaction, but I never took chemistry.<br/>\nLaura J<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99719,"nextTopicId":99711}}
