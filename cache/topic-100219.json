Kill everything you meet. Backstab your friends and <br/>\nsteal their stuff. Grab the treasure and run.<br/>\nAdmit it. You love it.<br/>\nThis award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence <br/>\nof the dungeon experience . . . with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. <br/>\nYou and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what <br/>\nmagic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff <br/>\nof Napalm . . . or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by <br/>\nslaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the <br/>\nPlutonium Dragon . . .<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can <br/>\nreduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they&#39;re laughing, you can <br/>\nsteal their stuff.<br/>\nMunchkin won the Origins award for Best Traditional Card Game of 2001!<br/>\n168 cards, rules sheet, and sturdy set-up box  Suggested Retail Price: $24.95 <br/>\nStock #1408  ISBN 1-55634-473-2<br/>\nAvailable Now - click here to order!<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n*   Munchkin - The original card game. <br/>\n*   Munchkin 2 - Unnatural Axe - 112 more hilarious cards from the creators <br/>\nof Munchkin! <br/>\n*   Munchkin 3 - Clerical Errors - Another expansion for your Munchkin deck! <br/>\n*   Munchkin 3.5 - Clerical Errata  - Oops, we weren&#39;t supposed to mention <br/>\nthat. <br/>\n<br/>\n*   Star Munchkin - Kill the monsters, steal the treasure, and stab your <br/>\nbuddy . . . in space! <br/>\n*   Star Munchkin 2 - The Clown Wars brings the epic saga of The Clown Wars <br/>\nto life, except with better acting . . . <br/>\n<br/>\n*   Munchkin Fu - Chop-socky monster-whacking action straight from Hong <br/>\nKong&#39;s worst films! <br/>\n*   Munchkin Bites! - The Munchkins are now vampires . . . and werewolves . . <br/>\n. <br/>\n*   Munchkin Blender - An expansion pack for use with any of the Munchkin <br/>\ncard games - preferably two or more of them. <br/>\n*   Munchkin Miniatures will add that third dimension to your character . . . <br/>\nor use them in an RPG to warn everyone just what they&#39;re up against! <br/>\n*   Track those level increases in style with the Munchkin Level Counter! <br/>\n*   Want to design your own monsters, curses, or items?
