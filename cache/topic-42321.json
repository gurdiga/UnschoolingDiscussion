Its the same advice that parents of a 14 yo might get here. <br/>\nWe don&#39;t care how old your kids are  -  the principles of unschooling are the <br/>\nsame. Support your kids interests, help them discover their passions, provide <br/>\nthem with an enriched environment, live a good life, enjoy yourselves, be <br/>\ncurious, enjoy learning, work hard, make friends, laugh a lot, sing and play.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42274,"nextTopicId":42343}}
