I think I <br/>\n&gt; would say something like &quot;Do you know about homeschooling?  We really love <br/>\n&gt; it. &quot;  Then follow up with more info if there was any interest.  In a way <br/>\n&gt; that reassures the parent that there are several other options without <br/>\n&gt; finding fault with the parent -- and probably just making them defensive <br/>\n&gt; anyway.  I would try to offer hope and encouragement without a pinch of <br/>\n&gt; judgement and superiority.  Some folks think they have found the answer -- <br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s terrific.  But it&#39;s not the answer for everyone.  The only &quot;answer&quot; <br/>\n&gt; for everyone, imo, is to figure it out for yourself, one situation, one <br/>\n&gt; family, one child at a time.  The only &quot;movement&quot; I hope to see developing <br/>\n&gt; is <br/>\n&gt; one where every parent knows what all their choices are and feels confident <br/>\n&gt; enough to make a conscious decision.

Her <br/>\nparents, whom I like and respect very much, were never really willing to <br/>\nconsider homeschooling...until this summer. We were talking and they said <br/>\nthey&#39;d be open to it. Ultimately Emily decided she&#39;d miss too much her last <br/>\ncouple of years of friends and acquaintances, but she really appreciated <br/>\nmaking that decision knowing she had options.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13491,"nextTopicId":25315}}
