And I&#39;ve accepted gifts of texts from my teacher family members<br/>\nwho saved the books from the garbage dumpster.  We haven&#39;t had any<br/>\nopportunity to use them yet.  In fact, I haven&#39;t even shown them to ds yet,<br/>\nbut I plan to-only to let him know they exist.  I don&#39;t see these texts as<br/>\nan end all, but as a jumping off point.  Leave the book out, maybe ds will<br/>\nbrowse through it.  Maybe he&#39;ll see something of interest and ask me about.<br/>\nMaybe he&#39;ll want to learn more, and look for more info on it in other books.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also use the texts to give me ideas-to remind me what sorts of subjects<br/>\nmay (I said may-as is in &quot;maybe&quot;!) be appropriate for ds&#39;s current learning<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, lastly, I&#39;m a book fiend. If it&#39;s got binding, and pages (doesn&#39;t even<br/>\nhave to have a cover! ;-) then I&#39;m going to gape at it. I LOVE books, even<br/>\npoorly written ones.  (In that case, I LOVE complaining about how poorly<br/>\nwritten they are! This morning we were shifting books in our bookshelves to<br/>\nmake space and dh said to me about an author-I forget which one- &quot;Sheesh,<br/>\nyou sure keep a lot of this author&#39;s books around for hating her writing so<br/>\nmuch.&quot; lol!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and lastly for real-I always keep in mind that *I&#39;m* the one with the<br/>\nbook addiction, not ds (although he&#39;s picking up on my affliction). I don&#39;t<br/>\nreally buy texts for him.  He&#39;s just my excuse. :-) I hope he&#39;ll take an<br/>\ninterest in them, just as I&#39;d hope he&#39;d take an interest in anything I enjoy<br/>\ndoing, but I don&#39;t force him. (Not that I haven&#39;t tried in the past.  Boy<br/>\ndid I learn my lesson!
