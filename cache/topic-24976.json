I agree that there is the possibility of<br/>\ndoing too much.  I think there is a fine line between allowing your child<br/>\nautonomy over his/her education and allowing your child autonomy over<br/>\nyou.  Or maybe it is a wide grey area, with each child falling at a<br/>\ndifferent place.  I do think that some children can be left completely<br/>\nalone in a house full of really cool stuff and they will not use any of<br/>\nit and others will make the most of it.  Most of them will fall in<br/>\nbetween somewhere.  But ultimately, if you love and respect your kids you<br/>\nwill find that midpoint that gives them control over themselves without<br/>\nhaving control over you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~If electricity comes from electrons...does that mean that morality<br/>\ncomes from morons?~~~~<br/>\nI sent my Soul through the Invisible,<br/>\n        Some letter of that After-life to spell;<br/>\nAnd by and by my Soul returned to me,<br/>\n        And answered, &quot;I Myself am Heaven and Hell.&quot;  --  The Rubaiyat</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"-_XHVTGEdCWzwhbwIFEIw5KKG-RlBTJnWLR8MK0QhzvACi8cOSL3EoV9eWDw1wvbn2KvSKASNmJ_","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] The TV Issue","postDate":"1000114303","msgId":24976,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI4LjFiMTE2MGI1LjI4Y2RlMjdmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":24992,"prevInTime":24975,"nextInTime":24977,"topicId":24976,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1161049808\">&lt;&lt;    I don&#39;t really agree with some of your feelings that a <br/>\nunschooling moms role is to constantly involve her children in <br/>\ncountless excursions and fun activities.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t need to be constant or countless, but the other end of that scale <br/>\nis a mom who hasn&#39;t taken her kids anywhere for two months and yet is grumpy <br/>\nthat unschooling isn&#39;t working, or that her kids are watching TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing the world as your classroom doesn&#39;t mean leaving the kids stuck at home <br/>\nwithout any outside exposure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere in between is a good balance point for each family.
