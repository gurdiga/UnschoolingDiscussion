Apples need a <br/>\ndifferent climate, different soil, different amounts of water, different <br/>\nfertilizer...  Not saying that schooled kids need different things than unschooled <br/>\nkids, just that we approach learning in such a way as it is natural and not <br/>\ndivided into subjects and hours and requirements at this or that age level. So if <br/>\nyou ask if my daughter Moly at the age of nine, almost ten, knows her <br/>\nmultiplication tables like her schooled peers, then no. But she does multiplication <br/>\nand division in her head that wasn&#39;t &quot;taught&quot; in the teacher/book/student sense. <br/>\nAnd she doesn&#39;t call what she does multiplication or division, it is just s<br/>\nomething she does. OTOH, if I were to put a worksheet of math problems in front <br/>\nof her, she probably wouldn&#39;t be able to do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are asking if unschooled kids do science or history like schooled <br/>\nkids, then the answer is again no. If you have been reading all the books and get <br/>\nthe impression that after a few months of deschooling (if your kids have been <br/>\nin school) your kids will start asking for a history book or a science book, <br/>\nthen probably not. What does happen is that a child develops an interest in a <br/>\nmovie or a game and wants to learn more about the time period. So you would <br/>\nthen try to provide interesting books and movies and other things to help your <br/>\nchild. I&#39;m going to use the movie and TV program Stargate as an example. A child <br/>\nmight like to watch the program and want to learn about ancient Egypt, or <br/>\nspace technology, or the AirForce, or aliens, or weapons and warfare. Any of <br/>\nthose things would &quot;teach&quot; a child history, math, science, or reading, but again, <br/>\nnot divided into those subjects. A child wouldn&#39;t see it that he was learning <br/>\nhistory as a subject. A child would see that he was learning about what <br/>\ninterests him. Or they might see a TV program about lizards and amphibians and think <br/>\nmud puppies look cool and want to learn more about them. In either situation, <br/>\nyou wouldn&#39;t hand a nine year old a third or fourth grade history or science <br/>\nbook to answer those questions. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are asking about reading, then we all have a wide variety of parents <br/>\nhere with children who all have read a different times in their lives. Some <br/>\ndidn&#39;t start until they were nine, ten, eleven, or twelve. Some started earlier. <br/>\nAll by the time they are teens read as well as the next. Some kids are like my <br/>\nMoly who read all the time, some are like Jack who read as little as possible <br/>\nand only if it is very interesting and has to do with what ever he is doing <br/>\nat that point. The rest fall everywhere in between. So in that aspect <br/>\nunschooled kids are just like schooled kids in their reading tastes, but unschooled <br/>\nkids aren&#39;t forced or made to feel bad about being late readers or that reading <br/>\nisn&#39;t their thing. And honestly we shouldn&#39;t even use the term late reader. The <br/>\nchild is just reading on his or her own time and terms, not late or early. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps! :o)<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139187074,"authorName":"Julie Solich","from":"&quot;Julie Solich&quot; &lt;mjsolich@...&gt;","profile":"foxymophandlemama32","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: subjects","postDate":"1067926957","msgId":83766,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTQwMWMzYTI5YyQwYjNkYzAyMCQ1ZjYyMWFkM0BtYXJrPg==","referencesHeader":"PDYxLjM3M2VhMzAwLjJjZDg5YTFkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":83764,"nextInTopic":83818,"prevInTime":83765,"nextInTime":83767,"topicId":83732,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... do  with that is too limiting.
