Deirdre, you could also point out to your husband that many great<br/>\nscholarly and religious traditions have been passed down through the ages<br/>\nvia stories, not to mention genealogies, epic poems of many cultures, and<br/>\noral history. Someone posted the other day about the value of reading and<br/>\nthe Bushmen of the Kalahari. I accidentally lost that post before I could<br/>\nrespond, but she was absolutely right! The history of the written and<br/>\nprinted word is relatively brief - and the history of large numbers of<br/>\npeople having access to written matter (either physical access to it, or<br/>\neven possessing the ability to read) is even shorter and more geographically<br/>\nconfined. The days of the Renaissance man are rapidly passing us by. The<br/>\nmuch-hyped &quot;information age&quot; is here, and none of us can hope to know it<br/>\nall. I think the real risk these days is in suffering from an information<br/>\noverload without having enough time for contemplation of what we know. I&#39;d<br/>\ntell your husband that it&#39;s not the number of facts you know that matters,<br/>\nit&#39;s how you understand them. And if stories are the way to greater<br/>\nunderstanding for you, then that is fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I meant to reply to the Bushmen post was that I started reading &quot;In<br/>\nTheir Own Way&quot; by Thomas Armstrong and he had some very interesting things<br/>\nto say about multiple intelligences. There is clearly an intersection<br/>\nbetween innate learning preferences and abilities, culture, and the child&#39;s<br/>\nindividual environment. Parents all over the world prepare their children to<br/>\nbe successful (as in well-adapted) members of their own cultures. I think<br/>\nyou can help a child develop the coping skills they&#39;ll need in a particular<br/>\nenvironment without destroying their individuality. Literacy may not say<br/>\nanything about a person&#39;s intelligence, but there is no question that it is<br/>\nan important skill to have if you are living in a modern, industrialized<br/>\nsociety.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\nLaura Simeon<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thisbe@...\">thisbe@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kjsl.com/~thisbe/\">http://www.kjsl.com/~thisbe/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Cory and Amy Nelson","from":"Cory and Amy Nelson &lt;amynelson3@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"LwvJiPT-yDdz3oxbJd5ZNBCaeJS9YIEc-W-9292aCNJNgqVccEv8dw3lfGFAFWmwwpvB5TZnOQIAoct9xULWSgPd6RT2SOBV-mZsAzytxv4","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] What are the Value of Stories? was: Not reading books","postDate":"976293831","msgId":14437,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI2NTY2QkU3LkVENyVhbXluZWxzb24zQGhvbWUuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDAxMjA4MDQzNS5lQjg0WjBaODYyMjJAbWFpbC5ueWN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":14430,"nextInTopic":14439,"prevInTime":14436,"nextInTime":14438,"topicId":14386,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Deirdre- I feel exactly the same way about stories and reading fiction.

I don&#39;t want to waste my<br/>\ntime on something I may not like. :-)<br/>\nI have recenlty started a reading group for older home-ed kids (10s and up)<br/>\naround here. There are only two who come (and one of them is my daughter)<br/>\nbut even in the few weeks we have been discussing books I have been amazed.<br/>\nBecause it is a small group, because there is no agenda, ie questions to<br/>\nthink about, the discussions are really cool.  We begin to discuss a theme<br/>\nor situation in the book and they are making connections with tv shows, or<br/>\nthings that have happened to them or other books. For example when we read A<br/>\nWizard of Earthsea they compared Ged and the shadow to an episode of Deep<br/>\nspace Nine where different aspects of a character were embodied in the other<br/>\ncharacters.  They compared Ogion the old wizard to Obi Wan in Star WArs.<br/>\nThey compared one character who was a bit of a bully with a child that we<br/>\nall know and tried to figure out why he acts the way he acts. So when you<br/>\nsay<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; A few of the arguments I&#39;ve given him are that fiction inspires me,<br/>\n&gt; that it opens up my eyes to new worlds, new perspectives, new<br/>\n&gt; ideas, that it relaxes me and gives me a little vacation from my<br/>\n&gt; every day world.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would say you are spot on.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there are also different ways of reading stories.  Entertainment is a<br/>\nbiggy and there is no problem with that. But we can also read and then use<br/>\nother parts of our brain to figure things out. We have to make connections<br/>\nand sense ourselves when we read fiction.  sometimes when we read<br/>\nnon-fiction, it is all spelled out for us and there is no creative thinking<br/>\nneeded. But then there  is non-fiction that again encourages us to figure<br/>\nthings out and make connections so that our understandin goes deeper.<br/>\nPerhaps it is not the difference between the type of reading material that<br/>\nis so imprtant but out different intentions in what we get from the<br/>\nmaterial. It sounds like you and your husband generally have similar goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis answer is that he gets some of the same<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; results from non-fiction while learning much more and can get the<br/>\n&gt; rest of the results in far less time by watching the occasional movie.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This argument a big deal because we each do what we want to do,<br/>\n&gt; but I am bringing this up because I do see his point to some extent.<br/>\n&gt; I am wondering what some of your answers would be to the<br/>\n&gt; question &quot;what are the value of stories?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course another question would be &quot;Why do stories have to have an<br/>\nidentifyable value?&quot; If we decide on a value, does that mean people who read<br/>\nfor different reasons are wrong?

WIEGAND<br/>\n<br/>\n   At the beginning of a course I teach to all first-semester<br/>\n  students at the University of Wisconsin at Madison&#39;s School of<br/>\n  Library and Information Studies, I run through a litany of<br/>\n  statistics: There are more public libraries in the United<br/>\n  States than McDonald&#39;s restaurants. Americans make 3.5 billion<br/>\n  visits to school, public, and college or university libraries<br/>\n  every year -- three times more than visits to the movies.<br/>\n  Children and young adults go to school libraries 1.7 billion<br/>\n  times during the school year -- two times more visits than to<br/>\n  state and national parks.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When Americans go to the library, I tell my students, they are<br/>\n  usually looking for stories to read. They want material that<br/>\n  inspires them or affirms their identities, written in the<br/>\n  narrative form that years of reading have made familiar --<br/>\n  from the latest Danielle Steel novel or Harry Potter and the<br/>\n  Goblet of Fire, to nonfiction like Mitch Albom&#39;s Tuesdays With<br/>\n  Morrie, Frank McCourt&#39;s Angela&#39;s Ashes, or Tom Brokaw&#39;s The<br/>\n  Greatest Generation. A 1998 survey by the American Library<br/>\n  Association showed that two-thirds of Americans use a public<br/>\n  library at least once per year, and of that number 80 percent<br/>\n  (about 145 million people) go there to check out a book.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Fortunately, scholars in the humanities have been studying the<br/>\n  subject of reading stories for the past 25 years, from a<br/>\n  variety of perspectives -- including literacy studies,<br/>\n  reader-response theory, ethnographies of reading, the social<br/>\n  history of print, and cultural studies, which examines how<br/>\n  people &quot;read&quot; nonprint material like the videos and compact<br/>\n  disks that libraries also circulate by the millions. Those<br/>\n  scholars analyze who reads what stories, and why, by focusing<br/>\n  on the complex ways that readers from various cultures use<br/>\n  what they read in their daily lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Statistics clearly demonstrate that many people rely on<br/>\n  libraries for their stories, and generally, librarians know<br/>\n  what gets checked out. Unfortunately, librarians have little<br/>\n  knowledge of why people read what they do. As a result, they<br/>\n  lack a deeper understanding of how libraries already serve<br/>\n  readers, and they miss evidence that they could use to<br/>\n  convince state legislatures and other sources of financial<br/>\n  support that spending money on stories is important. They also<br/>\n  are often unable to help patrons find just the right story to<br/>\n  read, nor do they develop enough programs -- book clubs, for<br/>\n  example -- to connect readers to one another.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Part of the blame for that tremendous professional oversight<br/>\n  belongs to library and information-science programs, which<br/>\n  have generally ignored the literature on reading and -- except<br/>\n  for children&#39;s literature -- traditionally undervalued the<br/>\n  reading of stories.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As a historian, I think I understand how that oversight<br/>\n  evolved. Michel Foucault argued that centuries ago, the new<br/>\n  order that we now call modernity separated people&#39;s experience<br/>\n  of daily life into work and leisure. Over time, we came to<br/>\n  think of information that answers questions related to work,<br/>\n  or helps people become informed citizens or intelligent<br/>\n  consumers, as especially important; we labeled it &quot;useful<br/>\n  knowledge.&quot; In a library, people usually get that kind of<br/>\n  information at the reference desk, with the help of a<br/>\n  librarian. We consider reading stories, however, an activity<br/>\n  of leisure, and we underestimate the value of the information<br/>\n  that stories contain.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Evidence of that bifurcated thinking abounds in U.S. library<br/>\n  history. For example, the Public Library Inquiry of 1949,<br/>\n  supported by the Carnegie Corporation, concluded that public<br/>\n  libraries ought to minimize their practice of supplying the<br/>\n  popular reading that nearly three-quarters of their users<br/>\n  desired, and concentrate instead on a smaller but more<br/>\n  influential combination of &quot;serious&quot; readers, community<br/>\n  leaders, and students of adult education who used public<br/>\n  libraries to obtain useful knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That same kind of thinking is evident in library schools.<br/>\n  Today, most educators in library and information-science<br/>\n  programs are convinced that their profession&#39;s chief<br/>\n  responsibility is to give patrons access to useful knowledge.<br/>\n  Further, because the curricula are increasingly driven by the<br/>\n  technologies that do such a good job of manipulating that kind<br/>\n  of information, many professors seem to feel that if a<br/>\n  computer isn&#39;t involved somehow, the material in question<br/>\n  can&#39;t be information.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In library schools, basic texts that students must read for<br/>\n  core courses include little or no coverage of the recent<br/>\n  literature on reading. Doctoral students typically investigate<br/>\n  topics connected to new technologies. Advertisements for new<br/>\n  professors almost always emphasize teaching skills and<br/>\n  research expertise in information technologies; they almost<br/>\n  never mention the need to develop an understanding of the<br/>\n  information that millions of Americans find in the stories<br/>\n  they get from their libraries. Some library schools have<br/>\n  eliminated story-centered teaching positions and courses --<br/>\n  like children&#39;s librarianship.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Even critics of current thinking can&#39;t seem to venture outside<br/>\n  the box. For example, The Chronicle published nine letters to<br/>\n  the editor in its May 12 issue that sought to debunk or<br/>\n  clarify an April 7 article titled &quot;In Revamped Library<br/>\n  Schools, Information Trumps Books.&quot; None of the letters cited<br/>\n  the library&#39;s primary role as a reading institution. Instead,<br/>\n  what united the correspondents was their belief that libraries<br/>\n  are more than just books.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The narrow vision of library professionals was made<br/>\n  particularly obvious in 1996, when the Benton Foundation<br/>\n  issued preliminary findings of a study on what the public<br/>\n  thought of leading librarians&#39; visions of the future for<br/>\n  libraries. The investigators reported what they had found to<br/>\n  representatives of the 18 institutions that had commissioned<br/>\n  the study, which included four library schools.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Among the findings was that a focus group of suburban<br/>\n  public-library users had collectively identified as their top<br/>\n  two public-library services &quot;providing reading hours and other<br/>\n  programs for children&quot; and buying enough popular titles so<br/>\n  that patrons could, as one member of the focus group put it,<br/>\n  &quot;get the book that everybody is reading right now.&quot; The<br/>\n  investigators concluded that the public did not &quot;understand<br/>\n  what goes on in the library other than taking out books.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  As far as I can tell, neither the investigators nor the people<br/>\n  they reported to connected the study&#39;s findings to the<br/>\n  literature on reading. Referring to the work of scholars like<br/>\n  Janice A. Radway on romance novels, George N. Dove on<br/>\n  detective stories, Henry Jenkins on science fiction, or<br/>\n  Matthew Pustz on comic books might have made it clear that<br/>\n  members of the public understand that taking out books is the<br/>\n  most important activity that happens in the library. Instead,<br/>\n  the library leaders planned to change the public&#39;s perception<br/>\n  of libraries.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I hope that no one reading this essay concludes that I am<br/>\n  against technology. Not at all. Professional librarians -- and<br/>\n  the programs that educate them -- certainly have to tap the<br/>\n  potential of information technologies in serving their<br/>\n  patrons. But the contrast between the statistics on what<br/>\n  Americans do in libraries and the near-total absence of<br/>\n  attention to reading in library schools across the country<br/>\n  shows that we aren&#39;t teaching future librarians nearly enough<br/>\n  about the activity that is most central to librarianship.<br/>\n  Rather than restricting the definition of information to what<br/>\n  technology can provide, we should greatly expand the focus of<br/>\n  library schools.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In the next year, nearly 5,000 new graduates of programs<br/>\n  accredited by the American Library Association will get jobs<br/>\n  at public, school, and academic libraries whose patrons use<br/>\n  them chiefly to get reading material. The vast majority of the<br/>\n  new librarians will eventually learn who reads what stories,<br/>\n  but they won&#39;t understand why, in spite of the abundant<br/>\n  literature that addresses that question. Worse yet, they will<br/>\n  have been schooled to think that understanding why millions of<br/>\n  their patrons read stories is none of their professional<br/>\n  business. What a shame.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Wayne A. Wiegand is a professor at the School of Library and<br/>\n  Information Studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison<br/>\n  and coeditor, with James P.

None of them have ever<br/>\npicked up a book and read it. They have no books or newspapers in their<br/>\nhouses. I sincerely doubt that most of them are able to read at a 4th or 5th<br/>\ngrade level (despite having passed those grades). DH himself, though a<br/>\nbrilliant man and successful businessman, is barely literate (not able to<br/>\nwrite a coherent and grammatically correct sentence to save his life, cannot<br/>\nspell even basic words) and never had read a book cover-to-cover before<br/>\nmeeting me. Of course, he managed to get passed from grade to grade and<br/>\ngraduate high school though.<br/>\n<br/>\nSadly, I would bet that the statistic of 60% of Americans being like this is<br/>\npretty accurate. These people I am talking about are not poverty-ridden in a<br/>\nghetto. They have access to fine schools, libraries, etc. They have<br/>\ndisposable income. They are average Americans. They just aren&#39;t literate (by<br/>\nwhich I mean they can read by sounding out words, but they can&#39;t read for<br/>\nmeaning and comprehension, and cannot write at a level to be easily<br/>\nunderstood).<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n  -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;What if there was no gravity, but we all held on<br/>\nto something really tight??&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) who says &quot;Odwalla!&quot; (her favorite treat at the store)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14426,"nextTopicId":14419}}
