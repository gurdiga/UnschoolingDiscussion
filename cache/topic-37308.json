The kids<br/>\nare often cajoled, teased and threatened into doing things, all sorts of<br/>\nthings, they don&#39;t feel comfortable with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that straying outside the comfort zone in a loving atmosphere<br/>\ncan be a good thing.  Zach (8) is a nervous, worrying kind of kid.  He was<br/>\nintroduced to Jurassic Park at a friend&#39;s house and had nightmares, scared<br/>\nto go upstairs by himself, etc..  He then pestered and pestered to rent<br/>\nJurassic Park III.  I told him I didn&#39;t think it was a good idea, remember<br/>\nhow scared you got , etc., etc..  Finally rented it for him.  He spent most<br/>\nof the movie hiding behind his hands.  Again , lots of fears but much less<br/>\nintense.  Then Zach saw Jurassic Park video at the library.  Pester, pester<br/>\nto get the movie.  OK, says I.  He has watched it pretty much non-stop for 2<br/>\ndays.  No longer scared, asking lots of questions about dinosaurs, their<br/>\nvisual systems, herbivores vs. carnivores, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nBy trusting him to step outside of where he and I both felt comfortable,<br/>\nZach was able to conquer his fears and take control.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37307,"nextTopicId":37257}}
