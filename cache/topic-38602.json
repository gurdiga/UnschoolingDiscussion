I went to college for a few years then I met my <br/>\nhusband and was married at 19 and had Moly at 20. <br/>\nTalking with my sister and brother, who are much younger than I am, they say <br/>\nme leaving must have been a wake up call to our father, because he never hit <br/>\nthem ever, like he did me for years. I bore the brunt of the abuse, and there <br/>\nwas no excuse for the abuse like alcoholism. I am not saying alcoholism is an <br/>\nexcuse for abuse, I am just saying he wasn&#39;t an alcoholic, so that isn&#39;t <br/>\nwhere the abuse came from.

What dire consequences will happen if it doesn&#39;t?<br/>\nYou *want* it to be done so that the system you&#39;ve come up with to maintain<br/>\n*your* standards can operate. It&#39;s your *choice* to keep the house at that<br/>\nstandard. No one will arrest you if your house falls below a certain<br/>\nstandard. (Provided it&#39;s healthy of course!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t need to eat 3 meals a day. We don&#39;t need to have dinner on the<br/>\ntable at 6. We don&#39;t need to have a set bed time. We don&#39;t need to keep the<br/>\nhouse to a certain standard of tidiness. We don&#39;t have to make sure the kids<br/>\ngo to school and do their homework. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean let chaos reign ;-) It means learning to see that almost<br/>\neverything we do is a choice rather than a &quot;have to&quot; or &quot;need to&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of problems arise from confusing the solution with the problem. Such as<br/>\nassuming that having difficulties getting the kids to school and getting<br/>\ntheir homework done is the problem. But the real problem -- to which school<br/>\nis one (albeit poor ;-) solution -- is providing an environment so the kids<br/>\ncan learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch as assuming that having difficulties making dinner in the evening when<br/>\nthe kids are tired and hungry is the problem. It isn&#39;t. The real problem is<br/>\nthat people get hungry and need food. That *doesn&#39;t* mean the only solution<br/>\nis making &quot;a meal&quot; for the whole family to eat together at 6. It just means<br/>\npeople need access to food when they&#39;re hungry. Which is a problem with far<br/>\nmore potential solutions than the &quot;problem&quot; of making dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s liberating to realize that we don&#39;t have to clean the living room. We<br/>\ncan look at it as a gift *we* want to give to the family. That sounds like a<br/>\n50&#39;s Suzy Homemaker sentiment ;-) But the Suzy Homemaker mind set assumes<br/>\nthat the rest of the family wants a certain standard and expects mom to<br/>\nmaintain it. If that&#39;s true, then there are way deeper problems involved<br/>\nthan getting the house clean! And we don&#39;t have to give them a gift of a<br/>\ntidy house if doesn&#39;t feel like a gift. We could give them a meal, a mom<br/>\nmade quilt, snuggle time on the couch with a book, anything that gives us<br/>\npleasure to provide. If we do it for ourselves as a gift to them, then we<br/>\ndon&#39;t build up resentment if they don&#39;t appreciate it.

(It&#39;s even bigger if the kids are there voluntarily.) It&#39;s<br/>\na real wake up call when you hear your own reasonable sounding words come<br/>\nout of your child directed at you. Many years ago I heard my daughter echo<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s your mess, you&#39;re the one who needs to clean it up.&quot; Yikes! Not at all<br/>\nthe type of thinking I was hoping to foster.

Any time you inflict a penalty -<br/>\ngrounding, no tv, a spanking, loss of toys, whatever - for something you<br/>\ndecide is an offense - walking in the street, not picking up toys, not<br/>\nmaking beds, whatever - you are punishing.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not afraid of the word &quot;punishment&quot;.  It happens all the time in this<br/>\nworld.  Our neighbor went to jail for child molestation.  Punishment.  If<br/>\nyou choose to speed in your car, you get a ticket.  Punishment.  If you do<br/>\nnot pay the power pill you have no electricity.  Punishment.  You can use<br/>\nthe term as lightly or as heavily as you want I suppose.  Punishment then, I<br/>\nguess is not a bad thing, it just IS in many cases a consequence of your own<br/>\ndecisions.  It does not matter how old you are, or how serious the issue, a<br/>\nconsequence is part of the natural process of decision making.  With in<br/>\nreason, obviously in a family where respect is a high priority.  You can<br/>\nstill have your child face consequences in a very loving and respectful<br/>\nmanner, especially if it is dangerous, i.e. purposely running a stop sign!!<br/>\nOur son when he was four years old was told time and time again to stay in<br/>\nour own driveway with his pedal tractor.  One day, he decided to head down<br/>\nthe middle of the street (very lightly traveled).  I told him &quot;no no&quot;, and<br/>\nhe went ahead and did whatever he wanted to do.  I finally caught up with<br/>\nhim, and the tractor was put away for one week.  He never did it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":36193940,"authorName":"Lewis","from":"&quot;Lewis&quot; &lt;lapin@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] being  better moms","postDate":"1024979893","msgId":38616,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE1BQkJMUEVGQUNISklJQ0NCSU1HTUVLTUNPQUEubGFwaW5Ab2x5cGVuLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGUuMjBlYzc5OTQuMmE0OTM4MDFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":38614,"nextInTopic":38617,"prevInTime":38615,"nextInTime":38617,"topicId":38602,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-848329151\">&lt;&lt; I really do not feel that it is &quot;punishment&quot; to tell your son or daughter<br/>\nthat they need to pick something up, or sweep the floor before they watch tv<br/>\nor play with their legos. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;It is if you say &quot;You didn&#39;t get your socks in the laundry, so you can&#39;t<br/>\nwatch your favorite show tomorrow.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, you misunderstood.......I tell them, they need to pick up the toys<br/>\nFIRST and THEN they may watch tv.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they don&#39;t do it, then I remind them, what we have to do FIRST, in order<br/>\nto what they want to do next.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it is not a punishment, maybe a consequence, but I do not at all relay<br/>\nit as being negative, just a matter of fact thing to do.

If they don&#39;t want to, I say that it needs to<br/>\nbe done, and everyone will do their part.<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, I am right in there with them doing it.  It would be one thing if I was<br/>\nnot doing the same thing.  We do not make beds very often, mostly for<br/>\ncompany, because to me, it just does not matter, and I personally love<br/>\ngetting into my bed when it has been the same since I got out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, on occasion, I feel it necessary to make beds.  So, I tell them to<br/>\nmake their beds.  If they don&#39;t, then there is a consequence.  Again I do<br/>\nnot feel it is punishment.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, I respect the decisions that my children have made.  Such<br/>\nas &quot;Mom, could we just put all the &quot;whatever&quot;, here in the living room from<br/>\nnow on, since we play with them all the time.&quot;  I usually say &quot;sure&quot;.  As I<br/>\nwant them to respect decisions that I make, I also want to respect the<br/>\ndecisions that are really, really important to them.  Our oldest, especially<br/>\nlikes to make some household rules, which I think is so cool.  Sure, maybe<br/>\nhe learned that from me, and he is the oldest typical overly responsible<br/>\nchild, but his brothers like to say their concerns also.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have &quot;family meeting night&quot;.  Not on a regular scheduled basis, but<br/>\nwhenever someone has something to say that would affect the whole family.<br/>\nAnyone can call a family meeting.  Sometimes it is to say &quot;noone can put<br/>\ntheir shoes on the front step cause we are all tripping over them&quot;, or &quot;from<br/>\nnow on, I will pour my own cereal&quot;.  Whatever is important to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it has to do with respect for one another.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne family meeting that we had went crazy!  We sat down to discuss the<br/>\nkitchen chores, and how everyone WANTS to help out.  It was amazing the<br/>\nthings my kids thought of doing.  Then, they decided on the consequences (of<br/>\ntheir own accord) of not doing them.  One was to not be able to use the<br/>\ncomputer for one month.  I had to get out the calendar and explain to my 5<br/>\n1/2, 7 and 9 year olds how long that was for not clearing the table!<br/>\n<br/>\nI just do not want to be a Mom stuck with doing ALL the work.  I feel this<br/>\nespecially because I have three sons to gently guide into this world.<br/>\n<br/>\nFamily meetings are great.  We speak ALL on the SAME level, discuss anything<br/>\nwe want, weighing the consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 7 year old likes to drag ALL his toys into the living room.  Their room<br/>\nis messy, ok it is completely TRASHED because that is the way I like it.<br/>\nHowever, I want the living room to be clean, so I do not step on things and<br/>\nI don&#39;t have to panic when we have an unexpected visitor.  So, it was time<br/>\nto pick up for the evening, and I told him to take his Bionicle collection<br/>\nback to his room.  He did not want to because &quot;his room was too messy&quot;.  I<br/>\nsaid &quot;ok, then what if you play in the LR because your room is too messy,<br/>\nthen when the living room is to messy, you have to play in the dining room,<br/>\netc......&quot;.  He totlly cracked up laughing, and his brothers followed suit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of this discussion has to do with each individual family and<br/>\nhow they function.  Also, what level of chaos a person can handle.  I have<br/>\nfriends, good friends, that have totally trashed houses.  I LOVE these<br/>\npeople.  I enjoy my time with them at their homes or mine.  However, I would<br/>\nnever be able to be at ease in my own home with such a mess.  Believe me, I<br/>\nam not a neat freak.  There are two bike helmets sitting next to me on the<br/>\nfloor, a pair of balled up socks, a lamb stuffed anima., a newspaper picture<br/>\nof spider man, some Bionicle pieces and a captain hook thing.  It is fine<br/>\nfor now, but eventually I will ask the boys to put them away, and it will be<br/>\n&quot;before dinner&quot;, or &quot;before a movie&quot;, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nMind you I do this discipline with myself, as I am sure we all do.  Haven&#39;t<br/>\nyou ever said in your mind that I will buy that new outfit when I loose<br/>\nthree pounds.  Or, if I eat the ice cream today, I will not have some<br/>\ntomorrow.
