Don&#39;t badmouth Flylady!  <br/>\nGo to her homepage, click on Flying Lessons, and read about shining your <br/>\nsink.  Sure, she mentions filling it with water, adding bleach, using a <br/>\ntoothbrush and dental floss if necessary.  But she&#39;s talking about how to <br/>\nclean even the oldest sinks.  And at the end of the paragraph she says <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; You have already done the hard part. You will never have to go through this <br/>\n&gt; process again. Daily maintenance will keep it looking this way all the time<br/>\n    <br/>\n </span></blockquote>She says she just rubs it down with a dry rag at night. <br/>\nFlylady was the kick in the pants I needed to start getting my home under <br/>\ncontrol.  I don&#39;t follow her &quot;religiously&quot;, but I get lots of good ideas <br/>\nthere.  There are LOADS of people on this list, and for those who haven&#39;t <br/>\nheard of her, I didn&#39;t want anyone left with the impression that her advice <br/>\nwas irresponsible.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease read this letter in the lighthearted way it was intended.  I&#39;m not <br/>\nscolding you.
