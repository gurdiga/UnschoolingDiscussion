Just for something to share and enjoy together. There are <br/>\nplenty of other things we share, but one more wouldn&#39;t be bad. Football for <br/>\nus is fun and we enjoy it. It&#39;s not like we watch it every day all year <br/>\nlong. It&#39;s seasonal so that&#39;s when we watch. Kind of like my kids and the <br/>\nWizard of Oz. We have the movie here, but every time it&#39;s on TV, the kids <br/>\njust HAVE to watch it!!!! I don&#39;t see that as a bad thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of spam?

Sports fans are like that. And<br/>\nfootball is as big a part of Thanksgiving as turkey for them, if not bigger, <br/>\nand<br/>\nwhat is so wrong with that? Isn&#39;t the point to have a nice time?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think inviting people over for Thanksgiving and not even making football<br/>\navailable in some room in the back is asking for trouble.  If you don&#39;t have <br/>\nit,<br/>\nit&#39;s only fair to let people know ahead of time. If I did that, I am sure it<br/>\nwould trim my guest list considerably.  Football on Thanksgiving happens<br/>\nto be an American tradition!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n   I have had the same thing happen here. While we do have three televisions<br/>\n   and one VCR, none of them are hooked up to antennas or cable. The only<br/>\n   station that comes in clearly is PBS, and we mostly just watch videos.<br/>\n   When we have had groups of people over for Thanksgiving or New Years,<br/>\n   both adults and children have gotten upset with me that they could not<br/>\n   watch Football games. And I mean, really upset, to the point of<br/>\n   dysfunctional. They would pace around like lost puppies. I&#39;d find them<br/>\n   sitting in their cars in subzero weather tuned in to the radio. Some<br/>\n   people, (my Dad) actually went home. I would hate for something to have<br/>\n   that much of a hold on me. My children can watch TV or tapes at their<br/>\n   whim, and when they go to visit other people, they are there to spend<br/>\n   that time with those people. DD5 often comes home from Grandma&#39;s<br/>\n   disappointed, because the first thing my Mom does is turn on cartoons for<br/>\n   her. DD would much rather spend the time doing something *with* Grandma.<br/>\n   She does think it is pretty cool that cartoons are on all night there<br/>\n   though.<br/>\n   Wende<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.
