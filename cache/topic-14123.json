We are a non-profit group so all<br/>\nproceeds from subscriptions go back to the group and to help keep the<br/>\nnewsletter going. All positions are filled on a volunteer basis. We are an<br/>\ninclusive group that does not make any religion or political philosophy a<br/>\npart of the group&#39;s identity. Our newsletter reflects this foundation. I<br/>\nonly mention all of this so you know the way the newsletter is handled. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the items we have in our Newsletter is a list of recommended<br/>\nreading. This can be either regular reading materials, how to homeschool<br/>\ntype books, or recommended curriculum. Basically what is listed is: The<br/>\nname of the book, the author, a 2 to 3 sentence description, and the name<br/>\nof the person who recommended the book (email address or website link to<br/>\nthe person who recommended is listed if requested).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to hear from any of you about books that you would like to<br/>\nsee recommended to other homeschoolers or to those considering or<br/>\ninterested in homeschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if any of you have any articles you would like to submit for our<br/>\nnewsletter (or know of someone who does), I would love to review them for<br/>\npossible inclusion. You would of course receive full credit for the<br/>\narticle and if you have a website, business, or organization, this can be<br/>\na great way to help promote it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur goal with this newsletter is to make it an excellent resource for<br/>\nhomeschoolers as well as trying to help the general public learn about<br/>\nhomeschooling. So many who do not know about homeschooling often put it<br/>\ndown due to a fear of the unknown. Our newsletter currently goes out to<br/>\nmany businesses that are not officially homeschool related (isn&#39;t<br/>\neverything homeschool related though?), such as some Chiropractic Clinics,<br/>\nVeteranary Clinics, School Supply Stores, etc. Clinics are putting our<br/>\nnewsletter out for their patients to read while in the waiting rooms. We<br/>\nfeel this is a great way to reach many people who might not otherwise know<br/>\nanything about homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any questions or items you would like to submit, you can<br/>\ncontact me: Lara Kimber - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrslarak@...\">mrslarak@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLara Kimber<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mrslarak@...\">mrslarak@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nL.L.G.-Lifetime Learners of Georgia Homeschooling Website:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://llg.freeyellow.com/\">http://llg.freeyellow.com/</a><br/>\nOffering an eclectic mix of homeschooling resources and information. <br/>\nLearn about the L.L.G.
