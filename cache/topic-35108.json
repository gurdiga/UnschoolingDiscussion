It&#39;s just been a series of little<br/>\naha blips in my schoolish mindset. Being of an engineering bent, I adore<br/>\nlinear, step by step learning. I love the feedback that a textbook gives --<br/>\ngetting the right answer and having a physical indication of progress<br/>\nthrough the book -- and the feeling of completeness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing that saved my daughter from having that foisted on her was<br/>\nthat I&#39;d always wondered why learning in school had to be so dull. It was<br/>\nsatisfying in the sense of accomplishment it provided. But tedious. Watching<br/>\nhistorical movies was fun and interesting. Reading history texts was sleep<br/>\ninducing. (My mother thought the D in gym was amusing. &quot;How was it even<br/>\npossible to get a D in gym?&quot; she wondered. ;-) And it *is* ridiculous. What<br/>\n*really* is there to grade in gym? She didn&#39;t think D in history, the only<br/>\nother D I ever got, was so amusing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, even though I read everything I could on AOL&#39;s homeschooling boards<br/>\nwhile my daughter attended preschool, I hung around with the unschoolers for<br/>\nfun because *they* were having so much fun. Their ideas on learning were way<br/>\ntoo fuzzy for me. No one was working towards a particular academic goal. It<br/>\nwas &quot;just throw everything at the kids and see what comes out&quot;. Way too<br/>\nunsettling for an engineer!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet the theories behind unschooling started to make sense. (Sandra and<br/>\nPamS were especially helpful :-) And I found I could actually explain it to<br/>\nothers even when I wasn&#39;t sure I totally bought it myself. I did<br/>\nintellectually but it was ripping my poor engineering heart out ;-) But I&#39;m<br/>\nalso an artist -- an artist inhibited by engineering love of one right<br/>\nanswer -- so perhaps that part of my brain asserted itself and saved my<br/>\ndaughter from Calvert ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] When I got it","postDate":"1019055992","msgId":35174,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3Ni42YzcxZDY1LjI5ZWVlOTc4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35146,"nextInTopic":35181,"prevInTime":35173,"nextInTime":35175,"topicId":35108,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/16/02 6:43:50 PM, mfhick@hotmail.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-615181370\">In a message dated 4/16/02 6:43:50 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mfhick@...\">mfhick@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I&#39;m trying to grapple with my fears that my son will be <br/>\ndeprived academically from hours zoning out on TV. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you could cheaply and easily come and watch TV with my kids a couple <br/>\nof days.  They&#39;re plenty expressive and talkative about what they&#39;re seeing.  <br/>\nI think they would still be learning if they weren&#39;t chatty, but the fact <br/>\nthat they are makes a big picture window into their learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hours zoning out on TV won&#39;t deprive him academically if he&#39;s watching <br/>\nthings that interest him, with pictures of people, places, things which he <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have seen otherwise, with music and dancing and sports he wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave heard or seen otherwise, with costumes and equipment and animals and...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s encouraged and not shamed, TV will seem bigger and better, too.<br/>\nParental encouragement is all that makes the difference between a toddler <br/>\nexploring a park or being a bad boy who left the playground.  (Look! I&#39;ve <br/>\nslipped right into a parenting discussion without intending to!)  When Kirby <br/>\nwas little he sat by me a lot.  He wanted me to set him on the swings and <br/>\npush him.  He wanted me to watch him go down the slide.   Marty wanted to go <br/>\nfar and climb high.  So rather than telling him no, I would find older kids <br/>\nto go with him and climb with him to help him down if necessary, or I would <br/>\nfollow behind him far enough that he had that feeling of being all alone in <br/>\nthe wide world, but he still wasn&#39;t out of sight of me.  Too many mom&#39;s, when <br/>\nthey say &quot;Don&#39;t go out of sight of me&quot; mean &quot;I&#39;m going to sit right here and <br/>\nnot move, and so that limits your range of movement.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat limited range of movement can happen if a mom just wants to stay home <br/>\nand not change any of her ways or beliefs or practices, too.  And if watching <br/>\nTV for four hours is as bad as climbing up a hill looking for wild <br/>\nstrawberries even though there was no way to get lost, but the kid is told <br/>\n&quot;bad&quot; anyway, there is sorrow where there didn&#39;t need to be any.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Parenting (was When I got it)","postDate":"1019034593","msgId":35146,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4RTJCNDIxLjc1NzclZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PEYxNDdlclM3S2lBRjY0UXFHMFgwMDAwYTI5NkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35123,"nextInTopic":35174,"prevInTime":35145,"nextInTime":35147,"topicId":35108,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"on 4/16/02 7:26 PM, Mary Hickman at mfhick@hotmail.com wrote: ...
