I was constantly <br/>\npointing out ways to make it more positive, because the coach sometimes <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t stay positive, although his negative wasn&#39;t too bad comparitively.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had a kid in Little League for all of the last 15 years.  I&#39;ve had <br/>\na lot of time in the stands and lots of experiences with volunteer <br/>\ncoaches and time to think about how to teach kids to play baseball and <br/>\ndo it in a way that connects with the kid.  Some kids are way into it, <br/>\nand you can talk to them rationally about the game. They&#39;ve seen lots of <br/>\nprofessional games, play it constantly with the kids in the <br/>\nneighborhood, etc.  My son is one of those. There are a few of those on <br/>\nevery team.  You usually only have to work on their fundamentals, and <br/>\nteach them a little finesse.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also a few on every team who have rarely, if ever, played.  No <br/>\none talks to them about baseball, or they talk over the kid&#39;s head about <br/>\nit.  The parents react negatively if they miss a grounder, etc.  They&#39;re <br/>\nthe ones in the outfield playing in the dirt or throwing their glove up <br/>\nin the air.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, dh and I had this long conversation about giving the kids metaphors <br/>\nfor their imaginations to use while they&#39;re playing the game.  When my <br/>\n20 yo was playing catcher at 10 and 11, we had a conversation about him <br/>\nbeing a giant magnet behind the plate, and that no ball could resist <br/>\nhim.  My son still remembers that, 10 years later.  He said it helped. <br/>\n I think kids who don&#39;t live for baseball (insert other thing here) need <br/>\na way to relate the acts of baseball, either to their life or their <br/>\nimagination.  Metaphors will work for some kids, and I encouraged dh to <br/>\ncome up with a ready supply for the most common baseball situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t think dh was putting any stock in the metaphor idea.  But we <br/>\nwere talking about a really spectacular slide into home by Brandon, who <br/>\nwas playing for the first time this year.  He ran like the wind and <br/>\navoided the tag, and it was not expected to happen that way.  Dh <br/>\nexplained that while he was coaching third base and Brandon was stopped <br/>\nthere, he looked down in mock surprise and said, &quot;Look, what&#39;s that on <br/>\nyour feet?!  Wings!  You&#39;re feet are growing wings!&quot;  Dh said Brandon <br/>\nlooked up and smiled.  And then when the ball was hit, he made it home. <br/>\n For the rest of the season, every time Brandon got to third  they <br/>\ntalked about his winged feet.  And even if it didn&#39;t result in improved <br/>\nperformance, the kid is having a great time, and seeing his face light <br/>\nup like that is worth it!<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":689589,"authorName":"KT","from":"KT &lt;Tuck@...&gt;","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Teaching vs. Learning","postDate":"1026044383","msgId":39037,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEMjgzMURGLjQwNTAyMDRAbWlkc291dGgucnIuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDIwNzA2LjE2NDEwMC4tMTQxMjMzLjQuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39032,"nextInTopic":39040,"prevInTime":39036,"nextInTime":39038,"topicId":38981,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There are naturally some kids who get to 6 <br/>\n  pitches and two strikes every time they get up, and it&#39;s clinch time. <br/>\n  If they don&#39;t hit the next pitch, the coach gets tense, the parents get <br/>\n  tense and all the hopes are riding on this one pitch.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Invariably, in 15 games this year, and in probably every game in the <br/>\n  last 2 seasons we were there, the coach says, &quot;Okay, Jason, you *have* <br/>\n  to swing at this pitch.&quot;  *swing at*.   I believe he should be saying, <br/>\n  &quot;Okay, Jason, you *have* to *HIT* this pitch.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Simple tweak of thought and therefore expectation.  The &quot;swing at&quot; <br/>\n  implies to the kid that he&#39;s a strikeout.  The &quot;hit&quot; implies to the kid <br/>\n  that the coach still has hope.  Or maybe the coach should just harness <br/>\n  the power of positive thinking.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I would like to report that the coach changed his language and Jason <br/>\n  started hitting the ball.  Jason did start hitting the ball on occasion, <br/>\n  but it was in spite of the coach&#39;s discouraging language.

(We&#39;re freaks about baseball around here.) <br/>\n Will plays coach-pitch.  Each batter gets 7 pitches or 3 strikes, <br/>\nthrown by his own coach.  There are naturally some kids who get to 6 <br/>\npitches and two strikes every time they get up, and it&#39;s clinch time. <br/>\n If they don&#39;t hit the next pitch, the coach gets tense, the parents get <br/>\ntense and all the hopes are riding on this one pitch.  <br/>\n<br/>\nInvariably, in 15 games this year, and in probably every game in the <br/>\nlast 2 seasons we were there, the coach says, &quot;Okay, Jason, you *have* <br/>\nto swing at this pitch.&quot;  *swing at*.   I believe he should be saying, <br/>\n&quot;Okay, Jason, you *have* to *HIT* this pitch.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSimple tweak of thought and therefore expectation.  The &quot;swing at&quot; <br/>\nimplies to the kid that he&#39;s a strikeout.  The &quot;hit&quot; implies to the kid <br/>\nthat the coach still has hope.  Or maybe the coach should just harness <br/>\nthe power of positive thinking.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to report that the coach changed his language and Jason <br/>\nstarted hitting the ball.  Jason did start hitting the ball on occasion, <br/>\nbut it was in spite of the coach&#39;s discouraging language.  There are so <br/>\nmany examples in baseball that I hear male coaches use without thinking. <br/>\n I want my own team!  <br/>\n<br/>\nTuck</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":689589,"authorName":"KT","from":"KT &lt;Tuck@...&gt;","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Teaching vs. Learning","postDate":"1025996776","msgId":39015,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEMjc3N0U4LjYwOTA3MDhAbWlkc291dGgucnIuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFhOS40YWFmODcyLjJhNTg2NGMzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39010,"nextInTopic":39016,"prevInTime":39014,"nextInTime":39016,"topicId":38981,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I am not saying it is a good or a bad thing. <br/>\nAll I am pointing out is that, yes, they express a position of power <br/>\nin which TEACH, by being a transitive verb, expresses power upon an<br/>\nobject; whereas LEARN, by being intransitive, expresses the power of a subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese things are fascinating because, again, a lot of this is not <br/>\nabout what we learn or do not learn but about who has the power over <br/>\nlearning (or teaching). Which brings me to the comment about canons: <br/>\nI am the first one to admit to having a heck of a hard time with <br/>\ntaking someone else&#39;s teaching.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of the times I do not write observations, I teach --and it is <br/>\nhard not to because, I am after all a scholar (a creative one but a <br/>\nscholar, nonetheless). So I actually react at comments that I read as <br/>\n*teachings* (even though I do it myself). In other words, I am not <br/>\nreacting to the observation ---I am reacting to, what I took as *the <br/>\nteaching*.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this is part of my deschooling process and, quite frankly, I <br/>\nam just letting it be. What I am trying to do with these postings is <br/>\nsomething aching to performing a biopsy on myself --opening up the <br/>\nentrails, stepping back, and just looking at what it is in there.

I read on another unschooling list and I seem to be <br/>\nthe instigator there. I don&#39;t mean to be. People post things like *What math <br/>\ncurriculum do you all use?* and I reply that we don&#39;t use math curriculum or <br/>\nwhat ever. That sets off a storm of debate on whether or not using a <br/>\ncurriculum can still be unschooling. I try to explain what the spirit of <br/>\nunschooling is, I must be a dismal failure though. I get replies that *We <br/>\nunschool during the summer, the kids are allowed to play and have all the fun <br/>\nthey want exploring their own interests.* or *I let the kids study on the <br/>\nporch swing or lying down on the couch.* or *We unschool subjects that don&#39;t <br/>\nmatter, like art and music but I make sure the kids cover the basics like <br/>\nmath and English. Then we do more fun things like unit studies for history, <br/>\nand the kids are allowed to pick out their own reading material.* How is this <br/>\nunschooling? Why deceive yourselves? Some have suggested that I am hung up on <br/>\na label or that unschooling can mean anything you want it too, it is not a <br/>\nmembers only club. I say, no I am not hung up on a label, (but maybe I am) <br/>\nand I certainly hope it isn&#39;t a club. But, to me, unschooling doesn&#39;t mean <br/>\njust anything, and you can&#39;t make it mean just anything. Unschooling just is. <br/>\nI too used to wonder why I was so unsuccessful. For all the attachment <br/>\nparenting, family bed, prolonged nursing, freedom from institutionalized <br/>\neducation, I practiced, I didn&#39;t seem to be able to grasp that bigger <br/>\npicture. I still had hang-ups. I wanted to use punishment effectively, I <br/>\nwanted everyone to do their chores with smiles on their faces, I expected <br/>\nmany things to be the way I wanted them to be. Coming here has given me a <br/>\npeek at the bigger picture. You can&#39;t just unschool when it comes to <br/>\n*schoolish* things. You can&#39;t turn unschooling off at the end of the <br/>\nafternoon and expect things to be hunky-dory. You can&#39;t respect your <br/>\nchildren&#39;s choices in learning but not respect their choices in life. How can <br/>\nwe say *Johnny, mommy has decided that unschooling is what is best for you? <br/>\nNow you can explore the world at your leisure, but don&#39;t forget to fold that <br/>\nload of laundry exactly how I told you!* or *I trust you will learn all about <br/>\nart on your own, but I am making sure you don&#39;t miss out on math!*<br/>\nI certainly don&#39;t want to turn unschooling into something that says there is <br/>\nonly one way to unschool. I don&#39;t want visions of unschoolers at conventions <br/>\nwith pamphlets and smiling faces saying &quot;can I take some time to show you how <br/>\nto unschool the right way?&quot; But, I firmly believe there is a spirit to <br/>\nunschooling. There is a bigger picture. And thanks to people like Joyce, Tia, <br/>\nSandra, Sue, and all the others here, I see more of that picture everyday. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117951149,"authorName":"Mary Muday","from":"Mary Muday &lt;supermom50mm@...&gt;","profile":"supermom50mm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Teaching vs. Learning","postDate":"1025978855","msgId":39005,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNzA2MTgwNzM1LjU3NjU0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzMDA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDcwNjA4MzkxOC4wMjk1MzUxMEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+"},"prevInTopic":39003,"nextInTopic":39006,"prevInTime":39004,"nextInTime":39006,"topicId":38981,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for the very positive observance, and I m going to follow the advice to let my student, my child follow her own way, just to provide positive","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1090999774\">Thanks for the very positive observance, and I&#39;m going to follow the advice to let my student, my child follow her own way, just to provide positive reassurance in education, I do believe that everything we do daily is learning.

This, though is <br/>\na classic example of what I consider deschooling. My kids could give <br/>\na fiddler&#39;s fart* about teaching or learning --they are actually <br/>\nplaying and having a great time with what they&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI, on the other hand, am the one who qualified this as *teaching <br/>\nthemselves*. I wonder, though why the problem with that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2) One could look at cognitive psychology and say that words shape <br/>\nthe world; therefore, the words we choose will have an impact on how <br/>\nwe live. I agree with that on some levels and not on others.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, you may suggest learning vs. teaching, but those are your words <br/>\nand not mine. I don&#39;t own them but that&#39;s OK. It does not mean that I <br/>\nam doing less of a job at unschooling than other people. It just <br/>\nmeans I have not found my own vocabulary (or at least, am in the <br/>\nprocess of doing so).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3) I have pointed this out before so I&#39;ll do it again: When we get <br/>\ninto details like *learn* vs. *teach*, what we all are doing is <br/>\ninsisting on an UNSCHOOLING CANON. And I have to tell you, not only <br/>\ndo I think it is an oxymoron, but I find that very discomforting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf unschooling is a lifestyle that is meant to counter the <br/>\n&quot;pre-packaged life&quot; that social mores dictate we follow, each and <br/>\nevery one of us will find the words, the styles and the rituals that <br/>\nwill define our new lifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand you meant to point out the philosophical difference <br/>\nbetween  *teach* and *learn*. Nevertheless, I particularly like the <br/>\nauthority reversal of my kids being their own teachers as opposed to <br/>\nsomebody else.  That might change though, as we do this for as long <br/>\nas y&#39;all have been doing this. But then again, it is a POV that comes <br/>\nnatural (or should we say &#39;automatic&#39;) to me ---it is, after all, <br/>\ningrained in my native tongue, Spanish.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Caribbean Spanish, you do not raise children --children raise <br/>\nthemselves. We do not say, &quot;Crié a mis hijos en Nueva York&quot; (I <br/>\n*raised* my sons in New York). We say, &quot;Mis hijos se criaron en Nueva <br/>\nYork&quot; (My sons *raised themselves* in New York).
