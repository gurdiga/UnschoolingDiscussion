Why taching our children Latin is<br/>\n*essential* (though none of the moms took it save one with 2 yrs in high<br/>\nschool)!    And the askance looks when I respond to questions about our<br/>\ncurriculum usage.  ( I usually say something along the lines.....we don&#39;t<br/>\nuse a specific curriculum,  we draw from a large variety of resources.)
