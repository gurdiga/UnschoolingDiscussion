What a fun day you had!<br/>\n<br/>\n I often read these emails looking and searching for what others do with <br/>\ntheir children. We do a lot with the kids but sometimes I find it difficult <br/>\nto beak down the days when asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe past few days I have been asked many questions about Homeschooling and <br/>\nUnschooling. Our son was asked by a neighbor the other day what he does all <br/>\nday, he explained it so much better than I would have.  I also have a friend <br/>\nlooking into HS so she has been wanting to know about our days.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me give this a shot.<br/>\nDustin our 11 yr. old taught himself how to skim board. He wanted to surf but <br/>\nthe water is still a bit cold here. We attended a HS meeting, the kids played <br/>\nand had a blast. Dustin went to see X2 the X Men Movie last night with his <br/>\ndad.  He wanted to tell me all about the movie last night but they got back <br/>\nat 12:30 and Dad said to tell me in the am.  So im in bed this morning and I <br/>\nroll over and there he is &quot;Mom do you want to hear about the movie now,&quot; lol <br/>\ntoo funny <br/>\n Today we went to the dump, we have a very small dump it is more like three <br/>\ntrailer sized dumpsters. There is a free-be barn at our dump where you can <br/>\nget or drop off books, desks, bikes, toys etc.. Our little one Cassidy likes <br/>\nto find treasures, she has a good eye for cool toys.<br/>\nAfter that we picked up two ride toys at a yard sale dropped them off at <br/>\nhome, took out our Brittany pup one more time, then off to Best Buy to look <br/>\nfor another VCR for Cassidy.<br/>\n<br/>\nDustin went ahead to Best Buy to play video games and Cassidy, Nicholas and I <br/>\nwent to Old Navy. My little girl is three and is such a sweetie, sometimes I <br/>\nhave to look twice at her to make sure she is still 3.  She handed me a <br/>\nbathing suit today and she says Mom I&#39;ll take this one it will look &quot;weally&quot; <br/>\ngood on me. She loves to shop!<br/>\n<br/>\n Then to Best Buy to meet Dustin and search for a VCR with Auto repeat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe came home the kids played with their new found ride toys, Jumped on the <br/>\ntrampoline and Collected rocks (Cassidy collected and the puppy chewed).  <br/>\nLater Dustin and I went to Stroudwater Books. They are closing so we searched <br/>\nthe entire store for a good deal. Spent a good hour and a half there. He <br/>\nchoose a book on Navy Seals and 1001 commonly used Spanish words. He wants to <br/>\nlearn Spanish but really wanted audio tapes he is convinced if he plays them <br/>\nwhen he sleeps he will learn it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe then went to Goodwill, where we stumbled on a VCR for Cassidy, a CD tower <br/>\nfor Dustin and a VCR tape drawer.  I love this store they always have <br/>\nsomething I am looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur last stop was to the grocery store. Dustin loves to tell people he is <br/>\nHomeschooled (He says HS but explains Unschooling, people here only know one <br/>\nterm) so tonight he is at the register and somehow finds a way to slide it in <br/>\nthere. I think tonight he said something about no bed time. Lol That got the <br/>\nclerks attention. ( I did add to the conversation that he has no bed time but <br/>\nis asleep usually before 11 and up at 7-8) Well to make a long story short he <br/>\nanswered all her questions with pride and as we walked away we could hear her <br/>\ntalking to the next customers in line. I didn&#39;t catch all of it but I could <br/>\nhear her saying how great a kid he was and how cool it all sounded. I didn&#39;t <br/>\nthink he herd her but when we got out side he said Mom did you hear her! I <br/>\nsaid yeah I did.  So he made sure he brought his cart back in the farthest <br/>\ndoor so she saw him returning the cart. That made his night.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the way home we herd the about the Man in the Mountain breaking away in NH <br/>\nand discussed some of the history behind it all. The rock face is no more a <br/>\ngreat piece of NH. I would imagine people will still visit but if they never <br/>\nsaw it in person sad to say they never will....<br/>\n<br/>\nToday was more running than life I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139549710,"authorName":"Olga","from":"&quot;Olga&quot; &lt;britcontoo@...&gt;","profile":"britcontoo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: An unschooled lesson in balance","postDate":"1052009395","msgId":67612,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI5MW8zais3MTRtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA0NzIwMWMzMTE3YSQ3YWJiZGJjMCQ2NDAxYThjMEB0YXJ6YW4+"},"prevInTopic":67606,"nextInTopic":67629,"prevInTime":67611,"nextInTime":67613,"topicId":67462,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... wrote: We just sort of went through the same break through with our almost 5 year old :)  He has been trying to learn to ride a bike for a while (with","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-748940659\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;24hrmom&quot; &lt;24hrmom@s...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just sort of went through the same break through with our almost 5 <br/>\nyear old :)  He has been trying to learn to ride a bike for a while <br/>\n(with training wheels) but never could get it, and never lasted more <br/>\nthan a few minutes, I am talking over a year here.

Previous summers she had made some attempts with <br/>\nher training wheels off, but got frustrated and scared and asked for <br/>\nthem back. So last night out we went and Rocco tuned up the bike <br/>\n(which is now decidedly too small - oh well) and off she went.  She <br/>\nasked me to help, and promptly got frustrated, but I soon managed to <br/>\nunobtrusively disappear so she could figure it out in peace.  I went <br/>\nto the garage and practically cleared it out for an upcoming yard <br/>\nsale my Mom is having!  During the next hour and a half she kept at <br/>\nit, up and down the sidewalk.  When she finally came in she said she <br/>\nworked at it but didn&#39;t feel much further ahead, but it was said very <br/>\nmatter-of-factly, not frustrated.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, this morning she got dressed and went back out to her <br/>\n </span></blockquote>bike.  Michael (5) decided he wanted his training wheels off as <br/>\nwell.  In fact, as I was gazing over the situation, he had already <br/>\npulled out the wrapped up wrench set and said &quot;Here you go&quot;!  LOL <br/>\nUnfortunately one side was very tight and we had to leave the <br/>\nlubricating oil on to soak in. About an hour or so later, as I was <br/>\nquickly working my way through my backlog of emails from here, she <br/>\ncame in and announced she could now ride a bike.  I went out to see <br/>\nher ride ... I must say, she was pretty good!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; During the afternoon she was searching ebay for stuff and found a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>big box of Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans which she bought with <br/>\nsome of her birthday money.  She asked me to spell a few words for <br/>\nher - since searching mis-spelled words wouldn&#39;t work very well!  <br/>\nJoseph (11) was up and playing his gameboy, researching stuff on the <br/>\ninternet, and hanging around.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I emailed Rocco back at work about a discussion we&#39;ve been having.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I had sent him a blurb a couple days ago about the discussion here on <br/>\nleading busy, interesting lives and he had replied about not really <br/>\nbeing interested in being &quot;busy&quot; in the goal-oriented, materialistic <br/>\nsense he felt many North-Americans pursued.  I replied that I hadn&#39;t <br/>\nmeant that at all and that the suggestions he had given were <br/>\nwonderful ways to keep &quot;busy&quot;, as opposed to &quot;fast-paced&quot;.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rocco managed to get home relatively early and Michael accosted him <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to remove the second training wheel and then Alyssa asked to build <br/>\nthe teeter-totter (seesaw) she and Rocco had designed on paper last <br/>\nnight.  Next time I stopped by the front door, Alyssa and Michael <br/>\nwere seesawing!  They added handles (so Michael didn&#39;t go flying), <br/>\nand stabilizers so it didn&#39;t roll off the buckets being used as the <br/>\nfulcrum.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then Alyssa asked if we could order pizza and have a Mario Party <br/>\n </span></blockquote>night.  We decided to go ahead so I put the steak back in the fridge <br/>\nfor tomorrow and Rocco picked up a pizza.  We all sat downstairs and <br/>\nmunched pizza and Rocco and the kids played Mario Party 4.  Joseph <br/>\nput his player on computer mode and was still researching on the <br/>\ncomputer downstairs and playing his gameboy but often came over to <br/>\ncomment on the mini-games etc. I sat with them and was reading my <br/>\ncopy of The Out-of-Sync Child book ... interesting.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; When the game was over, Alyssa asked if I could read some more of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the Harry Potter Goblet of Fire book (our 4th time through) and she <br/>\nadded &quot;to celebrate my being able to ride a bike&quot;. I just know she <br/>\nthrew that in to try to keep me awake longer! LOL  So I got Michael <br/>\nset up for bed in his room watching one of his Scooby Doo tapes (he&#39;s <br/>\nnot interested in hearing the book again and again!) and I read a <br/>\ncouple chapters to Alyssa and Joseph in her room - she also just <br/>\nbought a heated throw blanket with some of her birthday money - <br/>\ncozy!

It figured in our day as well ... but a bit later.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Alyssa (just turned 9) decided she wanted to learn how to ride her bike.   Previous summers she had made some attempts with her training wheels off, but got frustrated and scared and asked for them back. So last night out we went and Rocco tuned up the bike (which is now decidedly too small - oh well) and off she went.  She asked me to help, and promptly got frustrated, but I soon managed to unobtrusively disappear so she could figure it out in peace.  I went to the garage and practically cleared it out for an upcoming yard sale my Mom is having!  During the next hour and a half she kept at it, up and down the sidewalk.  When she finally came in she said she worked at it but didn&#39;t feel much further ahead, but it was said very matter-of-factly, not frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this morning she got dressed and went back out to her bike.  Michael (5) decided he wanted his training wheels off as well.  In fact, as I was gazing over the situation, he had already pulled out the wrapped up wrench set and said &quot;Here you go&quot;!  LOL Unfortunately one side was very tight and we had to leave the lubricating oil on to soak in. About an hour or so later, as I was quickly working my way through my backlog of emails from here, she came in and announced she could now ride a bike.  I went out to see her ride ... I must say, she was pretty good!<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the afternoon she was searching ebay for stuff and found a big box of Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans which she bought with some of her birthday money.  She asked me to spell a few words for her - since searching mis-spelled words wouldn&#39;t work very well!  Joseph (11) was up and playing his gameboy, researching stuff on the internet, and hanging around.<br/>\n<br/>\nI emailed Rocco back at work about a discussion we&#39;ve been having.  I had sent him a blurb a couple days ago about the discussion here on leading busy, interesting lives and he had replied about not really being interested in being &quot;busy&quot; in the goal-oriented, materialistic sense he felt many North-Americans pursued.  I replied that I hadn&#39;t meant that at all and that the suggestions he had given were wonderful ways to keep &quot;busy&quot;, as opposed to &quot;fast-paced&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nRocco managed to get home relatively early and Michael accosted him to remove the second training wheel and then Alyssa asked to build the teeter-totter (seesaw) she and Rocco had designed on paper last night.  Next time I stopped by the front door, Alyssa and Michael were seesawing!  They added handles (so Michael didn&#39;t go flying), and stabilizers so it didn&#39;t roll off the buckets being used as the fulcrum.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen Alyssa asked if we could order pizza and have a Mario Party night.  We decided to go ahead so I put the steak back in the fridge for tomorrow and Rocco picked up a pizza.  We all sat downstairs and munched pizza and Rocco and the kids played Mario Party 4.  Joseph put his player on computer mode and was still researching on the computer downstairs and playing his gameboy but often came over to comment on the mini-games etc. I sat with them and was reading my copy of The Out-of-Sync Child book ... interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the game was over, Alyssa asked if I could read some more of the Harry Potter Goblet of Fire book (our 4th time through) and she added &quot;to celebrate my being able to ride a bike&quot;. I just know she threw that in to try to keep me awake longer! LOL  So I got Michael set up for bed in his room watching one of his Scooby Doo tapes (he&#39;s not interested in hearing the book again and again!) and I read a couple chapters to Alyssa and Joseph in her room - she also just bought a heated throw blanket with some of her birthday money - cozy!  And Rocco had some alone time to pursue his interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, a pretty cool unschooling day, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd tomorrow we&#39;re going to Kortright, the local conservation centre, for the Four Winds Kite Festival.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117187741,"authorName":"unolist","from":"&quot;unolist&quot; &lt;unolist@...&gt;","profile":"unolist","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Heather in Ohio","postDate":"1051969244","msgId":67497,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI5MGdzcytvM2IxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGI5MGZ0MitwZTZoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67494,"nextInTopic":67501,"prevInTime":67496,"nextInTime":67498,"topicId":67462,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... have ... out ...

We made shadow puppets on the walls and <br/>\nscarey faces in the candle-light.  BIG problem though!  DOH!  I forgot <br/>\ndinner was in the oven! ROFL!!!  Not to spoil the secret, we made sandwiches <br/>\nan stuck the lasagna in the fridge to finish cooking tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really been a great day!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] An unschooled lesson in balance","postDate":"1051936193","msgId":67473,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyMS4yMTdmMDA1Yy4yYmU0OWZjMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67462,"nextInTopic":67477,"prevInTime":67472,"nextInTime":67474,"topicId":67462,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/2/03 7:52:20 PM, jmcseals@msn.com writes:  Jennifer, I liked your see-saw story!

(probably they <br/>\nalready have done that! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment, Kirby&#39;s at the new X-Men movie with a guy who works with him.  <br/>\nThen he&#39;s going the the anime club meeting, which meets late after the comic <br/>\nbook shop closes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMarty and Jeremy (another homeschooler) are in the back yard fencing.  Jeremy <br/>\ngot fencing equipment for his birthday.  There&#39;s no moon and it&#39;s dark, so <br/>\nKeith groused some about safety, but we have some floodlights, not great <br/>\nones, and after Keith coached them a bit, Sadie (former homeschooler, now <br/>\nfulltime college student) is out there &quot;marshaling.&quot;  Holly was on the swings <br/>\nwatching, but is inside watching the Simpsons now.  Joey (homeschooled, kinda <br/>\nlives quietly in the shadows at our house a lot, but was at a family dinner <br/>\ntonight because a cousin came to town) is outside watching.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn hour ago, Holly and I were at a fabric store buying cloth for a new top <br/>\nfor the little medieval tent she&#39;s using Memorial Day.  We found something <br/>\ngood for $1.97 and it turned out to be half price.  Woohoo!  It&#39;s an old <br/>\ntent, top is worn, sides are fine, faded black.  Got faded-black and <br/>\nnot-so-white striped stuff which will look wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo hours ago, Keith&#39;s best friend Bob was here.  He brought a banjo for <br/>\nMarty to borrow to see if he wants to pursue that as an instrument.  Only bad <br/>\nthing is Marty&#39;s a lefty.  So he can either learn to play it right handed, or <br/>\nwe can spend big bucks for a left-handed banjo.  But for now he can at least <br/>\nlook at some chord charts and picking patterns and get an idea of the <br/>\nsituation.  And maybe he&#39;ll be one of those guys who can just do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby worked today.  Before he went to work (still working backwards), the <br/>\nrest of the family went to Garduño&#39;s, a nice New Mexican restaurant, for <br/>\nHolly&#39;s 11-and-a-half birthday lunch.  We had a really good time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore that, Holly had been off with other friends who were in a dance <br/>\nrecital.  She had left the house at 8:10 and got back at 12:30.  Marty hadn&#39;t <br/>\ngotten up til noon.  Kirby was up going through some of the stuff from his <br/>\nroom-cleanup.  Packed three boxes of detritus into one box and stored it in <br/>\nhis closet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere in there Holly and I went to the grocery store, Marty and I had <br/>\nbreakfast together, Keith and Holly and I had sandwiches together on homemade <br/>\nbread, talked about the return of Hulk Hogan (as Mr. America, with a mask), <br/>\nand about a card game Kirby had brought out that he had told me about, called <br/>\n&quot;Gother Than Thou.&quot;  Very humorous cards.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTomorrow morning Keith, Marty, Holly and Sadie are going to Edgewood to help <br/>\nclean up the site where we&#39;ll all be camping Memorial Day weekend.  A couple <br/>\nof thousand people (or a few hundred fewer), medieval village for a long <br/>\nweekend. This is the thirtieth annual Grand Outlandish Tournament.  I totally <br/>\nmissed the first two, went for a few hours of #3, attended full-blown #4, and <br/>\norganized and ran #5.   Tired and old now, I&#39;ll organize the kids&#39; clothes, <br/>\ncamp food and schedule and make sure all the necessary kitchen equipment is <br/>\nout there, but will probably day trip.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEach kid will have an individual medieval-style tent.  Kirby&#39;s and Holly&#39;s <br/>\nare revivals (new frames and ropes) of a couple of basically arming <br/>\ntent/storage room things, tall enough to stand in but not huge. Center pole, <br/>\nhanging square frame at 5&#39;, and four corner ropes.  Holly&#39;s will have a new <br/>\nroof.  Marty will be in a new tent and new design to us.  No center pole, two <br/>\npoles and two ropes.  10&#39; on each side at the bottom, room to stand just <br/>\nright in the middle.  It&#39;s a Viking tent thing based on making a tent with <br/>\ntwo oars and a sail.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily, it&#39;s very unlikely to rain in New Mexico in May at that elevation.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh.  After sandwiches, Keith and I went through the four songs we&#39;re doing <br/>\nfor a friend&#39;s wedding in two weeks.  We&#39;re playing recorder, by ear/memory, <br/>\nfor Bride&#39;s entry, candle-lighting ceremony, recession, and the intro of the <br/>\nbride and groom at the reception.  And we talked about the progress on the <br/>\nthree tents.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"jmcseals SEALS","from":"&quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"An unschooled lesson in balance","postDate":"1051926606","msgId":67462,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjM1ZktRdTFiQ2RVZzAwMDAxNjc5OEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":67473,"prevInTime":67461,"nextInTime":67463,"topicId":67462,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What a fun afternoon!

My 5 yr old daughter, Lauren, was playing with a fork <br/>\ntoday.  As I was watching her, I noticed she was figuring out how to balance <br/>\nthe fork on the edge of one finger.  Moving it back an forth so that it was <br/>\ncloser to the tongs, where the weight was.  She finally got it and ran over <br/>\nto show Nicholette, almost 7.  Nic was impressed and decided to grab her own <br/>\nfork and try it.  It worked!  I just sat quietly observing and smiling with <br/>\npride. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nEthan, 35 months, walked in the room and Lauren showed him how it worked.  <br/>\nWell, he decided to grab a stick and try it with a stick instead.  So cute, <br/>\nwatching him try to balance it at the end, as they were doing with the <br/>\nforks.  Of course, the stick was fairly evenly balanced at each end, so he <br/>\nhad to try it in the middle.  He figured it out after several tries on his <br/>\nown.  Finally, it was Ethan that decided to show me this new trick.  He <br/>\nbalanced the fork, the stick and tried a big earth digger truck, but it was <br/>\ntoo heavy for his little finger to hold. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNot wanting to give up the secret just yet, I asked the kids if they wanted <br/>\nto go outside and see if the same thing happens with bigger objects and <br/>\npeople.  Nicholette chimed in that, &quot;OH YEAH!!!  The see-saw!!!&quot;  I love it <br/>\nwhen they have those light bulb moments. &lt;bg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we played on the see-saw for well over an hour.  Trading positions with <br/>\nheavier and lighter members of the family to see how we could balance it <br/>\nevenly in the air.  The kids thought it was so funny that three of them <br/>\ncould sit together on one end but only Mommy was on the other. LOL!  <br/>\nSuddenly, it occurred to Lauren that she had a name for this <br/>\nphenomenon...BALANCE!!!  &quot;MOMMY!!  We can all balance the see-saw together!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about why they thought it wouldn&#39;t work with just one person on <br/>\none end and no one on the other.  Why Mommy could sit on one end but three <br/>\nof the kids sat on the other end to make it balance.  We talked about weight <br/>\nand force and how they effect the see-saw, but in very simplistic terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this led into a discussion on catapults, which we had just watched a <br/>\nshow on PBS about this morning.  Suddenly, the show, of which they had <br/>\nlittle interest in this morning, became real and alive for them!  Nicholette <br/>\nmade the connection that the swinging catapult had to be balanced in order <br/>\nto &#39;throw&#39; the ball.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, tomorrow we are going to make catapults to throw water balloons at each <br/>\nother...Nic&#39;s idea &lt;bg&gt;.  I suspect there will be an &#39;un-lesson&#39; in that as <br/>\nwell!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did you do today???<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nHelp STOP SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67705,"nextTopicId":67464}}
