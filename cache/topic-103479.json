I can see <br/>\nwhy people who do think about it that way make the decision to just get <br/>\nrid of it or to have set time limits. I can see why they have to have a <br/>\nfamily meeting and make a joint decision to &quot;control&quot; it, etc. If you <br/>\nthink it is addictive and that the kids &quot;can&#39;t&quot; control themselves when <br/>\nwatching it - then what else could you do?<br/>\n<br/>\n***Oh, our family meetings are about everything.

I think of it as something my husband loves - it is a <br/>\nPOSITIVE thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n***When I wrote of not having the tv any longer, I really was talking personally about us. Not anyone else. Since we barely ever watch it, found it not satisfying to ourselves, and we&#39;d be wasting money on it come my birthday if my sister decided to not make that her next birthday present to me (and she&#39;d be wasting money on it for us on my next birthday if she did!), it would be best not to have it. We&#39;d still have the video games... but no tv channels. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow it is no different than my 17 yo singing her musical theater songs <br/>\naround the house. It is all good.

My son is always singing from morning til night. (He sings in his sleep sometimes!) And the piano is a favorite.

I honestly think it means something from a passing word more intended to mean &quot;he really likes it a lot&quot; to the defintion in the dictionaries we read. I think it&#39;s a personal and a family choice. I have heard people say someone is addicted to work or to music or to mazes, believe it or not. I think, from what I have read and talked about with others on the discussion of TV, the issue is the amount of time a person spends in front of it rather than pursuing a hobby or getting enough exercise or spending time with other people or developing a sense of self in quiet. I also believe that interests can happen in spurts for various reasons. Like someone goes through a tv watching period and then gets into a book reading period, or a lego building period and that&#39;s just where they are right then. Again, I think it&#39;s personal and must be decided from person to person and from family to family. I doubt truly, there is any<br/>\n one right or wrong answer here.

On a local hs list, someone wrote in that TV is bad because Waldorf says so.  They gave more detail and some quotes.  Waldorf is believed by many to be an expert on early childhood education, so if Waldorf says TV is bad for young children, it must be so, right?  Wrong.

Or did they just ask some parents if their children were less creative after watching TV, then declare it so?  In Marie Winn&#39;s anti-TV book, she uses parent&#39;s observations as evidence throughout the book.  &quot;Johnny comes home from preschool and stares zombie-like at the TV&quot;.

We didn&#39;t do much as a family, <br/>\nbesides watch TV, but that was because my dad wanted to watch TV. My <br/>\nmom has been wistful that daddy never played cards with her...well, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t remember her taking any of us kids to another area and playing <br/>\ngames. SHE watched, right along with him. Since the parents let <br/>\nthemselves be pulled in, the whole family had TV as a very major <br/>\ncomponent, if not THE major component, of our home life. Of COURSE we <br/>\nhad other things, including camping in the summer and assorted sports <br/>\nand lessons, but as a family, generally, our main activity was TV <br/>\nwatching.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a few years after he retired, Daddy got a lot worse, with him <br/>\nsitting downstairs pretty much all day, watching TV. (sounds sort of <br/>\nlike deschooling, eh?_) then my nephew was born four years ago, who <br/>\nwas the best thing that ever happened for my dad: they adored each <br/>\nother, and he started doing things like cookie baking and coloring <br/>\nand sitting upstairs to visit...between TV shows! He also joined the <br/>\nEagles, which opened up his social life a bit. So, for the last five <br/>\nyears or so of his life, my dad had more than JUST TV, but I&#39;d say <br/>\nfor a lot of his adult life, television viewing was a huge part of <br/>\nhis daily life. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also think he was depression prone, and I know he wasn&#39;t very <br/>\nsocial by nature, which may have added to the absorption in TV. If <br/>\nhe&#39;d been more outgoing, or higher energy, he probably would have had <br/>\nmany more outside interests. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn observing our own family with TV, the kids acted &quot;zombie-like&quot; <br/>\nwhenever we were at a home with TV...we didn&#39;t have cable or <br/>\nsatellite, only videos, for ten years...now that we have satellite, <br/>\nthe kids turn off the TV on their own sometimes. They&#39;re honing their <br/>\ndiscrimination skills, choosing shows they like and KNOWING THE <br/>\nREASONS they like them, and ignoring the shows they don&#39;t like. They <br/>\naren&#39;t addicted, nor are they like zombies. And we watch quite a bit <br/>\nof TV, along with a lot of other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings, HeidiC</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Addiction- esp. to TV","postDate":"1108664921","msgId":103549,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc1MDNEQzYwLjEwNjBGMjAxLjBDOEQ0NUE4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103546,"nextInTopic":103551,"prevInTime":103548,"nextInTime":103550,"topicId":103479,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-= Waldorf is believed by many to be an expert on early childhood education,-=- And that s goofy anyway.

I&#39;m used to the other groups I belong to and <br/>\nwe address each other individually at times but the posts are still <br/>\nconsidered open to everyone to read and comment on.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; When a parent says &quot;we think&quot; and &quot;He and I agree&quot; and &quot;to us it <br/>\nwas clear...&quot; and such statements, I wonder whether the child, <br/>\nespecially if he&#39;s pretty young, is not just agreeing with his mom, <br/>\nor if the mom is assuming agreement, and then assuming that the <br/>\nchild agrees in all ways. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Is this to say that people cannot used the word &quot;we&quot; when it <br/>\ncomes to thinking alike? Cannot people be in agreement with one <br/>\nanother? There are certainly many, many areas my son and I do not <br/>\nagree on. Many times there are some really excellent debates that <br/>\nhappen in this house (exhausting though, as they can be). They are <br/>\nwonderful when they happen. It is encouraged in our house to <br/>\nexplore, find out what is right for yourself, but always, always <br/>\ntalk with each other about it. Debate it and then, still the final <br/>\ndecision is made on your own. Sometimes we agree on certain things <br/>\nbut for totally different reasons. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that if begin  to become afraid of things said <br/>\nlike &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, etc... it may be splitting hairs over minor <br/>\ndetails. I&#39;m not talking about a major organization assuming to <br/>\nspeak for thousands (or even twenty) employees. I&#39;m talking about a <br/>\nfamily that sits down once per week to have heart to hearts and find <br/>\nout what is going on in each others minds and hearts. All is said on <br/>\none&#39;s mind, no one is allowed to interupt or make their opinions <br/>\nknown until it all said and done... and then when the opinions are <br/>\nto be made, it is clear whose opinion it is. Discussion and <br/>\nunderstanding of one another is something we hold dear in this house <br/>\nand while he pursues vary different religious ideas and social ideas <br/>\nthan I do (which can cause an amazing amount of drive time to <br/>\nvarious places on certain days of the week), there is total respect <br/>\nand curiousity for each others beliefs and ideas. We don&#39;t feel <br/>\nthreatened to disagree or agree. It has always been that way for us <br/>\nand will continue to be so long as we&#39;re open to each other and open <br/>\nto hearing the ideas of each other and other people around us. It <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean we will agree... a lot of times we don&#39;t... but it does <br/>\nmean healthy debate, growth (even if painful) and challenge. We is <br/>\njust a way of saying more than one person as is &quot;us&quot; or &quot;he and I&quot;. <br/>\nI&#39;m sure you all must have moments of agreement with your families. <br/>\nI&#39;m sure of it. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-We found ourselves, a lot of times, just sitting and <br/>\n&gt; laughing, talking a little on the comercials, and then when it was <br/>\n&gt; over, we had spent that time not interacting with one another <br/>\nbut . . .=<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But you had a shared experience, a happy experience, and that IS <br/>\ninteraction.  And for years to come you can connect other ideas, <br/>\nstatements, music, visuals or moral questions to that movie or show <br/>\nyou had seen.  The way people build their own internal grid of <br/>\ninformation is to compare and contrast and connect and remember all <br/>\nkinds of things in relationship to other things.  Analogies and <br/>\nhistorical context depend on people having shared experiences, <br/>\nwhether literature, art, music/lyrics, humor, characters (Jung&#39;s <br/>\narchetypes, which are in fairy tales but in other movies and stories <br/>\ntoo)...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n*** Yes, this is true. But we share more fun and what &quot;I&quot; consider <br/>\nmore meaningful interaction when we do other things than watch TV. <br/>\nYes, it is interaction and yes we do discuss things afterwards. It&#39;s <br/>\njust that my choice, and from what he tells me and shows me by his <br/>\ndaily actions, his choice is that he prefers our books, bike ride <br/>\nconversations and other times because we talk more intensly, hash <br/>\nthings out and argue over, even, compared to when watching the <br/>\ntelevision set. <br/>\nOh and definately, we all make connections between the relationship <br/>\nof various life situations/circumstances/people/ideas/ from a wide <br/>\nvariety of sources. Absolutely. And some people, including my son, <br/>\nare more visual thinkers. I am too. I think in pictures. My son gets <br/>\ninspiration from several sources and some of it has been tv and <br/>\nmovies. So have I. Just because in our home the tv is on very little <br/>\nand we only see movies occassionally doesn&#39;t mean we are void of it <br/>\ncompletely. We just use the tv and movies less than we use other <br/>\nsources. We do see plays, musicals, and concerts. We use those. Like <br/>\nwe saw the play about the Delany sisters, &quot;Having Our Say&quot;. It was <br/>\nincredible. We read their books as well. We use a lot of music, art, <br/>\ntons of humor, and story telling in our daily lives.  <br/>\n&gt; -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor us it&#39;s a different type of thing that happens with books. We <br/>\n&gt; read to each other. That to us feels like participation. I&#39;m not <br/>\n&gt; saying that is how it works for other people. I&#39;m sure lots of <br/>\n&gt; people can get that from TV, but we don&#39;t.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some people are more visual than others, but movies are not just <br/>\nvisual.  They accommodate several &quot;learning styles&quot; and use many <br/>\nstimuli at once.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-When we watch a movie <br/>\n&gt; together, we have a good time. It&#39;s our time to escape for a <br/>\nlittle <br/>\n&gt; while and watch someone else, but we can&#39;t do it often . . .=<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not &quot;escape&quot; if you&#39;re still there, together in your house, <br/>\nis it?  And if it&#39;s a good time AND there are things to learn, I <br/>\ncan&#39;t see why it should be considered a thing to be avoided.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** I didn&#39;t mean &quot;escape&quot; in the sense that we are unaware of each <br/>\nother sitting beside or across from one another. We are <br/>\ndefinately &quot;there&quot;. We just usually watch movies as a form of <br/>\nentertainment with the understanding that Hollywood, Disney and such <br/>\nhave some very different ideas of what actually happens or happened <br/>\nin the lives of the people they may be about. When we read the <br/>\nautobiographies, it is fantastic to see the reality in the <br/>\nsituations. These bigger than life depictions of people&#39;s lives are <br/>\nfun, are sometimes profound and do stir up some conversation, but <br/>\nwhen it comes to really understanding something or someone, I <br/>\nbelieve it takes a lot more than a show. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf that is what I am conveying to my son, that&#39;s okay. Because, if <br/>\nyou live around people, you convey messages to them all the time. <br/>\nAnd each person has ideals, has values, and an ethical system by <br/>\nwhich they operate. If my son didn&#39;t agree with me, I can tell you <br/>\nfor sure, I&#39;d be the first one to know in no uncertain terms. He&#39;s <br/>\nquite vocal and doesn&#39;t let folks, not even Mom, tell him what to <br/>\nthink. He might consider something, but he won&#39;t make it part of his <br/>\nphilosophy on life if it doesn&#39;t fit him. Hense the video games and <br/>\nvideo game design class. He wanted it, I don&#39;t like video games all <br/>\nthat much... well, too bad, Mom. I do. Cool. It&#39;s yours. When I say <br/>\nwe agree on something, I actually mean, we. If it wasn&#39;t we, I&#39;d <br/>\nknow it and so would he. He&#39;s got Asperger&#39;s Syndrome. If he thinks <br/>\nsomething, he says it point blank to anyone. He&#39;s always honest, <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t understand lies (thank Heavens) and always tells me what he <br/>\nthinks... about everything. I&#39;m sure if someone else in here has an <br/>\nAsperger&#39;s child, they will know what I&#39;m talking about.

But <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s watching tv, then a huge big giant part of our house is sort <br/>\nof &quot;taken up&quot; with noise and visuals and I often feel relegated to my <br/>\nbedroom, to get away from it. If my husband is watching tv and somebody <br/>\nis playing video games in our bedroom, then I&#39;ve even been known to go <br/>\nsit in the car to get away from the noise for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a function of the set-up of our house and we&#39;re going to take <br/>\ncare of that by remodeling, one of these days. But, anyway, it is a <br/>\nconsideration - tv watching and video game playing can impose a burden <br/>\non others who aren&#39;t watching or playing - they are visually bright and <br/>\ndistracting and the noise can be annoying and intrusive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is one of those things that families have to work out. But we can&#39;t <br/>\nlive in our house with a default that everybody watches tv, plays video <br/>\ngames, and listens to music whenever they feel like it for themselves, <br/>\nnot thinking of other people&#39;s comfort levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoxana and I are the ones who want far more quiet - we would like to <br/>\nsit in the living room with the rest of our family, reading a book, <br/>\ntalking, playing a game, doing other things, without the tv going, far <br/>\nmore often than we get right now. I&#39;d like to sit there without music <br/>\ngoing, sometimes at least. I&#39;m often on overload from the noise level <br/>\nbecause I live in a family where any moment of silence (no tv, no <br/>\nstereo, no video games) seems to be immediately filled by someone <br/>\nsinging at the top of their voice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not concerned about &quot;too much tv&quot; because I think it is bad for my <br/>\nkids - we&#39;re way beyond that kind of thinking - they watch tv like they <br/>\nread - for all kinds of reasons - fun and enjoyment, learning, to veg <br/>\nout, to be stimulated - all KINDS of reasons, all perfectly valid.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I do think it has other impacts on a household and there are things <br/>\nto learn in terms of being considerate and thoughtful about it&#39;s impact <br/>\non other people and on the overall atmosphere of the home. I&#39;ve been in <br/>\nhomes where everybody just does everything with a tv going - cartoons <br/>\nblasting, a talk show going, whatever - and they just have it on and <br/>\ncarry on with life. I can&#39;t do that, myself. I can&#39;t keep my <br/>\nconcentration, it is a struggle, and my brain gets tired.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone who hasn&#39;t had tv for most of a child&#39;s life, and suddenly gets <br/>\nit, will not have learned how to handle it and I could see why they&#39;d <br/>\njust give up and get rid of it.

On a local hs list, someone wrote in that TV is bad because Waldorf says so.  They gave more detail and some quotes.  Waldorf is believed by many to be an expert on early childhood education, so if Waldorf says TV is bad for young children, it must be so, right?  Wrong.  This is the fallacy of the expert - using a well known name to back up something being true.  Just because Waldorf has theories about early child ed, it doesn&#39;t mean that they are experts on technology and its impact on children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe poster also said that (according to Waldorf) TV/video decreases creativity in children.  Where is there ANY evidence of decreased creativity?  How do we measure creativity?  Were there studies?  If so, were they valid?  Was there a control group?  Was the effect long term?  Or did they just ask some parents if their children were less creative after watching TV, then declare it so?  In Marie Winn&#39;s anti-TV book, she uses parent&#39;s observations as evidence throughout the book.  &quot;Johnny comes home from preschool and stares zombie-like at the TV&quot;.  Well, gee, there&#39;s *proof* that TV turns kids into zombies!  If the child spent hours in the sandbox or reading, you can bet those parents would not be saying that sandboxes and books turn kids into zombies.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Response to Sandra on tv/video game addiction post","postDate":"1108659503","msgId":103543,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc0MjE3Q0VGLjU0MTJDOEU0LjBDOEQ0NUE4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103533,"nextInTopic":103545,"prevInTime":103542,"nextInTime":103544,"topicId":103479,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Responses should be to all readers of the list, not to individuals.

The underlying<br/>\nprinciple is how we treat each other. How we can respectfully handle<br/>\nsituations when our wants clash with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the whole family has mutually decided, without the kids being pressured<br/>\nby the parents to make the &quot;right&quot; decision, that they don&#39;t want TV, then<br/>\nthey&#39;re respecting each other in a decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the parents decide they don&#39;t want TV for the family, then the parents<br/>\nwants are overriding the children&#39;s.

They are a symptom -- or self-medication.<br/>\nEliminating the symptom or solution doesn&#39;t make the problem go away.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it doesn&#39;t seem right to treat two things as the same thing -- like<br/>\nalcohol and video games -- then it&#39;s helpful to see their differences and<br/>\ntheir similarities to other things we may see in a more positive light --<br/>\nlike reading and video games.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When we took the tv out of our home (we went without tv for six years) we both<br/>\n&gt; went through a huge adjustment period. ...

No matter how right it feels to<br/>\none person, imposing a solution on others never feels respectful. How would<br/>\nit feel if the kids decided the family should be pursuing more creative<br/>\noutlets so no more reading books. And so they gave away all your books even<br/>\nthe ones you were right in the middle of, threw out your library card and<br/>\nforbid you to read feeling you should be doing something more creative with<br/>\nyour time like writing your own book?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe focus on this list is on finding ways to have closer happier family<br/>\nlives *without* imposing a parent chosen solution, e.g., get rid of the TV.<br/>\nHow to have happier lives while respecting everyone&#39;s -- not just the mom&#39;s<br/>\nor the dad&#39;s -- wants and needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But then we started reading more and together every night and throughout the<br/>\n&gt; day, biking, playing games, talking, drawing,coming up with creative ways to<br/>\n&gt; spend our time, and spend time in solitude to think/meditate, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are ways to get to that without throwing out the TV.

I&#39;ve got <br/>\nsome health problems that mean I may not have a lot of days that I <br/>\nwill be well on, so spending those times with him in talk and <br/>\ninteraction is important to me. Even before I got diagnosed with all <br/>\nthis, it was just important to us. Like I said, it&#39;s not for <br/>\neverybody and it shouldn&#39;t have to be. For us, we have quiet book <br/>\ntime when he&#39;s engrosed in a book he loves and I&#39;m into one I love <br/>\nand then we have one we pick out together and read and talk our way <br/>\nthrough. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -=-My son is taking a video game programming class and one of the <br/>\nthings written about in the manual is to make sure that you make the <br/>\ngame &quot;addictive&quot;.

Good point. That&#39;s true. And what interests <br/>\nsomeone in a book certainly would not interest everyone. I read some <br/>\nterribly boring books according to my son. It&#39;s a matter of tastes. <br/>\nMy friend thinks the books I like are just terribly boring as well. <br/>\nI would never read the books she reads, I&#39;ve got no interest in <br/>\nthem. But for her they are exciting, just as for me, the books I <br/>\nread are exciting. No two people can be exactly alike, nor can any <br/>\ntwo families. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-They are exciting, fun, and what he has told me, that is <br/>\naddicting. He actually says that the high action and the suspense <br/>\nand thrill of the game is addicting to him.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Perhaps you took my statement about my son as a statement meant <br/>\nto cover all. That was not my intention. Sorry if it sounded like <br/>\nthat. Like I said, I was just sharing what we have found for our <br/>\nfamily and what works for us as a family. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you say is true about alcoholism. It is a chemical dependency. <br/>\nMy friend&#39;s husband is a police officer. He worked in a high crime <br/>\narea for a while. While he was there, he grew very attached to the <br/>\njob. Both because he was doing good for people in the area, but also <br/>\nbecause he was getting a rush out of it. When he talked to his <br/>\nfellow officers, they all admitted that there is a definate rush and <br/>\nthrill in the job. Most folks become police to do good. I doubt any <br/>\nof them got into it because it&#39;s a total thrill, because mostly, <br/>\nit&#39;s not. But put into those situations repeatedly, I guess, <br/>\nproduced a rush for these guys. Like climbing a mountain. That is a <br/>\nchemical release. A person&#39;s adrenaline rises up and that&#39;s very <br/>\naddicting. Does that make it bad? No, not necessarily. It depends on <br/>\nhow each individual handles it. I never took my son&#39;s games away <br/>\nfrom him... I won&#39;t, either. We all have the things we enjoy and <br/>\nlike for whatever reasons. Addiction might mean something very <br/>\nnegative to many people. And if addiction is habit according to my <br/>\ndictionary (addict), then what is to say that any one habit is all <br/>\ngood or all bad? It&#39;s what a person does with it. That is to say, <br/>\nhow we define addiction and how we use the word has become a major <br/>\nbuzz word/cover all word for a lot of us. Me included. But what I <br/>\nknow of human chemistry and the body, when we do something, <br/>\nchemicals are released in reaction to the things we do. That&#39;s just <br/>\nhow we work. Addiction or function? Does anyone really know?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just because he says it doesn&#39;t make it so.  Alcoholism is <br/>\naddiction.  It&#39;s not high action and suspense and thrill.  Cocaine <br/>\nis addiction.  They get suspense and thrill, but it involves debts <br/>\nto dealers and horrible friends you can&#39;t get rid of and paranoia <br/>\nand the threat of prison.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Something fun like a video game can be a hobby, an interest, an <br/>\nobsession, but it&#39;s not an addiction in a physical way.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Yes, I agree. I think it can definatly be that way. For me and <br/>\nfor my son, we judge it by how much time he wants to spend on it. If <br/>\nit turns into hours at a time, something isn&#39;t quite in the right. <br/>\nNot because he&#39;s spent time doing something he loves, but because he <br/>\nbecomes a bit more aggitated, irritated, and even gets a stomach <br/>\nache and because we both feel like we missed out on thing. He often <br/>\nsays he wishes he&#39;d done this or that instead of playing the game <br/>\nall that time. He has difficulty figuring time into things, but <br/>\nthat&#39;s another story. Anyway, That is our take on it for ourselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend&#39;s son plays video games from the time he gets home to the <br/>\ntime he goes to bed. He loves it. He doesn&#39;t spend much time with <br/>\nthe family except at dinner. That is worrisome to her, but her son <br/>\nthinks it&#39;s fine so she lets him. That&#39;s his decision. He&#39;s 17 and <br/>\nhe&#39;s old enough to decide what is best for him. He enjoys it.  My <br/>\nson is 12 and we discuss his views of these things and what it means <br/>\nto him and what he finds it meaning to our family. Then we go from <br/>\nthere. Each person is different. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-It provides the excitment he&#39;s looking for instead of just <br/>\nplain old daily life. He says it gives him a fun place to escape to <br/>\nwhen life is boring. Whether that can be deemed as bad or not is a <br/>\npersonal decision. To me, that seems sad because life isn&#39;t boring.-<br/>\n=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Those games ARE part of his life.  If the game is more interesting <br/>\nthan what you were offering as an alternative, will you take the <br/>\ngame away to make your ideas more interesting?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n***Those games are certainly part of his life. I wouldn&#39;t take them <br/>\naway, like I said before. I would never take things from my son&#39;s <br/>\nlife because I want him interested in my things. That&#39; would be <br/>\ncruel. The TV was a family decision. Games he loves, he keeps. <br/>\nHowever, when they interfere with chores, dinner time, and other <br/>\nimportant aspects of the day, i do say something. There does need to <br/>\nbe a limit. It is just he and I and there are responsibilities. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I can provide him right now is limited since I spend time in <br/>\nand out of hospitals and doctors offices for tests and such. If I <br/>\ncould offer all the things I once did for him I would. But being a <br/>\nsingle mother with several illnesses has really cramped our lives <br/>\nfor the time being. My ideas should not be my son&#39;s. They are mine. <br/>\nHowever, we learn from each other. Just like I signed him up for his <br/>\nvideo game design class because he wanted it and he was excited <br/>\nabout it. I don&#39;t regret it one bit. It&#39;s been wonderful for him. <br/>\nHe&#39;s happy. He lets me sit with him and teaches me what he&#39;s been <br/>\nlearning. He shows me the ropes. That&#39;s a lot of fun for us both. <br/>\nBut he&#39;s also happy doing other things when I&#39;m more healthy and we <br/>\nboth look forward to it. That doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s giving up his games. <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t do that to him. I think you may have misunderstood what I <br/>\nwas trying to say. I think my son will probably grow up and be a <br/>\nwonderful game designer. I think he&#39;ll also be a cartoonist because <br/>\nthose are the two things he longs to do. So I would never take that <br/>\naway from him. He&#39;s fantastic at both. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -=-But being so used to playing these exciting, fast paced games <br/>\nsince he was only seven years old, has caused in him a &quot;dependency&quot; <br/>\non this type of<br/>\n&gt; excitement.  -=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I like my husband.  We&#39;ve been together for over 25 years.  I&#39;m <br/>\nused to him.  I&#39;m used to being with him, I&#39;m dependent on him.  I <br/>\nlike him better than not having him.  I like him better than other <br/>\nmen.  That&#39;s not addiction.  That&#39;s making good choices and <br/>\nappreciating what I have, and being grateful for good moments.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** How could love like that be an addiction? You&#39;ve grown to know <br/>\neach other and depend on each other. It&#39;s very important. It&#39;s very <br/>\nhuman. It&#39;s fantastic. You&#39;re blessed in having that. That&#39;s what I <br/>\nlove about having my son in my life. He&#39;s been a wonder to watch <br/>\ngrow and he grows me up daily. He&#39;s the best teacher I have ever <br/>\nknown. I think children are great for that. When I was married, I <br/>\nloved my husband dearly, as well. Being in that type of healthy <br/>\nhuman relationship is not addiction, it is love. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I play guitar.  I like to.

Sometimes <br/>\nit&#39;s for a half an hour, sometimes it&#39;s for two hours. Sometimes I <br/>\nlike to read for 15 minutes or sometimes I read for four hours if my <br/>\neyes can hold out. Those things are not bad and I never said they <br/>\nare. I said it&#39;s personal choice and loving to do something isn&#39;t <br/>\nwrong. Again, I was refering to what my son and I have found to be <br/>\ntrue for ourselves and our family. What works best for us. Everyone <br/>\nis different.

These are just my personal convictions based on my relationship with my son and our personal experiences. I know most people wouldn&#39;t agree with this nor should they have to. <br/>\n <br/>\nFirst, An addiction is anything that creates a dependency in the person participating in the action. Like gambling. It becomes a compulsive, obsessional act, often used to get away from boredom, depression, life situations that don&#39;t provide positive/negative responses someone likes to receive. In the dictionary it says: &quot;addict: to devote or surrendor (oneself) to something habitually or obsessively.&quot; So it is habit forming which is defined as an addiction. Just like biting nails can just keep on going on because you do it so much without thought. That&#39;s what the danger is supposed to be. It&#39;s done without really thinking about it. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen we took the tv out of our home (we went without tv for six years) we both went through a huge adjustment period. It was really tough. What do we do with our time? What do we talk about? I miss this show or that show. But then we started reading more and together every night and throughout the day, biking, playing games, talking, drawing,coming up with creative ways to spend our time, and spend time in solitude to think/meditate, etc... It was the best thing either of us ever did. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister, to be nice, decided to give us cable tv as my birthday present this past year. I just thanked her since she&#39;d prepayed it through to my birthday coming up this year. She thought we were missing out on tv way out here in this boring country setting we have. (it&#39;s not boring... but she&#39;s a city person who can&#39;t imagine living like we do. :-)   Anyway, it&#39;s been okay. We&#39;ve begun watching our favorite shows and spending some time in front of the tv at nights with our dinner instead of at the table. My son said something to me yesterday that pretty much summed up what I had been feeling since before Christmas time. &quot;Mom, I feel like you and I are in the same house but we don&#39;t know each other anymore.&quot; He proceeded to tell me that it&#39;s okay to watch Sponge Bob and Jimmy once in a while, but other than that, it doesn&#39;t seem really worth it to have around. I know my friends all think we&#39;re nuts, but it&#39;s just that we tried it without TV for six years and discovered, that for us,<br/>\n it&#39;s works out better without it. I will miss it. I really will. Especially when I don&#39;t feel much like reading or when my  health is on the outs again. However, when my son said that to me, it solidified the things I had kept to myself all these months. I really missed my son and our special relationship we had developed without the television set.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n My son is taking a video game programming class and one of the things written about in the manual is to make sure that you make the game &quot;addictive&quot;. It has to have qualities in it that people will want to keep coming back to and play again and again. Anything can become addicting. My son loves his games. Always wants to buy more and loves reading the game books. He wants to win another one and win another one. They are exciting, fun, and what he has told me, that is addicting. He actually says that the high action and the suspense and thrill of the game is addicting to him. It provides the excitment he&#39;s looking for instead of just plain old daily life. He says it gives him a fun place to escape to when life is boring. Whether that can be deemed as bad or not is a personal decision. To me, that seems sad because life isn&#39;t boring. But being so used to playing these exciting, fast paced games since he was only seven years old, has caused in him a &quot;dependency&quot; on this type of<br/>\n excitement.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m not out to tell anyone that they shouldn&#39;t watch tv or their children shouldn&#39;t. Or that children shouldn&#39;t play video games. Mine does and is learning how to design them. I think it&#39;s a very personal choice. I just wanted to share what we have found out for ourselves to be true to our family. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!

TV does not create chemical changes in the body.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think kids that are drawn to TV or Nintendo are drawn to it through their natural desires to LEARN.  TV or videogames can seem so magnetic because they have so much action and so much content.  It&#39;s natural for kids to be attracted to things that are rich and stimulating.  Learning should be rich and stimulating and kids are born with a powerful desire to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  I will allow that sugar has a chemical effect and that blood-sugar fluctuations after consuming sugar can create some level of craving for more sugar.
