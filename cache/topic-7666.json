I&#39;m just reading messages on the website <br/>\n- I don&#39;t have time to get everything yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nNEwayz, my son and I are going to try to make soap.  But, I do not <br/>\nhave access to any books on soap making (I can&#39;t read Japanese very <br/>\nwell - and they don&#39;t have any soap making books in English at the <br/>\nlibrary), and we can&#39;t order anything on the web without paying $50+- <br/>\nfor shipping - which takes about a month anywayz.  SO, I know the <br/>\nbasics - like add lye to heated vegetable oil (I think I&#39;ll use <br/>\ngrapeseed) and when it starts to thicken, add fragrance (I&#39;m going to <br/>\nuse a few essential oils), but I don&#39;t know how much to add, and hear <br/>\nthat could be dangerous.  So, if anyone knows the details - have <br/>\nexperience with adding essential oils, etc. please e-mail me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelanie in Japan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7691,"nextTopicId":7693}}
