We&#39;ve been unschooling over two years, We haven&#39;t <br/>\ndone anything remotely like school.  My older son is 18, we consider <br/>\nhim &quot;graduated&quot; but he chose this computer repair course as a way to <br/>\npossible make money in the future.  I ordered this course for my 13 <br/>\nyear old last month and it has just sat here on the table.  I haven&#39;t <br/>\nsaid anything to him, nothing has happened, there has been no <br/>\ndisaster, we&#39;ve had no conflict, I was just asking some simple <br/>\nwhat-if type questions about why he possibly hasn&#39;t done anything <br/>\nwith it yet.  Last night I went to bed feeling really crappy like I <br/>\nwas a failure, and today I got up realizing that really our <br/>\nlives are very pleasant and lovely.  We DON&#39;T argue about chores, or <br/>\nanything else.  My kids know they are free to do whatever they want. <br/>\nI feel some simple questions about responsibility have gotten blown <br/>\nout of proportion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate your responses, and am sorry to have troubled you.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"another response that was bounced (we&#39;ll catch up)","postDate":"1062382842","msgId":79642,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwOC4yNjQ1NjNlNS4yYzg0MDZmYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":79654,"prevInTime":79641,"nextInTime":79643,"topicId":79642,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/31/03 4:47:42 PM, adonai@sirinet.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-294851204\">In a message dated 8/31/03 4:47:42 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:adonai@...\">adonai@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; So it&#39;s ok for him to have a responsibility to others, but not OK <br/>\nfor him to have a responsibility to ME?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;This is just making me crazy? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCan&#39;t you just read it and think about it a day or two without always coming <br/>\nback and seeming to accuse us of something?
