I <br/>\nfelt that the first year was our deschooling year (course didn&#39;t feel that <br/>\nway at begining of year).  We are just finishing up our second year.  My 11 <br/>\nyear old, will take her testing next week.  She was in public school through <br/>\n4th grade; so she is use to that kind of test.  As you know in WA state, we <br/>\nare required to test but don&#39;t have to show it to anyone.  So the testing <br/>\nwill be used by me to see how she is doing.  I&#39;m kinda wishy washy on <br/>\ntesting...but she is gearing up towards getting more acedemic in her studies <br/>\nand has a strong desire to keep more records for college.  So this is yet <br/>\nantoher thing to put in her records.  To be honest, I am not worried about <br/>\nher at all.....she has always been ahead and loves to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow with my 7 year old, he has never been in school.  He is still &quot;underage&quot; <br/>\nof testing requirement.  I have a feeling when he is of age, I will go more <br/>\nof a assesment route for him till he older.<br/>\n<br/>\nCourse this is how I feel this year. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ndoes this answer your questions?<br/>\nChristina, in WA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103,"nextTopicId":108}}
