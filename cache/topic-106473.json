I <br/>\nhave more to pour out still, but sitting down and detailing the events of <br/>\nhis illness and death (he got sick on October 18, and died on November <br/>\n5...three weeks) and crying my eyes out over the death, and the bits of <br/>\nlife, helped tremendously.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, HeidiC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Message: 16<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 7 Jun 2005 01:41:57 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dezigna@...\">dezigna@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: RE: Need help/advice for someone I don&#39;t really know at all<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am involved in a cancer-related e-board and a woman<br/>\n&gt;whose mother died 7 weeks ago has begun posting about<br/>\n&gt;her 16 year-old son who has started cutting school. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am sure that parents of teens will have better suggestions for her and <br/>\n&gt;her<br/>\n&gt;son than I will have - or better ways of expressing the idea of letting him<br/>\n&gt;be and letting him also mourn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;However as someone whose mother died of cancer this last January I do have <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;suggestion that helped me with my mourning. I felt very &quot;blocked&quot; and heavy<br/>\n&gt;and was having trouble thinking or communicating clearly - either on line <br/>\n&gt;or<br/>\n&gt;to the people in my life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I found that I gained great sense of relief and release by sitting down for<br/>\n&gt;a long uninterrupted session with my laptop and writing all I could <br/>\n&gt;remember<br/>\n&gt;about my mother&#39;s life and my own childhood with her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In my case it was a process of getting rid of a lot of negativity and<br/>\n&gt;releasing anger and resentments. However recording joys and recollections <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;closeness might also be as freeing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For me it was a case of getting this stuff out of my head, and onto <br/>\n&gt;&quot;paper&quot;,<br/>\n&gt;so that my thinking was released - my brain ceased feeling like it was<br/>\n&gt;stuffed with marshmallow the second I hit the final period. I was able to<br/>\n&gt;start talking to others, and thinking logically again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If this lady is mourning and is as blocked as I was, she may be relying on<br/>\n&gt;old routines and conventions to help her feel secure. She may be simply<br/>\n&gt;unable, yet, to accept new ideas of any sort. Her son needs his time to<br/>\n&gt;mourn also, including being angry and going through a period of questioning<br/>\n&gt;or feeling everything is &quot;pointless&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If she is trying to force him to be &quot;normal&quot; because of her need for<br/>\n&gt;normalcy, his mourning may last longer (like short circuiting deschooling<br/>\n&gt;with &quot;suggestions&quot;). I think he will fight for autonomy because of his need<br/>\n&gt;to mourn in his own way. However perhaps they both feel if they can just<br/>\n&gt;hold on in their different ways until the summer break, that may provide an<br/>\n&gt;anticipated and comfortable change in routine that will let them both mourn<br/>\n&gt;fully.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Robyn L.
