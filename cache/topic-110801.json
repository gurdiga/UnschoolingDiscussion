At the time we were more eclectic or relaxed home schoolers.  It is actually my seeking the best way to meet their needs that led us to find unschooling.  It has been an absolute thrill to find out how wonderful it is for ALL of my children.  I credit unschooling for being the reason my birth children have developed such a great sibling relationship with the children we adopted.<br/>\n  One of the things that has really become true for our family is that we have five kids.  Some are biological, some are adopted.  I just can&#39;t seem to remember which is which.<br/>\n  It took some time to get to that place.  While it&#39;s definitely not magic, unschooling is a huge help.  One thing to be aware of, if you are adopting out of foster care or institutionalized care, I found I needed to go slow.  They were accustomed to rigid routines and seemed to find a certain amount of security in a predictable environment.  I had to go slow or they would seem to think mom and dad don&#39;t care what we do.  I had to transform that thinking into mom and dad care deeply, but you get to choose.  It took time for them to be able to choose without it causing frustration.  They also needed to test to see if we really were interested in what they care about.  It took them a lot of time to find out who they are.  To a certain extent, they needed a chance to lean how to play.
