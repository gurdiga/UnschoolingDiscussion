With school out of the way,<br/>\ncontrol out of the way, and love and mutual respect in the forefront, my<br/>\nworld is pretty cool, too.<br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t &#39;have to&#39; do anything, but be grateful!<br/>\nAloha, Lee<br/>\n<br/>\nNORTH COUNTRY FARMS<br/>\n~an eco-tourism destination~<br/>\nP.O.
