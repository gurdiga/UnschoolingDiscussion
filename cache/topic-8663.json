If you don&#39;t mind, could you<br/>\n&gt; explain what it was your child was diagnosed with?  I have a very strong<br/>\n&gt; willed son, and  he has always been very sensitive from day one, too.  What<br/>\n&gt; is OCD?  I know what tourettes is.  How was his anxiety disorder diagnosed?<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve always thought  my son to be exactly as your  book describes: intense,<br/>\n&gt; sensitive, perceptive, persistent, and energetic.   Since he is adopted, I am<br/>\n&gt; not sure of all possible things he may have a predisposition for, but he does<br/>\n&gt; seem to improving behaviorally as refined sugars are being eliminated from<br/>\n&gt; his diet.  One thing I have noticed is that he is sleeping better, and not<br/>\n&gt; getting up quite as early, which is good as he often gets so tired by mid<br/>\n&gt; day.  He can be very shy, but at the same time, very controlling.  He is very<br/>\n&gt; loving and sensitive, but also has a fiery temper and will launch himself<br/>\n&gt; into a tantrum  over seemingly trivial things.  He is very intense!  Well, I<br/>\n&gt; look forward to hearing from you.

If you don&#39;t mind, could you <br/>\nexplain what it was your child was diagnosed with?  I have a very strong <br/>\nwilled son, and  he has always been very sensitive from day one, too.  What <br/>\nis OCD?  I know what tourettes is.  How was his anxiety disorder diagnosed?  <br/>\nI&#39;ve always thought  my son to be exactly as your  book describes: intense, <br/>\nsensitive, perceptive, persistent, and energetic.   Since he is adopted, I am <br/>\nnot sure of all possible things he may have a predisposition for, but he does <br/>\nseem to improving behaviorally as refined sugars are being eliminated from <br/>\nhis diet.  One thing I have noticed is that he is sleeping better, and not <br/>\ngetting up quite as early, which is good as he often gets so tired by mid <br/>\nday.  He can be very shy, but at the same time, very controlling.  He is very <br/>\nloving and sensitive, but also has a fiery temper and will launch himself <br/>\ninto a tantrum  over seemingly trivial things.  He is very intense!

I&#39;ve been reading David<br/>\n&gt; Albert&#39;s &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My daughter (age 10 and a huge Harry Potter fan) and I just finished<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Castle in the Attic,&quot; and have started &quot;Wizard&#39;s Hall&quot; (the storyline<br/>\n&gt; of this one sounds very similar to Harry Potter, but it was actually<br/>\n&gt; written first).  She also just finished (after having only just<br/>\n&gt; received) book #21 of the Magic Treehouse series, &quot;Civil War on<br/>\n&gt; Sunday.&quot;  She also just read the first of the Magic School Bus chapter<br/>\n&gt; books, &quot;The Truth About Bats.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On my summer reading list is Scott Turow&#39;s &quot;Personal Injuries,&quot; Mary<br/>\n&gt; Hood &quot;Joyful Homeschooler,&quot; and &quot;Strong Willed Child or Dreamer&quot; by<br/>\n&gt; Dr. Dana Scott Spears.  And of course, Harry Potter #4 when it comes<br/>\n&gt; out!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Robin<br/>\n&gt; Orlando, FL<br/>\n&gt;  :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To Unsubscribe: mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8792,"nextTopicId":8809}}
