If you&#39;re not too busy, could you help me with the transition. <br/>\nThis is what I&#39;m dealing with.  I&#39;ve tried just about every curriculum<br/>\nthat&#39;s out there.  I&#39;m fed up with curriculum.  Right now, I have my<br/>\n12yodd reading A History of the US, any Science book from the library of<br/>\nher choosing, Sonlight&#39;s Tom Sawyer and a literature guide for Reading,<br/>\nSpelling Power, Key to Decimals and a grammar workbook.  She just doesn&#39;t<br/>\nget grammar and never has.  She hates to read.  If I will leave her<br/>\nalone, she will read other stuff, but not what I would like for her to<br/>\nread.  When we go to the library, she picks out books on softball,<br/>\nsnakes, etc.  She will read those with no problems.  Should I just let<br/>\nher read her own thing and still have her do spelling, grammar and math<br/>\nor what?   I really need your advice.  My 8yodd is doing Explode the<br/>\nCode, but gets very frustrated when she can&#39;t read the words.  I don&#39;t<br/>\npress her to read, but she will on her own, maybe once every two weeks. <br/>\nI don&#39;t push her to do math, but she likes to do a math program on the<br/>\ncomputer, along with other games.  I do have her write a sentence every<br/>\nday.  I&#39;m not really sure why I do this.  She seems to be a perfect<br/>\ncandidate for unschooling.  My 6yodd is not interested in learning to<br/>\nread or anything else right now.  She likes to do worksheets though.  I<br/>\nhate them.  I have a hard time finding the sheets, when she can&#39;t read. <br/>\nShe just doesn&#39;t get phonics, so I figured that she just wasn&#39;t ready. <br/>\nShe also likes to do computer games.  I like to do unit studies, but<br/>\nthere&#39;s so much work involved in these, that I just don&#39;t want to take<br/>\nthe time to do them.  I really want to do unschooling, but I&#39;m so afraid<br/>\nthat the girls won&#39;t be learning anything or will want to watch tv all<br/>\nday.  Only the oldest one does that the most.  She is interested in<br/>\nbeauty school and can start this when she is 16, but what do I do in the<br/>\nmeantime?  I just need some help.  Please give me some advice.  Am I<br/>\ndoing something wrong?<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n[end of quote]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102789,"nextTopicId":103125}}
