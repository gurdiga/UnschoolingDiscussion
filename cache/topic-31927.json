I actually like her.  she<br/>\n&gt; funny and easy to talk to.  I do know that she doesn&#39;t enjoy being<br/>\n&gt; with her kids, without having *something* to do.  She has told me<br/>\n&gt; that, they drive her crazy if they aren&#39;t doing an activity or have a<br/>\n&gt; friend over.<br/>\n&gt; Joanna<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You know,  I wonder if the not enjoying being with her children could be<br/>\ncorrelated with the number of outside activities they are involved in.  What<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking of is my oldest dd.....who almost only &#39;acts out&#39;  or allows<br/>\nher negative emotions,  whining, etc.  out at home...or with our family<br/>\nmembers.  I&#39;m wondering if the kids are less enjoyable since the time they<br/>\ndo get with mom is time they need to &#39;let loose&#39; ...making it more<br/>\nstressful.<br/>\n    And I do wonder if it&#39;s some type of escapism...from herself,  from<br/>\nthem,  from &#39;being&#39; instead of always &#39;doing.<br/>\n    I know several people who tend to have what I consider extremely<br/>\nscheduled lives for themselves and their children.  Is it due to some<br/>\nexternal social pressure?  And I do think that moms that do this usually<br/>\nbelieve that what they are doing is &#39;best&#39; for themselves and children....so<br/>\nthay wouldn&#39;t be &#39;bad&#39;;  but I wonder,   could they be mis-informed.  I<br/>\nsuppose it all comes down to the attitude about it....is the mom at peace<br/>\nwith herself and her choices?  Do she and her children thrive on this?  Do<br/>\nthey seem happy and growing in healthy family relationships?<br/>\n    I have a neighbor-friend who tends to keep things<br/>\nactivity-oriented....almost always a play date or organized activity.....one<br/>\nof her reasons is to keep the children out of the house a lot because her<br/>\n*disabled* spouse has very little patience with them and their messes and<br/>\nnoise, etc.<br/>\nGotta go for now,<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31915,"nextTopicId":31937}}
