But Mother Dance isn&#39;t an unschooling or even a<br/>\nhomeschooling book, so we&#39;ll have to excuse her! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think part of the difficulty in this limit setting discussion is that<br/>\nwe don&#39;t have many &quot;natural&quot; limits in our modern society.  200 years<br/>\nago, people couldn&#39;t have ice cream in their freezer (or M&M&#39;s anywhere).<br/>\n In order to have ice cream, you would have to make it (which means you&#39;d<br/>\nhave to get ice from somewhere) and you couldn&#39;t save the leftovers. <br/>\nPeople did not have to choose between eating ice cream or something else.<br/>\n Same with electronic media.  It just wasn&#39;t an option.  And so much work<br/>\nwas involved just in basic food, shelter, etc., that there was less<br/>\nleisure time anyway.  And since most people were physically active just<br/>\nwith basic chores, it didn&#39;t matter if leisure time was spent laying<br/>\nabout.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe as somebody said to those who think their kids spend too much<br/>\ntime electronically, the key is to make sure that there are other<br/>\ninteresting options and model it yourself.  I know that when dd asks to<br/>\nwatch a movie, most of the time she will choose doing something with me<br/>\ninstead, if given the choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, if you can&#39;t beat &#39;em, join &#39;em!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nGain weight...
