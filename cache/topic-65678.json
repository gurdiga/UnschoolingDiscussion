Just to let you know, Sandy, I believe that at least some of the problem with my 14dd has been just that &#39;learned helplessness&#39; from school and from me directing her during earlier homeschooling. Even though we were more relaxed than most people around us, I was always pressuring them to do something &#39;educational&#39;, not fully realizing that they learn from everything and one thing leads to another. Don&#39;t know if this makes sense to you, a good short book on it is Frank Smith&#39;s &#39;Learning and Forgetting&#39;. <br/>\nAnyway, I think the answer with her is to be more &#39;unschooly&#39;, so that&#39;s why I was seeking suggestions here. Someone commented on 14 as an age of &#39;boy craziness&#39;, and that is sooo  happenin&#39; here. Think it&#39;s a big part of the boredom. That makes me feel better, to know it&#39;s more common. It brings back a lot of memories for me but my childhood was so unhappy that I didn&#39;t think of myself as normal. <br/>\nJennifer, we are in the same kind of &#39;no friends for oldest&#39; situation as you. We have tried having her join a mostly unschooling group in a town an hour away, but that didn&#39;t click, either. May try again, though....<br/>\nNancy, thanks for the info about Farley Mowat- we&#39;ll try some more of his books.<br/>\nMary T. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65666,"nextTopicId":65680}}
