He could not go beyond<br/>\n  &gt; the &quot;because I said so&quot; with pre-teens and teens and their discussions. I<br/>\n  &gt; often would, calmly and without any charge, state their case in different<br/>\n  &gt; lingo in the attempt to have him hear them in another way. I was accused of<br/>\n  &gt; siding with them or contradicting him or disempowering him as a father,etc.<br/>\n  &gt; This was not the sole reason for the demise of our marriage, but a factor.<br/>\n  &gt; Yet, even in reflection, I cannot see another way of doing it, without<br/>\n  &gt; compromising my position as my children&#39;s mom and constant supporter and<br/>\n  &gt; defender (even to their dad). <br/>\n<br/>\n  This is sort of what we are going through, but I at least can see that my <br/>\n  husband is TRYING to change, and be more open minded.  We may never see eye to <br/>\n  eye on it, totally, but, and this sounds really sneaky or deceitful, I just have <br/>\n  a way of talking him into things and keeping the peace so it is never <br/>\n  unbearable, and we end up at a compromise.  I have been thanking him and <br/>\n  complimenting him when he&#39;s backed up a bit on a rule that at one time was more rigid.  We <br/>\n  have a way of wanting to please each other, and often that takes the form of <br/>\n  him laying off the kids, or letting them go someplace he usually wouldn&#39;t, to <br/>\n  please me. <br/>\n<br/>\n  On the other hand, at times our older daughter at home (17) can be really <br/>\n  snobby, unkind and rude to us.  (Honest to God, it started when she went to <br/>\n  public school...it&#39;s something we are really struggling with right now) and if she <br/>\n  speaks to my husband like that, or me, we stand together in calling it to her <br/>\n  attention and asking for an apology.  Sometimes one of us will say hurts for <br/>\n  us to hear our spouse treated in that way (hubbies version is usually, &quot;No one <br/>\n  is gonna talk to my wife that way, especially not her own child!&quot;  (He&#39;s <br/>\n  really trying...;o)   <br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Now, this is still an issue between us, as our teens take on life in an<br/>\n  &gt; unstructured and passionate fashion - and DEFINITELY not the prescribed<br/>\n  &gt; traditional regular path.

My husband and I have always been opposites on just about everything.   I earnestly live by that saying:  &quot;G-d grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t change my husband so I do the best I can to support him in front of the kids, but then to explain things to the kids when I&#39;m alone with them.  I don&#39;t undermine my husband&#39;s opinion because I don&#39;t want my kids to pawn us off of each other.  I just try to make his POV more clear to the kids.  They might still disagree, but my hope is it diffuses the resentment that sometimes builds up.  Most of the time, they are just glad to talk about their frustration and it helps them to know that their dad is usually not just being spiteful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then when I&#39;m alone with my husband, I try to explain the kids POV to him so that he can understand where they are coming from.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, all of this depends on timing and moods too.  I have to really pay attention to when the right time is to discuss this stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe thinks I let them get involved in too many activities.  He feels he was not all allowed to get involved in stuff like they are.  (In reality, they aren&#39;t involved in any more than he was.  Its a perceptual thing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ve explained to him that he *did* have all kinds of opportunites *in school*.  Since our kids are not in school, and we unschool, their activities are a large part of them figuring out who they are and what they want to do when they get older.  Their activities are a large part of their education.  He seems to get it when I explain it, but I think his gut reaction is still conditioned to reject that kind of thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he found out I was giving them an allowance and they didn&#39;t necessarily have to help out, I explained that its not required that they help out, but I do ask them to do things, and they do help.  And I also explained that although they are getting a generous allowance, they also have to use it to buy their clothing, etc..(.it makes for a fixed amount in the budget instead of constantly &quot;robbing peter to pay paul&quot;).  And like I said, they are far more careful with money and content with what they have.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont&#39; think he&#39;s convinced, but he&#39;s let it drop :o).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of it is mostly his unrealistic expectations that the kids value his work as much as he does.  For example, when he wants the lawn mowed, he wants it done the way *he* would do it.  He forgets that nobody is perfect and experience takes practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes my role is to facilitate ways to build trust between him and the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, I told hubby I&#39;d mow the lawn for him, could he get the brand new rider out for me.  After he got it out, it occurred to me that ds was bored, why not let ds do it!   Well, hubster is not fond of the idea of letting ds use the brand new rider.  He made ds use push mowers for the longest time before letting him use the OLD rider. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think my husband realized that here we were offering to do work for him that he did not have time to do and he&#39;d be silly to say no.  He also didn&#39;t have the time to argue about it &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it began storming and pouring down rain, ds was wise enough to cover the mower with a large tarp.  I didnt even have to ask him to and he scored a big point with his dad.  But had I not gently suggested it, he never would have had the chance to even use the mower in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther times I&#39;ve told the kids to go out and do some of the stuff that their dad does, just to take the load off of him.  It really helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7527178,"authorName":"CelticFrau@aol.com","from":"CelticFrau@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] peaceful parenting moment","postDate":"1055560316","msgId":74104,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwLjMwNzhhZWEyLjJjMWJlYzdjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":74098,"nextInTopic":74108,"prevInTime":74103,"nextInTime":74105,"topicId":73914,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/13/2003 10:39:59 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

Don&#39;t get me wrong, <br/>\nhe&#39;s not a control freak and doesn&#39;t spank, but it&#39;s very hard getting him to <br/>\nsee that he&#39;s getting himself stressed out about unnecessary bullshit! :o)  <br/>\nYesterday we had a looonnnnggggg conversation about wanting a much more <br/>\npeaceful home, no arguing, much more joy and happiness.  But a couple hours later he <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t let my 17 yo go out with friends &quot;because he said so.&quot;  His brother <br/>\nwas coming for a visit (is here for about 4 days) and that was his reasoning, <br/>\nbut it was very frustrating for me and my daughter.  I&#39;m having a hard time not <br/>\nsiding with them in front of him and having him resent me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re a work in progress, and things are getting much better, just hitting a <br/>\nfew bumps in the road.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"peaceful parenting moment","postDate":"1055473904","msgId":73914,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2QwMWMzMzE1OSRhNWY4YzQyMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDMwNjEyLjE5MTAxMi4xNzkyLjUuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":73917,"prevInTime":73913,"nextInTime":73915,"topicId":73914,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just want to share a peaceful parenting moment, inspired by this list and Sandra s Peaceful Parenting tape. dd had a slurpee from 7-11.

I had thought I was<br/>\neasygoing about food and eating, but conversations here helped me become<br/>\naware of all the ways I WAS controlling their eating.  They are tending to<br/>\neat lots of certain foods, then they seem to have their fill of it, for<br/>\nawhile at least, and want something else instead.  It has been good for me<br/>\ntoo, to eat what I desire.  It is very satisfying!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74170,"nextTopicId":74138}}
