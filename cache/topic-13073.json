I&#39;ve tried letting the neighbor kids<br/>\ninto my home, one on one friend visits and such.  It appeared to work pretty<br/>\nwell with the girl I mentioned, until she began to come over and ask ds to<br/>\nplay outside all the time.  After having had her in my home I thought I&#39;d<br/>\nbuilt up a strong enough relationship with her that I knew her.  Wrong!! I<br/>\nlet them go outside tp play and reminded ds of the rules.  I watched them go<br/>\noutside and follow my admonishments well enough for awhile.  After a half an<br/>\nhour ds returned home to tell me he couldn&#39;t play with her anymore.  I asked<br/>\nwhy, and he said because she can cross the street, play anywhere she wants,<br/>\nswears alot, and plays with the mean kids. This girl is only 6 years old<br/>\n(When I say mean, I mean MEAN.  There&#39;s a 14 year old who has physically<br/>\nassaulted several children in this neighborhood and sexually molested his<br/>\nyounger 9 year old sister-and this is the family of children I try to keep<br/>\nds away from. His little brother is following in his older brother&#39;s<br/>\nfootsteps by physically threatening ds, and stealing toys. The sister who<br/>\nhas been molested lies all the time. All of these kids hang around this<br/>\nlittle girl my ds is so fond of. The neighborhood at large has called the<br/>\npolics and CPS numerous times on the parent of these kids, but nothing has<br/>\nbeen resolved.  The police have told me to continue calling so the *system*<br/>\nwill finally have enough *evidence* to help these kids, although I think for<br/>\nthe 14 year old it&#39;s probably too late. I hope I&#39;m wrong.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWeelll. Hmmm, I thought.  Ds obviously isn&#39;t safe playing outside with this<br/>\ngirl because she completely lacks judgement and has a mother who is<br/>\nincapable of taking care of her daughter correctly.  (The mother is very<br/>\nyoung, a victim of abuse herself, and is living with a boyfriend who was<br/>\nconvicted of sexual assault. I&#39;m certain he&#39;s mentally abusing the mom, if<br/>\nnot physically.)  So I decided to limit ds&#39;s visiting time with this little<br/>\ngirl to only when they are in my yard or my house.  For about a week it<br/>\nseemed to work, but then the girl noticed ds couldn&#39;t go around the<br/>\nneighborhood with her, or go off by themselves, and she stopped coming over.<br/>\nI still say hello to her when I see her, and she asks if ds can come out to<br/>\nplay-I tell her she can come over instead.  She doesn&#39;t come.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the kids are okay-pretty good kids, they get out of hand once in<br/>\nawhile-like yesterday 2 psed boys were chasing ds and a friend on bikes<br/>\nyelling and threatening them.  My dh stepped out and did the old &quot;If you do<br/>\nthat again, I&#39;m calling your parents!&quot; routine.  I hope it worked!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd without all that pack mentality kids get in school, my ds is learning<br/>\neverything he needs about undesireable behavior just fine. Ugh. :-) It&#39;s too<br/>\nbad about these families-the neighborhood is actually a pretty good one.<br/>\nYou can walk around at night and not have to worry-most everybody is on a<br/>\nfirst name basis with the local police-small town mentality-that sort of<br/>\nthing. I sometimes think if this were 100 years ago, the children would have<br/>\nbeen removed from the parent&#39;s influence years ago, and the kids would have<br/>\na decent chance of growing up happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nLee</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"azMfzq60EX8ra3gAFwMKoW46UPcuvHpbZ1BT0-AVW24J-2LmA7aK6IByYQrW01ZzxaezdTS5knWvQdhCu-Md3Z32-Kf02pYApjTi8ORmk2Qy3AjV8A","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] kids friends","postDate":"968805915","msgId":13110,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5QkVEQzJCLjk1NTYuMzMzNUMxRUBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PExQQkJJTURNUEdKQU9MS0JKSUlFT0VMQkNIQUEuc2VhbXVzQHBvcnR1cC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGUyLjk5NmI2MTguMjZlZTM5ZmZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":13103,"nextInTopic":13128,"prevInTime":13109,"nextInTime":13111,"topicId":13073,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Lee, I know this is probably none of my business, but could you make it that your kids can play with these kids, but only at your house?

I grew up in the city, and while, over the years, I did have a couple of friends and a few pleasant acquaintanceships (is that a word?

My brother was my closest playmate often, even though we were in PS.
