Director of Science Research & Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology & <br/>\nDirector of the Cincinnati Museum Center&#39;s Dinosaur Field School in Montana.  He&#39;ll <br/>\nbe training them first, then taking them to their cabins (7000 feet above sea <br/>\nlevel) then to the dig site on the Northwest flank of the Bighorn Mountains <br/>\nof south-central Montana.  At some point during the week they will also be <br/>\ngoing to Yellowstone National Park.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I hear more from her, I&#39;ll let you all know (though, LOL, I doubt I&#39;ll <br/>\nhear from her much; it sounded like she was having just too much fun already--she <br/>\nalready said it&#39;s the most fun she&#39;s had on ANY trip she&#39;s EVER taken, so I <br/>\ntake that as &quot;mom, I won&#39;t be calling you, tehe).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks for thinking of her/us and for all your prayers for a safe <br/>\ntrip out.  I know she&#39;ll be fine, but it&#39;s just a mother&#39;s worry.<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\nWe forfeit three-fouths of ourselves in order to be like other people.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Arthur Schopenhauer~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77900,"nextTopicId":77899}}
