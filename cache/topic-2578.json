Until just a couple of years ago (2.5?), <br/>\nwe met every week with unschoolers and interested parties.   New moms often <br/>\nwanted to talk to the other moms.  I would try to get them to hang out with <br/>\nthe kids instead.  Some got it, some didn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome adults just ignore kids and don&#39;t want kids around, and so the idea of <br/>\nkids not being articulate with adults isn&#39;t always the kids&#39; fault.  School <br/>\ndiscourages direct and real conversations between teachers and kids after a <br/>\nwhile, it seems.  And many families do it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unschooling families where parents listen to their kids and have REAL <br/>\ndiscussions with them regularly are creating a model that I&#39;d never seen <br/>\nbefore, of kids who do not see themselves as separate or smaller or <br/>\nsecondary.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I know exactly what Marjorie&#39;s talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nA homeschooling group here plays Harry Potter once a week (collectible card <br/>\ngame tournaments) at a shop really (coincidently) close to our house.   <br/>\nHolly&#39;s been going for months, and Kirby started going lately.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little boy of nine of ten was saying something about how he learned to read <br/>\nfrom the games, and Kirby said &quot;You know how I learned?  Nintendo Power.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe boy&#39;s mom said, &quot;The reason we homeschool is because I read an article <br/>\nabout how you learned to read.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly told me this story. I could get closer quotes from her, maybe.  She&#39;s <br/>\ngot a great memory.  But Holly says Kirby said &quot;Really?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mom was reassuring him that really, it was reading something I had <br/>\nwritten that caused their family not only to homeschool, but to be <br/>\nunschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby said &quot;I didn&#39;t know we did that for people!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat makes me think Kirby hasn&#39;t been paying any attention for many years. <br/>\n&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\nMore likely, he&#39;s unaware of how different his life is.

She asked me how <br/>\nfar away it was (about 3,000 miles) and how many miles we could drive <br/>\nin a day (around 350) and she began subtracting 350 from 3,000 and then <br/>\n350 from that and so on. She got frustrated because she realized she&#39;d <br/>\nmade a mistake early on and, as I walked by I said, &quot;There is an easier <br/>\nway to do that.&quot; She wanted to know how and I told her she&#39;d have to <br/>\nlet me show her in a view steps. She said, &quot;Okay.&quot; So - I showed her 6 <br/>\ndivided by 2 and then 60 divided by 2 and then 64 divided by 2 and then <br/>\n60 divided by 20 and so on - showed her what to do with remainders and <br/>\nthen said she was ready to do 3,000 divided by 350. So she did it.  <br/>\nTHEN - she said: &quot;WHY did you not ever show me this before? It is so <br/>\ncool.&quot; I said, &quot;It is called &#39;long division,&#39;&quot; and she just couldn&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve it: &quot;Everybody HATES long division but THIS is too cool.&quot; She <br/>\nasked me to give her some more problems to work and I did. This entire <br/>\nprocess took about 30 minutes, max. That was it - she knew how to do it <br/>\n- I&#39;ve seen her use it many times since then (she&#39;s 15).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - a few days ago Rosie (12) said she was bored. I said, &quot;Well - what <br/>\ndo you want to do?&quot; &quot;Hmmm- I want to learn something new like some new <br/>\nmath thing or something.&quot; &quot;Like what?&quot; I asked. &quot;Like - you know that <br/>\ndivision thing where you write all the numbers down in a list or <br/>\nsomething?&quot; &quot;Like long division?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; So - I showed her a few <br/>\nproblems, starting with simple ones. She asked me to give her more <br/>\nproblems to work. She was interested in the remainders - in <br/>\nunderstanding what they meant. So we looked at them as leftovers and as <br/>\nfractions of groups and then I showed her how to deal with remainders <br/>\nusing decimals. Again - the whole thing lasted about 30 minutes. It was <br/>\nfun for both of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - all three of my girls have learned long division. Check that off! <br/>\n&lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, long division is taught when kids are 9 to 10 years old, <br/>\nin school. But my girls naturally seemed to want to learn it at about <br/>\n12. They learned lots of other things before that - lots of statistics <br/>\nideas, for example. Also a lot about decimals and fractions. To be <br/>\nhonest, even though I&#39;m really interested in how kids learn math, I <br/>\ncan&#39;t say that I really know how or when they learned most of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian<br/>\nThe National Home Education Network<br/>\n~The World is Our Classroom~<br/>\nwww.NHEN.org</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy","from":"Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] new to list","postDate":"1045444272","msgId":59194,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFNTAzNkIwLjg2MDlBNUUyQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDYuYTRmMzc4Zi4yYjgxNWFmMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59187,"nextInTopic":59227,"prevInTime":59193,"nextInTime":59195,"topicId":2578,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**The dad has a PhD in engineering.

Especially when everything keeps changing and evolving. <br/>\nBUT...the difference with unschoolers is that we don&#39;t tell our kids that <br/>\nlearning starts &quot;now&quot; and ends &quot;then.&quot; The learning never starts and the <br/>\nlearning never ends. There are no limits to asking another question. There <br/>\nis no shame in not knowing an answer YET.

It worked. It allowed him the time to really think about what he was <br/>\nasking of you and the kids. Of course he couldn&#39;t pin down what *every* 4-5 <br/>\nyear old should know. Each one is different and their abilities and <br/>\ninterests are all over the place. How wonderful of him to realize that. <br/>\nSeems like he even realized that the paper would get buried as far more <br/>\ninteresting learning opportunities come up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;One of his major fears about unschooling is the ability for kids to learn <br/>\n&gt;&gt;self regulating.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To self regulate what?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Another of it is how does a parent &quot;make sure&quot; that their kid is prepared <br/>\n&gt;&gt;for all subjects when thet kid may decide to never explore long division <br/>\n&gt;&gt;while living at home, or some other subject that society deems necessary <br/>\n&gt;&gt;for someone to master by the time they are 18.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why does anyone need to master long division by age 18?

They&#39;re not<br/>\neven official school age yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you let your husband know what happens at your house each day, while he&#39;s<br/>\ngone?  When mine is in the field, I send a daily email with just chatty news<br/>\nof what&#39;s happening at home.  It&#39;s reassuring to him to know what Tim (6<br/>\nyrs) is up to, interested in, etc.  That&#39;s also where I share with him some<br/>\nof the great insights I&#39;ve gotten here.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour husband may not be gone overnight and may not have email, but maybe you<br/>\ncan just journal some notes to share great moments with him that you&#39;d<br/>\notherwise forget. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut my best advice would be to show him how great your kids are doing today,<br/>\nand let tomorrow worry about itself.

However, I just figured <br/>\nthat I would get any ducks I needed to get in a row as time got closer.  It <br/>\nwas never a high priority for me to make the state happy- just my kids :)  I <br/>\ndo know that my school district is very pro homeschool compared to others <br/>\nand so I never thought I would have to really plead my case in huge details <br/>\nto anyone, let  alone dh!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make it clear: he is not against homeschooling at all. He is actually a <br/>\ncertified teacher and has done some subbing in public schools duing tighter <br/>\ntimes.  He knows first hand how damaging the system can be to kids and <br/>\nsupports alternatives to public school whole heartedly.  I think that if we <br/>\nhad the $$$ lying around, he might have given more of a &quot;fight&quot; in favor to <br/>\nsome private school somewhere.  Since this wasn&#39;t an option, it was either <br/>\npublic or home.  That was the easy part of the journey in the early years!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI never labeled my methods as unschooling (I personally don&#39;t like the term, <br/>\nI do prefer something along the lines of &quot;child led learning&quot;).  I just <br/>\nfound that my older daughter was a natural self educator. She has an <br/>\nextremely long attention span for a kid her age, and always has.  She gets <br/>\nexcited to explore so many things and I find myself as deeply involved in er <br/>\n&quot;obsessions&quot; (as we call them around here) as she is. My younger one as <br/>\nstarted getting involved- giving 110% of her small attention and effort to <br/>\nkeeping up.  When dh is home and awake he does get into whatever chaos is <br/>\nhappening:)  I think he issue maybe that he does not see this as learning.  <br/>\nOr, if it is, how can it possibly satisfy some state requirements down the <br/>\nline? OR, yes the girls seem to be picking up all sorts of information now, <br/>\nbut as their brains develop and crave more complex info, how can we provide <br/>\nthis stuff without some kind of plan?  AND, don&#39;t we need some kind of <br/>\npredetermined plan layed out to make sure that we don&#39;t miss anything?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried to patiently explain how all these things are completely <br/>\nirrelevant, especially right now.  He got me so worked up at one point, I <br/>\ntold him that if he was so darn sure we needed a curriculim, he could go <br/>\nahead a write one! Not one of my prouder moments.  He tried and then <br/>\nrealized that it was useless- not only could he pin down what he thought a <br/>\n4-5 yr old might need, but he knew that the paper would get buried under <br/>\nsome pile somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been leaving all sorts of lit around the house for years.  I bring up <br/>\ninteresting points I have read and heard.  I have even brought up some of <br/>\nthe things I have seen on this post. He is certainly not opposed to learning <br/>\nabout anyting that may involve the kids!  He just has some ideas that are <br/>\nvery entrenched in his brain... I try not to nag.  The last thing I want is <br/>\nbully him.  I would SO love for him to come to the realization that this has <br/>\nand can work on his own with the minimal amount of nagging. One of his major <br/>\nfears about unschooling is the ability for kids to learn self regulating.  <br/>\nAnother of it is how does a parent &quot;make sure&quot; that their kid is prepared <br/>\nfor all subjects when thet kid may decide to never explore long division <br/>\nwhile living at home, or some other subject that society deems necessary for <br/>\nsomeone to master by the time they are 18.  MY biggest concern is also about <br/>\nself regulating. I worry about being able to let go of my own hang ups so <br/>\nthat the kids can learn it!

Quite a bit of what I have seen has been inspiring and <br/>\nquite eduactional.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughters are 4.5 and 2.  While I was pregnant with the first, dh and I <br/>\ndecided that homeschooling was the way to go.  As the stay at home parent, I <br/>\nhave made most of the decisions and phone calls involving each kid&#39;s <br/>\nactivities.  Not that he was out of the loop, he just wasn&#39;t able to do most <br/>\nof the calls and was tired at night when he got in from work.  I would bring <br/>\nup things I have seen and done, left library books (mine and the girls&#39;) <br/>\naround so that he would be aware of what our interests are and try to make <br/>\nhim feel as involved as he so desperately wanted to be, but couldn&#39;t from <br/>\nhaving to go off to the &quot;mines&quot; every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately (over the past year or so), he has been getting quite a few questions <br/>\nfrom people at his work abour when and where we are going to put the kids <br/>\ninto school.  One day, not too long ago, he told me that when people ask he <br/>\ntells them that &quot;we are thinking seriously about looking into the <br/>\npossibility of homeschooling...&quot;  HUH?  this started a HUGE discussion <br/>\nbetween us.  Turns out that while I tought we were on the same page, he was <br/>\nunder the impression that my unschooling approach was really &quot;just dragging <br/>\nmy feet until the time we need to register the kids with the local <br/>\nauthorities and get our asses in gear.&quot;  He seems to think there was going <br/>\nto be some kind of curriculum involved and we were going to have school at <br/>\nhome!  All of a sudden, I am made aware that he can&#39;t really get behind <br/>\nunschooling because he doesn&#39;t think it will work long term.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know my own limitations (I am a control freak) and I know that at some <br/>\npoint we will probably fall off the unschooling wagon because I just <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t let things be.  I know this and am ok with the thought of coping <br/>\nwith that later.  However, this approach has been unbelievable so far and I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t imagine a better way of exploring the world with my girls right <br/>\nnow.  My question is this- has anyone had a similar issue withh a spouse and <br/>\nwhat ways did you approach it so as to not hurt feelings?  My husband wants <br/>\nto be involved but he has doubts about this philosophy.  Seeing is believing <br/>\nwon&#39;t work because he barely sees th kids while they are awake some days!<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that there is a lot of discussion about how to deal with people who <br/>\njust don&#39;t get it (I have had some experience with that already- 99% of both <br/>\nof our families are very worried for our kids)  Most of the time, I say my <br/>\npiece and then agree to disagree.  I just cannot do this with dh...<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice would be appreciated<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKay<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Wilkinson6@msn.com","from":"Wilkinson6@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"jzPsLn8TryMCihq6nXQ2CzS_uXtog311UC1rU-XBwTq5iDY6XrgRgh453VcSwu-vWZKf6bo9pM-f","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: new to list","postDate":"1001616183","msgId":26346,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlvdnJ2bitza2RoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE1ZC4xYTljMTk5LjI4ZTQ5YzNmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":26321,"nextInTopic":59059,"prevInTime":26345,"nextInTime":26347,"topicId":2578,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Caren Welcome!
