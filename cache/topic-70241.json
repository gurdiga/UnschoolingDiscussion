One thing I d say that I ve noticed in our homeschooling group is that the kids who regularly attend","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1786464979\">From: &quot;Karen McLaughlin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:karenmcl@...\">karenmcl@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We&#39;re working on finding some<br/>\n&gt;homeschooled friends (there aren&#39;t a great many unschoolers around here)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;the local homeschool drop-in which we attend sporadically hasn&#39;t led to any<br/>\n&gt;new friendships yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One thing I&#39;d say that I&#39;ve noticed in our homeschooling group is that the<br/>\nkids who regularly attend lots of events end up knowing each other more,<br/>\nestablishing deeper friendships, and inviting each other over more. I guess<br/>\nit&#39;s a question of familiarity more than anything. New kids are definitely<br/>\nwelcomed into our group, but I can see that it takes time before the kids<br/>\nwho know each other well have figured out who the new kid is, how they like<br/>\nto play, and which of the kids generally ends up being more compatible with<br/>\nthem for individual playdates. That&#39;s hard to do on an occasional basis.<br/>\nMost of Mackenzie&#39;s good friends now he has been playing with for over 2<br/>\nyears at various homeschooling events.<br/>\nSo if you&#39;re looking to find friends for regular get-togethers and<br/>\nplaydates, you might want to try attending consistently and letting him get<br/>\nto know the other kids better. That might spark some new friendships more<br/>\neasily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Noah really values the friends he has now (most of them have played<br/>\n </span></blockquote>together<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;since infancy or toddlerhood) and I&#39;m hoping there will be some way to<br/>\n&gt;maintain these friendships despite school but I sense there may be a lot of<br/>\n&gt;difficulties ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hope you have better luck than we have. Mackenzie says he no longer wants to<br/>\nplay with his two good neighborhood friends. They both went to kindergarten<br/>\nthis year and it really changed everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70236,"nextTopicId":70097}}
