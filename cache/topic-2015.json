Tanya in WA (state)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1271590537\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Let&#39;s say it&#39;s 4:17 p.m. and you&#39;re driving home, or<br/>\n&gt;&gt;cruising....(alone of course) after an unusually hard day <br/>\n&gt;&gt;on the job.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;All of a sudden, you start experiencing severe pain in <br/>\n&gt;&gt;your chest<br/>\n&gt;&gt;that starts to radiate out into your arm and up into your <br/>\n&gt;&gt;jaw.  You<br/>\n&gt;&gt;are only about five miles from the hospital nearest your <br/>\n&gt;&gt;home,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;unfortunately you don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll be able to make it <br/>\n&gt;&gt;that far.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;What can you do?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;You&#39;ve been trained in CPR but the guy that taught the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;course<br/>\n&gt;&gt;neglected to tell you how to perform it on yourself.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart <br/>\n&gt;&gt;attack, this<br/>\n&gt;&gt;article seemed in order.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Without help - the person whose heart stops beating <br/>\n&gt;&gt;properly and who<br/>\n&gt;&gt;begins to feel faint, has only about 10 seconds left <br/>\n&gt;&gt;before<br/>\n&gt;&gt;losing consciousness.   However, these victims can help <br/>\n&gt;&gt;themselves<br/>\n&gt;&gt;by coughing repeatedly and very vigorously.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;the cough<br/>\n&gt;&gt;must be deep and prolonged, as when producing <br/>\n&gt;&gt;sputum from deep<br/>\n&gt;&gt;inside the chest.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;A breath and a cough must be repeated about every <br/>\n&gt;&gt;two seconds<br/>\n&gt;&gt;without let -up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;be beating normally again.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing <br/>\n&gt;&gt;movements<br/>\n&gt;&gt;squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating.  The <br/>\n&gt;&gt;squeezing<br/>\n&gt;&gt;pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; In this<br/>\n&gt;&gt;way, heart attack victims can get to a phone and, <br/>\n&gt;&gt;between breaths, call<br/>\n&gt;&gt;for help.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Tell as many other people as possible about this, it <br/>\n&gt;&gt;could save their<br/>\n&gt;&gt;lives!<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tanya in WA (state)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---SENT FROM A FREE INTERNET AND EMAIL ACCOUNT FROM WWW.FREEi.NET!---</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2014,"nextTopicId":2017}}
