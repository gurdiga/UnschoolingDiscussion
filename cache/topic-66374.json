My daughter is almost 20 months now, and she is starting to talk to me <br/>\nabout &quot;noonies&quot;. she insists I should nurse our kitten. She was fascinated to <br/>\nwatch a friends 3day old foal nurse today. What a fabulous gift to nurse a <br/>\nchild. I have great empathy for the people for whom nursing just does not go <br/>\nthe way they expected it to. <br/>\nNancy in BC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: : Breastfeeding","postDate":"1051569383","msgId":66409,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyOTQwMWMzMGRkNiRiNjM2OWEyMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDk5LjM2ZGVmMjRhLjJiZGVlMjg2QGFvbC5jb20+IDwwMDFiMDFjMzBkYzQkOTBhYjQzODAkNTNjOWZjNDBAMXo1bXEwMT4="},"prevInTopic":66404,"nextInTopic":66503,"prevInTime":66408,"nextInTime":66410,"topicId":66374,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... nursing forever - she s sure it s not only her privilage but her right .
