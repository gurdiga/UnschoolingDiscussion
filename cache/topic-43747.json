And I said no problem because you won&#39;t be late. She just promised me <br/>\nI could trust her, which I said I knew and that&#39;s why I was doing it. Then <br/>\nshe asked if I told my husband yet and I said not yet and she said he would <br/>\nkill me!!! We usually disagree on most matters concerning her.
