I got to compare his efforts to cram<br/>\nlearning into them with our unschooling at home.  Many of the school<br/>\nkids hated school and had a big chip on their shoulders marked &quot;you<br/>\ncan&#39;t make me learn.&quot;  (I don&#39;t blame them a bit!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel so sad that your daughter feels lazy and stupid.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI only have an 8 year old, so I&#39;m not really good at guessing how<br/>\nphilosophical a 10 year old can be.  Can you have useful discussions<br/>\nwith her about how learning works, or is the topic too complex, or too painful?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs mentioned yesterday, I really, really like the beginning of Grace<br/>\nLlewellyn&#39;s Teenage Liberation Handbook.  (And I think it&#39;s suitable for<br/>\nreading aloud to children.)  Maybe you could request it from the library<br/>\nor find a copy to borrow from someone in your homeschooling group if<br/>\nmoney is an issue. (It is for me.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think the part of Frank Smith&#39;s book, The Book of Learning and<br/>\nForgetting, that explains the &quot;forgetting curve&quot; is cool and insightful.<br/>\n This whole book used to be available online, but I don&#39;t currently have<br/>\na link.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to ask, does Megan&#39;s father believe in unschooling?  Does he<br/>\nbelieve in her innate intelligence?  That&#39;s awfully important.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  Meeting other relaxed homeschoolers can be really validating for a<br/>\nchild, especially one who is social or group-oriented in the way she<br/>\nmakes decisions.  A kid who wants to be like other people.

I was <br/>\npublic school and so were my kids, the oldest through sixth grade until we <br/>\n&quot;discovered&quot; homeschooling by medical necessity.  It&#39;s my youngest, a <br/>\ndaughter, who was taken out at the end of 2nd grade, and who is now also <br/>\n10, almost 11, who has had the hardest time adjusting.  She misses the <br/>\ncompany of all the kids, not the work frankly.  We&#39;ve been out of the <br/>\nsystem for over three years now, but I heard the protests for months on <br/>\nend.  At first I had to remind her of all she would miss, like the field <br/>\ntrips, as well as all she would end up with that she would hate like the <br/>\nhomework, spelling, the math, etc.  And I also knew that I just wasn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to give in.  I also came to realize that she needed to have a little <br/>\nmore structure than my oldest kid.  So I began looking around for classes <br/>\nin things she enjoys like art etc, that would give her a feeling of <br/>\naccomplishment and organization and structure and yet wouldn&#39;t overwhelm <br/>\nher (or me!) as far as structure was concerned.  This was/is very much an <br/>\nongoing process of exploration of comfort and discovery of why she <br/>\nwasn&#39;t/isn&#39;t happy with what we were doing at home or what she felt <br/>\n&quot;school&quot; could offer her.  Get her out of the house and look into your city <br/>\npark and rec classes as well as local homeschool coop groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe healing will take years....the guilt is something else...how were you <br/>\nto know?  I didn&#39;t?  And I consider myself an educated, intelligent <br/>\nwoman.  Give it a rest and yourself a break.  Talk to your kid and be up <br/>\nfront.  You don&#39;t have to carry the whole burden...it&#39;s her life too.  Let <br/>\nher share some of your concerns and ask her what she really want&#39;s from <br/>\n&quot;school,&quot; and explain why you don&#39;t want her there.

Me too. From someone who got it somewhere in the middle. We started <br/>\nunschooling at age 9. Damage was already done. I had never heard of <br/>\nhomeschooling until I had online access back in &#39;96 or so. I didn&#39;t think I <br/>\ncould handle being her teacher. Didn&#39;t hear of unschooling until my dd was in <br/>\n3rd grade. This morning I found an old file full of 3rd grade report cards, <br/>\nschool letters, and even notes I made preparing for another conference on how <br/>\nto handle my misbehaving daughter. Double UGH. Is there anyway to undo the <br/>\ndamage? For so long I insisted that she behave and go to school and perform. <br/>\nI can remember in 2nd grade the teacher would send home a daily <br/>\naccountability note, and the tone of the whole evening was set on whether she <br/>\ngot a good note or bad, most times she never measured up. I was so worried <br/>\nabout how I looked as a parent who couldn&#39;t control her child. Ugh all over <br/>\nagain. Now that we have unschooled for over a year, and it all makes sense, I <br/>\nworry about all the years that we forced schooling and learning and behaving. <br/>\nIt breaks my heart to hear other unschoolers on this list say their kids <br/>\nnever lie, they don&#39;t have to. Their kids are not afraid of punishment. My <br/>\ndaughter has been lying to me for years. I try so hard to just forgive <br/>\nmyself, I truly didn&#39;t know any better. But as the end of the school year <br/>\napproaches, and she wants to go back next year to middle school, I can&#39;t help <br/>\nbut think it is a result of being in the system so long. She thinks she needs <br/>\nschooling. She doesn&#39;t feel right &quot;doing nothing&quot; around here, and when she <br/>\ndoes get into certain topics, she hardly finishes anything and calls herself <br/>\nlazy and stupid.
