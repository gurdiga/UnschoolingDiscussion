Has anyone any experience of coming to this sort of lifestyle when the kids are already older (17, 13, 10) and have already developed","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-332111466\">Thanks Samantha<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Read Nicki and David Colfaxes book about their<br/>\n&gt; homesteading experience. They couldn&#39;t have done it if<br/>\n&gt; the kids didn&#39;t help in some way.  So depending on how<br/>\n&gt; old your kids are (mine are still quite young) find<br/>\n&gt; out what they would like to do to help.  Some things<br/>\n&gt; that come to mind for me is:  read about<br/>\n&gt; permaculture/natural gardening as a family, ask the<br/>\n&gt; kids for help, make a list of the things to do in a<br/>\n&gt; garden then everyone helps do what they would most<br/>\n&gt; enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Has anyone any experience of coming to this sort of lifestyle when the kids<br/>\nare already older (17, 13, 10) and have already developed interests in<br/>\nindoor, city things? The 13yo is kind of interested, the 17yo helps with<br/>\nbuilding the house, the 10 isn&#39;t interested at all - and is the most needy.<br/>\nIs it too late to inspire them? I guess that&#39;s a silly question, as I have<br/>\ncome to it older than they are. But it&#39;s frustrating &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Look for permaculture groups  in your area or start<br/>\n&gt; one and let them come over to your place and get lots<br/>\n&gt; of hands on experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We are gradually getting a small support network going with a handful of<br/>\npeople, mostly just starting out like us. There is another group of<br/>\npermaculturists around here, but they all got into it at the same time, did<br/>\na PDC together, and although they are friendly enough on a casual basis,<br/>\nthey have their support network up and running among themselves and don&#39;t<br/>\nseem particularly interested in expanding to include new  comers :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as I say, we do have a small group going - and better still, all<br/>\nhomeschoolers as well! Thought the others are younger than me and have much<br/>\nyounger children - their oldest children are the same age as my youngest.<br/>\nStill, that support is good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I was just feeling extra frustrated yesterday, as there was only a<br/>\nvery small &#39;window of opportunity between rainfalls, which is due to<br/>\ncontinue for several more days.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut most of the time I am blissfully happy on our land. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14766,"nextTopicId":14771}}
