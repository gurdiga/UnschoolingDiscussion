Sometimes, <br/>\nlater,   one of them discovered something I&#39;d bought years earlier and <br/>\nloved  it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n================<br/>\n <br/>\nSame here.  There are COOL things no one ever cared about, but there  are <br/>\nalso things that cost little to nothing that have been played with and shown  off <br/>\nover and over.<br/>\n <br/>\nI bought a little wood-carving of an owl the other day, from Japan.   $1.98 <br/>\nat Goodwill.  Mostly I thought my husband would like to see it.   It was all <br/>\ncut from one stick of wood, and there were curly wing feathers and  tail <br/>\nfeathers.  I put it on the island counter in the kitchen, and  everyone, family <br/>\nmember and guest, has picked it up and looked.  Holly  reminded me we had another <br/>\ncarved owl she found in a woodpile in a friend&#39;s  house when she was little, so <br/>\nwe put them together.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThere have been $15 books that got barely a glance.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut it&#39;s been that way with my husband too, and adult friends. Sometimes we  <br/>\npick a restaurant or recommend a movie or give a gift that kinda falls  flat.  <br/>\nOther times the slightest whiff of a hint turns into some  life-changing <br/>\ninterest-fest.<br/>\n <br/>\nBacking off of offering doesn&#39;t do it.  Offer more.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104222,"nextTopicId":24121}}
