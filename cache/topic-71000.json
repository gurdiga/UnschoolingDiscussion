Dh <br/>\ndrinks about a 6 pack of beer in 2 weeks. .   Sometimes one of the wine coolers is <br/>\ngone or one is opened and half empty.  My response is, &quot;HEY, who drank my <br/>\nwine cooler??  *pout.    I always get someone giggling or snickering and <br/>\nsheepishly admitting &quot;it was me&quot;.    My reply,  &quot;Darn!, I was really looking forward <br/>\nto that wine cooler.!&quot;   They never get into their Dad&#39;s beer.  They have all <br/>\ntasted it and YUCK!, they are not interested in drinking any.   But those wine <br/>\ncoolers look too inviting, too much like fruit juice or kool-aid.  Landon is <br/>\nthe only one who likes any of the flavors  well enough to drink a whole one.  <br/>\nThe other kids are the culprits in opening them just to get a taste.<br/>\n<br/>\n   It&#39;s pretty much the same way with any particular grocery item that <br/>\nsomeone picks out themselves.  Anna&#39;s favorite ice cream.  Landon&#39;s favorite cookie. <br/>\n A special treat that JP picks out.  Ethans beloved french fries.  They do <br/>\nnot belong to that one person in particular, they are for the whole family to <br/>\nshare.  But when they are all gone..
