She struggles with reading, spelling, and math.  She didn t learn to read until age","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1440181667\">Although my daughter has never been tested and labeled I&#39;d say she has LD.  <br/>\nShe struggles with reading, spelling, and math.  She didn&#39;t learn to read <br/>\nuntil age 12.  I just tried to read with her every day and then maybe she <br/>\nwould want to read with me.  We used the Bob Books and Dr. Suess and other <br/>\neasy readers from the library for her reading.  Then finally something <br/>\nclicked and she was reading.  She still turns letters around and reads words <br/>\nwrong but she can usually get the meaning of something.  We also played some <br/>\nof the games from &quot;Games for Reading&quot; for Peggy Kaye.  One favorite for all <br/>\nof my kids has been letting them copy words onto index cards from some of <br/>\ntheir favorite books.  Then they rearrange the cards on the floor to make up <br/>\ntheir own sentences.  They love making up nonsense sentences.  When they <br/>\nmoved on from early readers all of my kids have loved the &quot;Magic Treehouse <br/>\nBooks&quot;.<br/>\nMath is still a huge struggle.  Even though she is of 9th grade age she is <br/>\ndoing 6th grade level math.  That&#39;s when she does math.  She has a hard time <br/>\nremembering something from one day to the next.  It took her over two years <br/>\nto get the concepts of fractions and sometimes I still have to explain how <br/>\nto convert fractions to whole numbers.  I have really backed off this year <br/>\nto a true unschooling approach.  I was so worried about her future and how <br/>\nwould she ever get into college if she couldn&#39;t do all these things.  Then I <br/>\nremembered that the reason I started homeschooling 15 years ago was so that <br/>\nmy children could learn what they wanted at their own pace.  I trusted my <br/>\nolder children to learn and they did in their own time.  I have 6 kids and <br/>\nthree of them have to work very hard to learn something that comes easy to <br/>\nmost people.  My oldest daughter is in her second year of college and doing <br/>\nvery well.  She studies very hard to make good grades but it is something <br/>\nshe is doing because she wants it.<br/>\nI&#39;ve spent way too much money on programs and gimmicks that were supposed to <br/>\nhelp my LD child learn some concept.  I don&#39;t think any of them worked.  <br/>\nFrom my own experience I&#39;d say that if a child needs or wants to know <br/>\nsomething they will figure out a way to learn it.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard <br/>\nthat before but it&#39;s always good to hear it again.  Also, it just takes <br/>\ntime.  With your love and patience your son will learn the skills that he <br/>\nneeds for now and the future.<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"mywheel","from":"&quot;mywheel&quot; &lt;mywheel@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"5TTHzHQuh1_inekgecUMOR-QX6zZE8KEajmBMcMc8W9ebRCeWsxOfNCN6UvoYWt8ust1WGuHlYQV543z6ifRyNfltw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] LD info","postDate":"985351574","msgId":17191,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDMwMWMwYjM5NyQ0MWQ5Y2JjMCQzOTIyYTAzZkBlcmllLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDNBQkFDQzJBLjJEMjYzNzQzQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":17190,"nextInTopic":17195,"prevInTime":17190,"nextInTime":17192,"topicId":17181,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just wanted to add to my last post, remember, I just started unschooling about a month ago.  :-) Anybody unschooling in PA??

Try not to rely on the drill and kill methods especially if they are in the form of ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-353248789\">Dear Linda,<br/>\n    In my opinion, math is the easiest subject to unschool.  Try not to<br/>\nrely on the drill and kill methods especially if they are in the form of<br/>\nworksheets (or Saxon math lessons).  Any child, LD or not, learn more<br/>\nand retain more when math is presented in the context of real living.<br/>\nThere is so much you can do to make math fun and meaningful.<br/>\n    If he likes to cook, encourage him to help you half, double, triple,<br/>\netc. recipes for dinner or dessert.  Let him help you figure out the<br/>\ndifferent measurements needed.  Let him do the measuring.  Let him<br/>\ncreate the grocery list, cut the coupons, and help you compare prices in<br/>\nthe grocery.  Have him estimate as you shop the amount of money being<br/>\nspent.  By all means, let him play with his food.  Make 3D shapes with<br/>\nmarshmallows and toothpicks.  Turn a pizza dinner into a fraction<br/>\n&quot;lesson.&quot;  Let him help you balance your checkbook and keep track of<br/>\nsavings account balances.  Does he like to garden?  Wow!  Tons of math<br/>\napplication in planning and caring for a garden.  Does he have a<br/>\nparticular hobby or talent he can turn into a business?  Letting him<br/>\ncreate his business plan, borrow money from you to get started, keeping<br/>\ntrack of sales and inventory, advertising.  I could go on and on.  It<br/>\ncould be as simple as walking the neighborhood dogs to selling<br/>\nvegetables grown in his garden.  Do you have any adult friends who use<br/>\nmath daily in their career?  Set up an apprenticeship or at least some<br/>\nregular time for your son to work along side someone who uses math in a<br/>\nmeaningful way in his/her job.  Does he like to construct?  Legos are a<br/>\ngreat math &quot;activity.&quot;  There is even a website devoted just to &quot;Lego<br/>\ngurus.&quot;  Is he an artist?  Tons of math in art and art projects.<br/>\n    Make everything a game.  If he doesn&#39;t know his addition or<br/>\nmultiplication facts, first decide if he really has to  memorize them.<br/>\nIf you feel he does, practice them through card and dice games.  Marilyn<br/>\nBurns has some great math literature books geared to kids such as Math<br/>\nfor Smarty Pants or I Hate Mathematics.  A small company called Box Cars<br/>\nand One Eyed Jacks  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.planet.eon.net/~boxcars/home.htm\">http://www.planet.eon.net/~boxcars/home.htm</a>  has<br/>\nsome really great (and cheap) game books to help reinforce computational<br/>\nskills.  And there are tons of board games our there that teach and<br/>\nreinforce computational skills, problem solving and logical thinking.<br/>\nCheck out Turn the TV Off company<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.turnoffthetv.com/profiles/index.htm\">http://www.turnoffthetv.com/profiles/index.htm</a> and Mindware for great<br/>\nmath and strategy games.<br/>\n    And don&#39;t be afraid to let him use the calculator.  In the age of<br/>\nthe printing press, many scholars thought books would hinder imagination<br/>\nand in the 1800&#39;s, teachers thought the use of pencils would make<br/>\nstudents lazy.  Some &quot;experts&quot; have the same opinion of calculators but<br/>\nlet&#39;s be honest.  How many adults do not use a calculator to perform<br/>\ntedious or time consuming computations.  LD kids, in particular, gain<br/>\nmore confidence in mathematics and take more risks in problem solving<br/>\nwhen given an opportunity to use a calculator.<br/>\n    I think I am finished now.
