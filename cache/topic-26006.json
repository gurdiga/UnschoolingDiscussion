None. My husband would, but let&#39;s say he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t: the guys at the paint store do. My nephew does. I don&#39;t need to know<br/>\neverything.

How is it a kid decides on his own to study<br/>\n&gt; this particular poem out of millions published in the English language? With<br/>\n&gt; the help of an educated adult, usually a teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Culture is what the culture makes, not a few so-called classics hand-picked<br/>\nby a few so-called experts. You want culturally literate? Know who Dexter<br/>\nand his Lab are when you&#39;re talking to my 6 year old. You don&#39;t know a<br/>\nmuggle from a wizard? You won&#39;t last a day in a group of most 12 year olds.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr let&#39;s take my generation. &quot;Your mission, should you decide to accept&quot;<br/>\nwill get a laugh in a room of most adults over 30 or so. That&#39;s cultural<br/>\nliteracy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne particular 17th century poem is not more important across the board to<br/>\nevery human than any other poem, song, lyric, or ditty. The ideas put forth<br/>\nin one particular poem are not completely unique to human knowledge: the<br/>\nlesson in the bell tolling can be found from any number of other sources:<br/>\nfact, fiction, experience, conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody knows everything. Nobody can know everything. Reading 17th century<br/>\npoetry is not inherently more or less important than learning to bake a<br/>\ndecent cake, drive a nail, memorize a table of molds and mildews, sing every<br/>\nsong in the musical The Chorus Line, train a dog, drive a car, play the<br/>\nbanjo, speak German, know vast quantities of Disney trivia.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne size does not fit all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ultimately, all learning is self-driven, whether you&#39;re in a classroom or<br/>\n&gt; not. The school systems have the task of turning out people proficient enough<br/>\n&gt; in English and mathematics to effectively solve daily problems in the<br/>\n&gt; business world and home life. Additionally, children need to be culturally<br/>\n&gt; educated enough to understand our world, some of its history and intellectual<br/>\n&gt; heritage, and the basics of the main scientific principles underpinning<br/>\n&gt; modern life. The functioning of society relies on us having some amount of<br/>\n&gt; common, general knowledge. (I like the thought of the Core Knowledge<br/>\n&gt; curriculum group.) Unfortunately, the government sees the results of<br/>\n&gt; standardized testing as the significant measure of success.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In short (ha!), I agree there are plenty of people  who do well in life<br/>\n&gt; without formal training. However, I have a great deal of respect for those<br/>\n&gt; who pursue higher education. My answer to Mr. Shaw is that he achieved<br/>\n&gt; literary success BECAUSE he received sufficient training in the drudgery of<br/>\n&gt; English grammar and spelling so that he was then able to use these tools, in<br/>\n&gt; concert with his innate talent, to generate his works.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And Mark Twain said, &quot;I never let my schooling interfere with my education.&quot;<br/>\nSo Mr. Shaw may have been right for him, but that doesn&#39;t mean he was right<br/>\nfor every person. And unschooling would allow Mr. Shaw or Mr. Twain to<br/>\npursue their own path.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"a74PHpCcye6VuS_6K4sFaiF0bM13XSTGfMYuoyy4wGMlZCliX6E9Dg6ky0JWXEOi3hIp1h7z7U93","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] From a client","postDate":"1000914313","msgId":26033,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExNS40ZDg2YmE1LjI4ZGExNzg5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":26006,"nextInTopic":26037,"prevInTime":26032,"nextInTime":26034,"topicId":26006,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/19/01 6:44:48 AM, NumoAstro@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-798831956\">In a message dated 9/19/01 6:44:48 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NumoAstro@...\">NumoAstro@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; We KNOW &quot;for whom the bell tolls.&quot; Is there a huge value to <br/>\nmemorizing this 17th century poem?

My vote is yes. Should <br/>\nkids reading it for the first time today discuss it in the context of the <br/>\nevents of last week? Certainly!!! How is it a kid decides on his own to study <br/>\nthis particular poem out of millions published in the English language? With <br/>\nthe help of an educated adult, usually a teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, all learning is self-driven, whether you&#39;re in a classroom or <br/>\nnot. The school systems have the task of turning out people proficient enough <br/>\nin English and mathematics to effectively solve daily problems in the <br/>\nbusiness world and home life. Additionally, children need to be culturally <br/>\neducated enough to understand our world, some of its history and intellectual <br/>\nheritage, and the basics of the main scientific principles underpinning <br/>\nmodern life. The functioning of society relies on us having some amount of <br/>\ncommon, general knowledge. (I like the thought of the Core Knowledge <br/>\ncurriculum group.) Unfortunately, the government sees the results of <br/>\nstandardized testing as the significant measure of success. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn short (ha!), I agree there are plenty of people  who do well in life <br/>\nwithout formal training. However, I have a great deal of respect for those <br/>\nwho pursue higher education. My answer to Mr. Shaw is that he achieved <br/>\nliterary success BECAUSE he received sufficient training in the drudgery of <br/>\nEnglish grammar and spelling so that he was then able to use these tools, in <br/>\nconcert with his innate talent, to generate his works.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nDawn Falbe  <br/>\nPersonal Development Coach<br/>\nRelocational Astrologer<br/>\n(520) 579-2646<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nThe Path of Least Resistance is Inside of You<br/>\nwww.astrologerdawn.com<br/>\nEnlightening women on how to live their Soul Purpose<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The people who get on in this world<br/>\n are people who get up and look for the<br/>\n circumstances they want, and, <br/>\nif they can&#39;t find them, make them.&quot; - George Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school.&quot;-George <br/>\nBernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26072,"nextTopicId":26086}}
