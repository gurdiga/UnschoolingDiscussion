My name is Virginia and I live in SC and I am trying to get my son Christopher (about to eight and in the second grade) out of the public school system.

I know. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo years ago, when my son was in kindergarden, I tried to homeschool. The school got DSS involved because they thought my son had ADHD. His TEAHER had &quot;diagnosed&quot; him. Out of fear, I backed down. My ex and I had just separated and I was scared they would take Chris away from me. So I kept him in school and let them put him on Concerta. His problems have worsened instead of improving.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough Chris manages to pass all his subjects, he is supposedly disruptive to the other students. I look forward to having him at home. I have been &quot;homeschooling&quot; him since he was born. Chris could write and read when he entered kindergarden. He knew his colors, shapes, numbers and such in pre-kindergarden. Children just have to learn the way they learn and the school system is not set up for that. They are set up as a diploma factory.
