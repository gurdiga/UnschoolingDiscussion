Of course, as <br/>\nan unschooler, I still have to disagree with him. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are millions of people who are struggling to make a living <br/>\nbecause school disabled them so badly. Not only did it fail to give <br/>\nthem adequate information for surviving in the real world, but it <br/>\nfostered a deep aversion to learning and trampled their self esteem. <br/>\nThen there are the millions of people who somehow managed to get <br/>\nthrough school to the point where they *are* making a good living, <br/>\nbut they are depressed because they are assemblyline products of a <br/>\nfactory system. A life that is forced to be focused on jumping <br/>\nthrough a series of hoops (that do not themselves offer anything of <br/>\nvalue) simply so that one will be allowed to move on farther down <br/>\nthe assembly line and finally make enough money to impress the <br/>\nneighbors, is not necessarily a life that guarantees happiness. In <br/>\nfact, it is almost certain to *not* confer happiness. The American <br/>\nDream is for most people a big fat lie. Superficially, they might <br/>\nachieve it, but inside they are in bad shape. The incredible number <br/>\nof people with pyschological disorders and depression in this <br/>\ncountry (regardless of income level) must attest to that, don&#39;t you <br/>\nthink?<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to tell you about my friend Jacques. When he was a kid, his <br/>\nmother and father bought a piece of woodland property. His mother <br/>\nstill lives there, and Jacques has now built his own house there. He <br/>\nbuilt it himself over a period of years; every time he had a little <br/>\nextra money, he did a little more. The house is unbelievably cozy <br/>\nand pleasant to be in. Jacques is not rich. He doesn&#39;t even work <br/>\nregularly, only doing carpentry odd jobs here and there. His need <br/>\nfor income is not high, though, as he lives simply. Every time I see <br/>\nthis man he has a smile on his face. He is calm and serene, and <br/>\ncarries an air of general satisfaction about him. People are drawn <br/>\nto him because he gives off the glow of a life well lived. Every <br/>\nnight he and his girlfriend fix a fire in their wood stove and make <br/>\na simple, healthy meal. They read, or play musical instruments (they <br/>\nboth are quite good, but then, they have had enough time, given <br/>\ntheir lifestyle, to play enough to become good.) It is very easy to <br/>\nsee children come into this scenario. They are not poor. They are <br/>\nnot suffering. Children do not need much aside from good nutrition, <br/>\nlove (which, because of their chosen lifestyle, their parents would <br/>\nhave a lot of time to give,) and opportunities to explore and enrich <br/>\ntheir lives, which I can see being provided by the nearby town <br/>\nlibrary, theatre, art center, etc, and the many friends their <br/>\nparents have. The point being that there are ways to create a life <br/>\nthat will support a family and a sense of well-being, which are not <br/>\ndependant on having a nine-to-five job, a career, a degree, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nI do have expectations of my own children, in a sense, though I <br/>\nthink the more accurate word is &quot;hopes&quot;, since &quot;expectation&quot; implies <br/>\nthat they owe me something. I hope they will live their lives with <br/>\nintegrity and self-confidence, and that they will do things because <br/>\nthey are valuable to them, not just because someone else has told <br/>\nthem they &quot;should&quot;. I assume this will make them happy, which is <br/>\nalso what I hope for them. To be happy. And I don&#39;t know anyone who <br/>\nis happy being policed. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou touched on this already, with your example of your cello <br/>\nplaying. When I was in fifth grade I reached a point in my piano <br/>\ninstruction where I just didn&#39;t enjoy pushing myself to learn harder <br/>\npieces. I hated practicing. When my piano teacher (who was probably <br/>\nuncomfortable about taking my parents&#39; money when I wasn&#39;t <br/>\nprogressing) had a talk with my mom about it, I felt very bad. Like <br/>\nI was letting her down, like I was wasting her money. And in fact, I <br/>\ncould see that my mom was embarrassed by the teacher&#39;s <br/>\nconfrontation. But all she said to me after that was, &quot;it&#39;s your <br/>\nchoice whether you want to practice or not. It&#39;s doesn&#39;t matter to <br/>\nme, I just want you to be happy.&quot; I spent the entire next year <br/>\nhappily *not* practicing. In a sense, I &quot;quit&quot;, as far as training <br/>\nand progress goes. And then guess what happened? My desire to be <br/>\nbetter came back. But then another year would go by and I would lose <br/>\ninterest in practicing again. This has been my pattern ever since. I <br/>\nam now a quite accomplished musician, and I believe that I got this <br/>\nfar because I was allowed to do it on my own terms. I often wonder <br/>\nwhat would have happened if I&#39;d been forced to practice, &quot;for my own <br/>\ngood&quot;? I&#39;m grateful now that my mom had enough sense to not force it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut will our kids blame us when they aren&#39;t good at something they <br/>\nwould like to be good at? Frankly, I hope my kids aren&#39;t that self-<br/>\nabsorbed and lacking in common sense. A friend of mine blames his <br/>\nparents for him not being a better athlete because when he quit the <br/>\nbaseball team in gradeschool they didn&#39;t force him to continue! It&#39;s <br/>\nalso his parents&#39; fault that he&#39;s not a great musician because they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t force him to practice piano. And a myriad of other things. I <br/>\nfind that attitude shocking. To me that&#39;s the epitome of laziness, <br/>\nto expect *others* to be responsible for making something impressive <br/>\nout of you. But it also just doesn&#39;t make logical sense. Because <br/>\nwhen someone forces you to do something it takes the joy out of it. <br/>\nThink about it. Say there is something that right now you have <br/>\nabsolutely no interest in, and the only way you will have anything <br/>\nto do with it is if somebody forces you to, and you know if they do <br/>\nthat you will begin to dislike learning and maybe even the thing <br/>\nitself -- but there is also a slight possibility that in the future <br/>\nyou will think, &quot;gee, I would be so happy if I was proficient in <br/>\nthis thing!&quot; Would it be okay with you if someone had the power <br/>\nright now to force you to learn that thing? And if they don&#39;t wield <br/>\nthat power over you, will you hold them responsible in the future <br/>\nbecause you don&#39;t know how to do this thing? Would you, in other <br/>\nwords, trade loss of freedom and joy for some arbitrary skill? Why <br/>\nnot instead focus on gaining skill in something that does *not* <br/>\nrequire depriving you of freedom and joy? Wouldn&#39;t that be so much <br/>\nbetter?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour husband argues that children do not have the benefit of <br/>\nexperience to tell them what they need to do to prepare for <br/>\nfulfilling lives, and that therefore parents, who do have <br/>\nexperience, should prepare them. I agree, but realistically you can <br/>\nonly take that so far. You can advise your children, provide <br/>\nmaterials, open up the path to opportunities. But you can&#39;t predict <br/>\nwhat academic skills will be valuable to your child, if any. I <br/>\nlearned so much math that I could have entered an engineering <br/>\nprogram. Guess what, I&#39;m not interested in engineering. But I am <br/>\ninterested in self-sufficiency, in farming and canning and raising <br/>\nlivestock and carpentry and sewing. Oh woe is me, that my parents <br/>\ndidn&#39;t teach me any of that. Oh poor, poor me, now I&#39;ll have to <br/>\nlearn it from scratch as an adult. How could my parents have done <br/>\nthis to me? And damn, I wasted all that time on math! (And I mean <br/>\nthat last bit seriously.) I know a man, by the way, who was <br/>\nunschooled and knew nothing but basic arithmetic, who took a basic <br/>\nmath class in college, found out that he liked it and was good at <br/>\nit, and went on to get a degree in mathematics. True story. And he <br/>\nis unschooling his kids now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really a matter of attitude. Are you going to take <br/>\nresponsibility for your own life or not? Are you going to live in <br/>\nthe past, or make things happen now? And which approach to life do <br/>\nyou hope for your children to learn from you?<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with your husband, though, that parents do have a <br/>\nresponsbility to their children. They have a responsibility to <br/>\nsupport them in becoming strong, self-confident and self-determined <br/>\npeople. They have a responsibility to encourage their curiosity and <br/>\nlove of learning rather than squelching it. They have a <br/>\nresponsibility to give them a safe, secure base from which to <br/>\nexplore the world and determine their rightful place in it. They <br/>\nhave a responsibility to show by example that the really valuable <br/>\nthings in life also feel good, and that anything else is death to <br/>\nthe human spirit.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128695025,"authorName":"Wife2Vegman","from":"Wife2Vegman &lt;wifetovegman2002@...&gt;","profile":"wifetovegman2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Hey, Lyle!

He LOVED kindegarten (I did <br/>\nnot want him to go, I had been reading Nancy Wallace, GWS, John Holt, <br/>\na book called Deschooling our Lives, starting around the time Andrew <br/>\nwas 3. Anyway, he hated 1st grade and I just told my husband that he <br/>\ngot to have Andrew in school for Kindergarten and now it was my turn <br/>\nto have him home.<br/>\n<br/>\n We used Calvert for 3 months until I thought we would blow our heads <br/>\noff! Then we pretty much unschooled from then til 6th grade, with <br/>\noccaisional what I like to call &quot;unschoolers academic panic attacks&quot; <br/>\nwhich lasted maybe a week and then we off doing our own thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen when Andrew was in 6th grade my husband was not happy about <br/>\nunschooling and wanted a curriculum. So we did Oak Meadow and have <br/>\nbeen doing that since this past December &#39;03. We did it in a very <br/>\nrelaxed way. I didn&#39;t check it, let Andrew decide what he was going <br/>\nto do and when.  But my dh still checked up on him and put a little <br/>\npressure on him here and there. It pissed me off, and I am not the <br/>\nsilent type.:-)  Andrew is an amazingly compliant kid. I wish he <br/>\nwould fight more for what he wanted or be a pain in the butt so my dh <br/>\nwe see there was no other way but to unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, Andrew is unschooling totally, however, he is thinking he wants <br/>\nto try high school and I talked with him and told him that there are <br/>\nonly 2 things he&#39;d really have to know how to do, which he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nnow, and that would be to write an essay and to have decent grasp of <br/>\npre-algebra (as I have found out about what the school requires..we <br/>\nlive in the northern suburbs of Atlanta, GA approx 35 minutes from <br/>\nthe city). So he told me he would like me to help him to be able to <br/>\ndo that stuff. (Personally, I am desperately hoping he changes his <br/>\nmind...ugh!...I hate school and I was good at it, but I just can&#39;t <br/>\nstand it)<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, Ben is 7.  He has mild autistic spectrum disorder. I was the <br/>\none who wrote the desperate email &quot;Please somebody H-E-L-P&quot; <br/>\nrecently.  I got so many tremendous responses that really helped me <br/>\nget to my center. Things I know are true. Like how great Ben is and <br/>\nnot to look at the problems he has (and they are legit) but to look <br/>\nat what wonderful things there are about him and what a loving kid he <br/>\nis. He is better off at home. Ben had 5 weeks of special ed public <br/>\nschool. It was a bloody nightmare! Since that time he has had a <br/>\ntotally school-phobic reaction to even the word school. SO how could <br/>\nI put him back there? Prior to school he had been unschooled. Since <br/>\nthen he has been unschooled.  We have helped him learn to count to 15 <br/>\n(which took almost 2 years) and learn most of the alphabet things he <br/>\nwanted but which do not come easy for him. Not in a schooly way, just <br/>\nin the context of life way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAutumn, God Bless her, has always been unschooled. She will be 4 in <br/>\nFeb. She asks to go to school sometimes and I took her to a nursery <br/>\nschool to see what it was like and she wanted to stay. :-) She is <br/>\nsuper social and just wants to play with all the kids. She has a good <br/>\nfriend, Daniel, who is 5 and goes to prek (PreK is free in GA as it <br/>\nis paid for by the lottery). He has fun and talks about it.  She <br/>\nwants to go.  She could go in the fall but I don&#39;t know. I would miss <br/>\nher too much. If you opt for the free PreK the kids have to be there <br/>\nall day like Kindergarten.  Isn&#39;t that insane?

Clearly, I had other things on my mind. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is being a great cellist good for, though?  If you had loved cello and <br/>\nit had come easily and you woke up thinking &quot;cello&quot; you&#39;d probably still be <br/>\ndoing it.   And do you play now?  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Don&#39;t parents&#39; experiences count for something when raising their kids. <br/>\nHow can someone who is 4 or 7 even understand that their education belongs to <br/>\nthem, aren&#39;t we supposed to be here to help them? Is raising kids just about <br/>\ngiving them food, shelter and love, the rest is just up to them. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems foreign to me personally.  I have never once agreed with people <br/>\nwho said &quot;their education belongs to them.&quot;  I don&#39;t even like the word <br/>\n&quot;education,&quot; because it, like teaching, is something imposed from the outside.   I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think a person&#39;s learning belongs to him either, in the sense that they <br/>\nshould figure out on their own what they want.   I don&#39;t like it when parents say <br/>\n&quot;When he tells me what he wants to learn, I help him learn it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of those things came from me.  I&#39;ve seen them too, but I don&#39;t like them <br/>\nmuch.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids&#39; learning comes from where my learning comes from.  Something is <br/>\nhappening and anyone there throws out whatever comments or knowledge or jokes or <br/>\nquestions he has, and together we examine or admire or analyze or play with or <br/>\nsomehow note, and then each of us processes some of that information, probably <br/>\nforgets some of it, ties it in with whatever each of us knows or cares about <br/>\n(all that&#39;s internal brain-stuff, memory and thought), and the next time <br/>\nthere&#39;s something to connect to it, we all connect some more thoughts, maybe just <br/>\ninternally, maybe with a reference back to the other thing, maybe by physically <br/>\nholding those two things together, or saying &quot;Just like that other one,&quot; or <br/>\nwhatever it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve rented A Knight&#39;s Tale.   That will be a Chaucer tie-in for life, for <br/>\nme who&#39;s read a fair amount of Chaucer, and for my kids who&#39;ve read none, but <br/>\nI&#39;ve read parts of The Miller&#39;s Tale to them (the &quot;Alysoun anon let flee a <br/>\nfart&quot; passage) and told them some more.  It doesn&#39;t matter to me whether they <br/>\npursue Chaucer or not.  They now have a hook to hang it on.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are similarities between A Knight&#39;s Tale and The Mighty Ducks, most <br/>\nobvious being &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; by Queen, but there are others.   Holly and I <br/>\njust watched Labyrinth; A Knight&#39;s Tale has a David Bowie song too.   I have a <br/>\nletter from David Bowie, from 1967.

For one thing it makes it seem like<br/>\nunschoolers don&#39;t care where kids end up. But what it is is trust in the<br/>\nprocess that interests are the best foundation for life&#39;s pursuits. being<br/>\nable to pursue what we enjoy is what makes us jump out of bed in the<br/>\nmorning. It&#39;s what makes us willing to put up with things we don&#39;t like<br/>\nbecause we know we&#39;ll get to do something we really, really like.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd trust in the kids themselves that they are whole people who want to *do*<br/>\nthings in life, not just have life happen to them. (Even -- maybe espcially<br/>\n-- when what they may be doing looks like that&#39;s all they care about! That&#39;s<br/>\nwhen we need to look further and find out what&#39;s really going on rather than<br/>\nwhat it looks like on the surface that&#39;s going on.) And trust in biology<br/>\nthat we&#39;re wired to leave home and go out on our own. Biology is what drives<br/>\nmale lions away from the pride they were born in even though it would be<br/>\neasier for them to stay.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s helpful to think about why schooling works and why it doesn&#39;t work.<br/>\nSchool *does* turn out decent kids who go on to get jobs and not be burdens<br/>\non society. People may want it to do more or something else, but that&#39;s<br/>\nbascially what it was designed for.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut sometimes school fails. Sometimes it works okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf coerced learning works sometimes and fails others, then it isn&#39;t the<br/>\ncoerced learning that&#39;s working. There are other factors that allow coerced<br/>\nlearning to work. And, unfortunately, those factors aren&#39;t controllable. It<br/>\nhas to do with personality, home environment, school environment, learning<br/>\nstyle and so on and so on. If someone has the right combination of factors<br/>\n-- they have a learning style that matches school, they have interests that<br/>\nmatch what&#39;s being taught, they have a personality that can conform to being<br/>\ntold what to learn and how to go about learning it -- then coerced learning<br/>\nwill &quot;work&quot; (that is have the results school is designed to have.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beauty of unschooling is that it is independent of many of the factors<br/>\ncoerced learning depends on. Unschooling adapts to the child and his needs,<br/>\nrather than the child having to adapt to the needs of school and the needs<br/>\nof the agenda the adults have for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing unschoolind depends on is how well a parent can respect a<br/>\nchild&#39;s interests (not just the interests that look like they&#39;re leading the<br/>\nfuture or look like something they&#39;d do in school) and strew and nurture and<br/>\nsupport and model. (And that&#39;s part of what the list is for :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s lots more to say on that, but it&#39;s a beginning anyway!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That if our kids made a commitment to some kind of activity and wanted to<br/>\n&gt; stop, not because they didn&#39;t like it anymore, but because it was becoming<br/>\n&gt; harder or more challenging, that it might be a good thing to expect them to<br/>\n&gt; really give it some thought before totally giving up (not that that would stop<br/>\n&gt; them from giving up anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The subject of what to do about &quot;commitments&quot; has come up *lots*!

From what you write here I don&#39;t hear your DH <br/>\nsaying &quot;no way, not with my kids&quot;. He sounds like he is open to the idea but <br/>\nneeds more information and maybe just time. My DH and I had some of the same <br/>\nproblems you are experiencing but we kept on talking and learning and living and <br/>\nthe kids kept coming along and interacting with him so that eventually he was <br/>\nable to see it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also like to add that I have seen schools create totally <br/>\ndisinterested kids, I don&#39;t know if I would call them lazy, the schools probably would as <br/>\nmight their parents but I saw kids who had just shut down, tuned out so to <br/>\nspeak. There are no guarantees in life.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt; That if our kids made a commitment to some kind of activity and wanted to <br/>\nstop, not because they didn&#39;t like it anymore, but because it was becoming <br/>\nharder or more challenging, that it might be a good thing to expect them to really <br/>\ngive it some thought before totally giving up (not that that would stop them <br/>\nfrom giving up anyway).&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids start and stop things but I do not so much think it is because it <br/>\nbecame too hard. What I do find is that as we travel farther along this path my <br/>\nkids and myself have become so much more in tune with ourselves that we know <br/>\nvery fast if something we try is a fit or not. I don&#39;t make my kids continue <br/>\nwith something they are sure they don&#39;t want to do. They have made a decision <br/>\nthough to stick with something like a sports team who they knew counted on them <br/>\nto be there, but they made the choice I did not force it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;I remember thinking back in my 20s  how I wished my parents had pushed me to <br/>\nstay with the Cello.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI just have never had success making anyone do anything, even before we found <br/>\nthis lifestyle. All of my kids have been incredibly independent, they have <br/>\nbeen my best teachers.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt; My husband said, &quot;How do they know now, what we have only figured out <br/>\nrecently, the kinds of thing one needs to know so that having the life you want is <br/>\neasier to live? Don&#39;t parents&#39; experiences count for something when raising <br/>\ntheir kids. How can someone who is 4 or 7 even understand that their education <br/>\nbelongs to them, aren&#39;t we supposed to be here to help them? Is raising kids <br/>\njust about giving them food, shelter and love, the rest is just up to them.  <br/>\nWouldn&#39;t that feel scary to a kid that it is up to them?&quot; &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I think parents experience do count, you are going to need it as you go <br/>\nalong. My experience is what tells me that this lifestyle is the right one for <br/>\nmy family because I have also lived the other lifestyle, the school lifestyle <br/>\nand saw firsthand what an ill fit that was for the whole family. I can&#39;t go <br/>\nback and redo the past but I can learn from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally don&#39;t think it is a 4 and 7yro&#39;s responsibility to understand <br/>\nthat their education belongs to them, they will in time as they grow up, my <br/>\n16yro understands it however not so much in those terms. We only started hsing 5 <br/>\nyears ago, so he was around 11 when we pulled him out of school. In those 5 <br/>\nshort years we have managed to cross the bridge from a public schooled child to a <br/>\nself confident young man who understands far more than I had ever dreamt he <br/>\nwould at this age. We did it a day at a time, talking, laughing, fighting, <br/>\ncrying and even a few shouting matches which we have not had for ages I&#39;m glad to <br/>\nsay. We worked through so many things along the way and the whole family has <br/>\ngrown, not just the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you ask if the kids are scared about the rest being up to them I wonder <br/>\nif you are thinking that you are just going to shove a 7yro out into the <br/>\nworld, why on earth would anyone do that? There are a lot of years to explore life <br/>\nsafely within the family between the age of 7 and adulthood. I am not even <br/>\nshoving my 16yro out I am helping him to find ways to test out the larger world <br/>\nwhile still knowing my hand is there to grab when he needs it and even at 16 <br/>\nthey still need it now and then. He does come to me for guidance, for <br/>\nreassurance, trusting me to be here and I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do however encourage him to try new things, to stretch and grow, to taste <br/>\nlife so that he can eventually have the confidence he needs to be his own <br/>\nperson. I want him to always want us around and to always love us but I want him to <br/>\nbe self sufficient because I think that is healthy. I love seeing that in my <br/>\n21yro son, he is so powerful now, school was not kind to him but he has <br/>\novercome it and it is exciting to see.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould it be that it all boils down to trust? We have to trust ourselves first <br/>\nto do the right thing and then we can trust that our kids will find the way.<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":79793286,"authorName":"rachel_foodie","from":"&quot;rachel_foodie&quot; &lt;rachel_foodie@...&gt;","profile":"rachel_foodie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: interesting questions from my husband","postDate":"1074748201","msgId":89683,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJ1bmx2OSt2OWxtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDgxOTYyMjRBLTRDODUtMTFEOC1CNURFLTAwMDM5M0I4NEZCNkBjdWx0dXJla2l0Y2hlbi5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":89682,"nextInTopic":89685,"prevInTime":89682,"nextInTime":89684,"topicId":89671,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...  wrote: my ... that ...

But, lo and behold, no squirrels showed up, <br/>\nbut lots of birds did.  Andrew and I have been fascinated by all of <br/>\nthem and watching how different types of birds have different <br/>\npersonalities.  So that has been really fun.

Wrong<br/>\n<br/>\ni am basically giving him keywords to use throughout the archives. very <br/>\ninteresting posts will pop-out for him. I am sure that Sandra has <br/>\ntimely articles on her website as well. another word to look for is:<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Semantics<br/>\n<br/>\nit has been discussed many times in this here list the importance of <br/>\nsemantics. that there is a difference between saying &quot;kids learn&quot; vs. <br/>\n&quot;kids teach themselves&quot; or the difference between &quot;learning&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;education&quot;. take away right and wrong from the previous keywords list, <br/>\nand we may not be talking about the same thing when using the 5 first <br/>\nitems. i have an idea what it means to you, but defining these terms by <br/>\nyourself and clarifying what they mean to you intellectually and, most <br/>\nimportantly, emotionally may be what makes you look at unschooling as <br/>\nsomething you &#39;can&#39;t buy&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhich, in effect, *we all can&#39;t buy* because it is not something to <br/>\nbuy, it is a process, a life compass.<br/>\n<br/>\nfurther down the post, i read this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do they know now, what we have only figured out recently, the <br/>\n&gt; kinds of thing one needs to know so that having the life you want is <br/>\n&gt; easier to live?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my first reaction to this is, how lucky he is that he has figured out <br/>\nhow to live life. i do not say this lightly or in an off-putting way. i <br/>\nwish i could live with that certainty --i do not. but i was the kind of <br/>\nchild that wanted to grow up to be like leonardo divinci, learning all <br/>\nthe time. so, i am truly marveled when i hear people say that they&#39;ve <br/>\nfigured life out. it&#39;s too big a thing for me to process <br/>\nintellectually, needless to say emotionally.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Don&#39;t parents&#39; experiences count for something when raising their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of course they do. unschooling is not neglect, benign or otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How can someone who is 4 or 7 even understand that their education <br/>\n&gt; belongs to them,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but they don&#39;t. i don&#39;t even think that word, education, is in either <br/>\nof my son&#39;s vocabularies and they will happen to be 4 and 7 this year. <br/>\nas they like to quote from the &#39;Tony Hawk Gigantic Tour&#39; videos: I&#39;m <br/>\njust here to be (imagine an almost 4 year old with an Elmer Fudd lisp <br/>\nsaying that. It&#39;s really funny).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; aren&#39;t we supposed to be here to help them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ABSOLUTELY! Another search word for y&#39;all:<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Strewing<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is raising kids just about giving them food, shelter and love, the <br/>\n&gt; rest is just up to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>search the archives using the aforementioned keyword and you&#39;ll read <br/>\nwhat i mean :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Wouldn&#39;t that feel scary to a kid that it is up to them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to live freely? to be freely?<br/>\n<br/>\n10.

I have posted a few things <br/>\nhere.  I have spent the last week reading through archives, so I <br/>\ncould get a better feel for this group. At first, I had a knee jerk <br/>\nreaction to an answer Sandra gave someone and sent a shocked response <br/>\nto her not, thankfully Deb L. caught it.  (Thanks) I wasn&#39;t the one <br/>\nwho posted &quot;the&quot; attack email to Sandra that she has recently written about. Like everyone said, this is <br/>\na place that you don&#39;t want to throw something out there unless you <br/>\nare prepared to see it challenged.  So here goes.  The following <br/>\ncomes from my husband.  We were having a really nice conversation on <br/>\nunschooling vs.relaxed homeschooling. He threw out an interesting <br/>\ncomment/question. I can&#39;t wait to hear what everyone has to say (his remarks are<br/>\nin blue.)<br/>\n               <br/>\nHe said,**** &quot;Has anyone ever unschooled their kids and because their <br/>\nkids were lazy, or totally disinterested in things they might need to <br/>\nknow to make an actual living, or unschooling failed those kids?&quot; Is <br/>\nit really wrong to have any expectations of one&#39;s kids. And I am not <br/>\ntalking about making a living one person wants to live on.  What if <br/>\nour kids want to get married and have kids, and wants them to be <br/>\nhomeschooled/unschooled and they can&#39;t make the money to that.  <br/>\nWouldn&#39;t we have failed our kids? Isn&#39;t there a list out there called <br/>\nUnschooling Disaster Stories?&quot;  Not everything works for everybody.&quot;<br/>\nThen he went on to say, &quot;You know that I love our kids as much as you <br/>\ndo. They are our children.  It&#39;s makes me sad that you are so <br/>\ndisappointed in me not just agreeing with you.  I can see your point <br/>\nand where you are coming from, but I just don&#39;t know if I buy the <br/>\nwhole unschooling thing like you do. How do we raise &#39;our&#39; children <br/>\nbeing far apart on such an integral issue? I know you love me, and I <br/>\nlove you, but you seem more disappointed that I don&#39;t agree with you, <br/>\nand I am not disappointed that you don&#39;t agree with me.&quot;*******<br/>\n  <br/>\nSome of my responses were to tell him that I thought having expectations that our kids pursue what they love and will find those things out when ready are good expectations. That if our kids made a commitment to some kind of activity and wanted to stop, not because they didn&#39;t like it anymore, but because it was becoming harder or more challenging, that it might be a good thing to expect them to really give it some thought before totally giving up (not that that would stop them from giving up anyway).  I remember thinking back in my 20s  how I wished my parents had pushed me to stay with the Cello. (I give up on alot of stuff of my own admittance) because I might be a great player. But upon thinking about it,  I realized that &quot;might&quot; be a great cellist,isn&#39;t a good enough reason for my parents pushing me.  Clearly, I had other things on my mind. I did tell him that once I read on a local homeschooling list about a mom who&#39;s unschooled son really wanted to go to a certain college, or<br/>\n get into a certain collegiate program (??), and couldn&#39;t get in because his math abilities were atrocious. The mom was questioning that maybe she should have &quot;taught&quot;him stuff. Her kid was blaming her for his limited ability. He actually told her it was her fault he didn&#39;t know what he should. I said that our kids education has to belong to them. My husband said, &quot;How do they know now, what we have only figured out recently, the kinds of thing one needs to know so that having the life you want is easier to live? Don&#39;t parents&#39; experiences count for something when raising their kids. How can someone who is 4 or 7 even understand that their education belongs to them, aren&#39;t we supposed to be here to help them? Is raising kids just about giving them food, shelter and love, the rest is just up to them.  Wouldn&#39;t that feel scary to a kid that it is up to them?&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\nOk, so there you have it. There was more, alot more that we both said. But this was the most important stuff he spoke about.  My husband is a thoughtful,caring, very intelligent guy. He can keep his calm and I am the passionate zealot. BUT, I was really calm and chilled out during this talk ( a good thing). <br/>\nAnyway, I would really love to hear what the more experienced unschoolers out there have to say about this. Please don&#39;t write my husband off as some ignorant, intolerant, control freak. That isn&#39;t what this is about. It is about a true curiosity and genuine concern for his kids&#39; futures.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nRachel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Never put off until tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow.<br/>\n -Mark Twain<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
