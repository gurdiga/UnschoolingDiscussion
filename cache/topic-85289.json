I agree <br/>\n&quot;crux&quot; captures what the early years were like with our two children.<br/>\n<br/>\n       As an older than average mom with a career behind me, just having <br/>\nbabies and being home with them was heaven. <br/>\n<br/>\n      But our new family were confronted with crisis after crisis. We lost my <br/>\nown mom and dad plus DH&#39;s dad. DH fell off the roof during a storm and took <br/>\nmonths to recover while I cared for both him and our toddler, with no family <br/>\nmembers to help.  I had emergency surgery that separated me as a nursing mom <br/>\nfrom the new baby. The next year, when that baby was 13 months old and I had my <br/>\nback turned with laundry, he managed to open the porch door. Less than one <br/>\nminute later, he was facedown in the swimming pool. We somehow survived that with <br/>\nno permanent damage. Then on a Sunday afternoon outing, all four of us were <br/>\nblindsided by a teen driver who totaled our minivan and wrecked our peace of <br/>\nmind, too. <br/>\n<br/>\n         Maybe &quot;crisis&quot; comes from the same root as &quot;crossing&quot; and &quot;crux?&quot; I <br/>\nshould go look that up. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n       None of it could be blamed on anyone -- least of all the children, who <br/>\nby comparison seemed almost miraculously perfect to me in every way, no <br/>\nmatter what they did or didn&#39;t do, or when they did or didn&#39;t do it. <br/>\n<br/>\n       I just loved being with them, in a moment-to-moment kind of way that <br/>\nwas completely out of character for me in Life Before Parenthood. I am a <br/>\nprofessional educator, but I sure wasn&#39;t &quot;teaching&quot; or controlling their learning, <br/>\nmuch less their development. I felt like we were lucky we were all still alive <br/>\nand together! DH and I just had so much to deal with and worry about, that we <br/>\ndidn&#39;t buy curriculum or do phonics or anything schooly, or obsess about <br/>\nfinding a preschool or other programs. <br/>\n<br/>\n       So those early years were un-schooled, not in name or by design or <br/>\nintent. Yet both children were early self-taught readers, happy, curious, <br/>\ncompetent, confident, kind. And still are. :)  <br/>\n       <br/>\n       I&#39;m grateful because they&#39;re so great, but also I suspect they&#39;re <br/>\ngreat because I&#39;m so grateful for them. <br/>\n<br/>\n       Without all the crisis in their early years to distract my own <br/>\noverdeveloped, task-oriented, first-born drive to achieve and control -- and to focus <br/>\nme on pure appreciation of their existence -- I can&#39;t say whether we would <br/>\nhave discovered the unschooling lifestyle that turned out to be so right for us. <br/>\nSomehow we stumbled on it in the crucible of burning away everything else. <br/>\n(crucible -- from the same root as crux, I&#39;ll bet! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n        JJ<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85034,"nextTopicId":85084}}
