I have <br/>\nactually stopped being a member due the narrowness of their <br/>\nstatement of faith. But one of the moms who was speaking that <br/>\nnight asked me to come to hear her, so I went as a visitor.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring one part of the evening, each mother was invited to share <br/>\nabout herself and her homeschool experience. By the end, I was <br/>\namazed at how much *this* list has changed how I think about <br/>\nschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nComments:<br/>\n&quot;I used to be really chaotic in how I approached school but it <br/>\ndrove my kids crazy. They just wanted to know what to do and <br/>\nwhen they could be done, so we use text books now. They like <br/>\nthe structure.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I need order and structure. I really like knowing what we have to <br/>\ndo and when so I can check it off.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve already threatened to send my kids back to school and it&#39;s <br/>\nonly the second week!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was much discussion about the role of text books. Several <br/>\ntalked about how they (the mothers) tried to be less structured <br/>\nand more fun but the kids got frustrated and asked for text books. <br/>\nThis got loads of laughter. Apparently it&#39;s a common occurrence <br/>\nfor these kids to not enjoy the more random approach to <br/>\n&quot;school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I could think was that these &quot;chaotic days&quot; of homeschool <br/>\nmust still have included stuff the kids *didn&#39;t want to do*  or &quot;had <br/>\nto do&quot; and the easiest way to get that done was to do the text <br/>\nbook format so they could know they could move on to other <br/>\ninterests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe words &quot;what to do&quot; and &quot;to be done&quot; came up over and over <br/>\nagain. I wanted to shout: &quot;Why would anyone just want to &quot;do&quot; <br/>\nschool? What happened to enjoying learning and life together?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to this list we&#39;re living a completely different reality... <br/>\nwhich I shared when it was my turn. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80397,"nextTopicId":36147}}
