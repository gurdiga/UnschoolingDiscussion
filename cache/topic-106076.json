I registered years ago and someone contacted me  there <br/>\nyesterday and responded to my response so I had to go back.  I was  wishing <br/>\nshe had just used e-mail, BUT... there are a couple of really  interesting <br/>\nthings there.<br/>\n <br/>\nOne is a graph predicting the growth of homeschooling and  the [downfall, or <br/>\nslack-off] of school.  The cool thing is there  are slider bars for all the <br/>\nvariables, so you can adjust the rates of change  according to your own <br/>\npredictions.  (He was an engineer before retirement  and it&#39;s a cool mathy thing with <br/>\nthe explanations down below.)<br/>\n <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolmedia.net/model/index.phtml_\">http://www.homeschoolmedia.net/model/index.phtml_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolmedia.net/model/index.phtml)\">http://www.homeschoolmedia.net/model/index.phtml)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\nThe other really cool thing is that on his bio page the photo moves, kinda  <br/>\nlike the photos Harry Potter sees on collecting cards and newspapers.<br/>\n <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolmedia.net/dave/index.phtml_\">http://www.homeschoolmedia.net/dave/index.phtml_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolmedia.net/dave/index.phtml)\">http://www.homeschoolmedia.net/dave/index.phtml)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\nHe has radio shows there for download (like talks he&#39;s given, it seems) but  <br/>\nthey won&#39;t play on a Mac.  He&#39;s pro-unschooling.  I might not mess  with it <br/>\nanymore, but I thought that graph, especially, was fun and some of  you might <br/>\nhave friends or relatives who would be appeased by  it (and by a  website by <br/>\nsomeone who&#39;s not &quot;just a mom&quot;).<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106072,"nextTopicId":106073}}
