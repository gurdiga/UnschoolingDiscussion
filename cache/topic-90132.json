I insulted you and my insult was unwarranted and came from a place of <br/>\nignorance.  I apologize sincerely.  I hope that you will forgive me.  I am <br/>\nwholly sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then, I have done a lot more reading and a lot less talking/posting.  I <br/>\nhave come to a much fuller understanding of unschooling.  I still have some <br/>\nquestions, but I can understand where so many of the long-time unschoolers are <br/>\ncoming from, and how dedicated you are to helping people enjoy the lifestyle <br/>\nwithout regret and worry.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had wanted to write you an apology some time ago, but never did--obviously. <br/>\n It was your post today, which actually brought tears to my eyes for much of <br/>\nit, that reminded me to waste no more time and set my thoughts down and send <br/>\nthem to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour post about your experience with television and your boys is so <br/>\ninspirational.  I still feel slightly scared about it, but I&#39;m not writing for you to <br/>\ngive me.... I&#39;m writing really just to apologize.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for taking the time to write this post.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarm regards,******<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90130,"nextTopicId":89873}}
