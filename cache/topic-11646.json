I know Beth Wecht, a <br/>\nmember of this list, lives somewhere out your way, so she may be able to <br/>\noffer more info than I.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might also try contacting this woman to see if she can be of any help:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:camillebauer25@...\">camillebauer25@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if that&#39;s an active email address or not, I got it off the <br/>\nMaryland Unschoolers site at  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kaligecko.tripod.com/\">http://kaligecko.tripod.com/</a>  which <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t look terribly up to date.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might also find the following email lists helpful (not sure where <br/>\nelse you signed up, since this is the only intro I&#39;ve seen):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics</a>  A list geared towards <br/>\nnewbies and beginner&#39;s questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled</a>  A list geared towards <br/>\nunschooling young children--till around age 8--where I know there are at <br/>\nleast two single moms who might be helpful (yep, count me as another <br/>\nshameless self-promoter!)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling in Maryland is very easy. Reviews vary from county to <br/>\ncounty, though they tend to be pretty relaxed for the early years, so <br/>\ndon&#39;t panic about curriculum. The easiest way of all to Unschool in <br/>\nMaryland is to join an Unschooling-friendly umbrella organization like <br/>\nNew Creation Academy, run by Wendy Bush--this is the one I use. I choose <br/>\nthe peer review option, which costs only $75 per year for my <br/>\n*family*--not a per child charge--and that allows me to review only once <br/>\na year instead of twice with the county and I review with another <br/>\nUnschooler in my area.

It seems unlikely<br/>\nthat 5 year olds would be doing so. At least my 5 yo would have absolutely<br/>\nzero interest in the idea of limiting herself with a daily plan.

If anyone has experience with twins I&#39;d really appreciate <br/>\nhearing from you.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the greatest things about Unschooling is that it allows us to honor<br/>\nthe individuality, quirkiness, special brilliance of our children without<br/>\nreference to charts, bell curves, competitions or milestones. Sometimes it<br/>\nseems like curriculum using home schoolers, who are mimicking school<br/>\nschedules, treat close in age siblings as if they were one entity with two<br/>\nheads. It&#39;s great that you are free from that phenomenon.<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My ex-husband has been very supportive of me keeping the girls out of <br/>\nschool, but now he&#39;s really starting to push the idea of enrolling <br/>\nthem in kindergarten just so they can meet some other children.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are able to reassure him that you have taken steps to meet others<br/>\nlocally, he may feel better and stop pressuring you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I don&#39;t <br/>\nworry about &#39;basics,&#39; because what might be basic to me isn&#39;t <br/>\nnecessarily basic to my kids.  Dd1, (nearly 5yo) for example, is <br/>\ngetting into reading and writing, she was asking me how to spell <br/>\nsomething.  I was trying to tell her that if you think about how you <br/>\nsay the word, then take the letters that make those sounds, then <br/>\nwrite it down, you will have that word, and she just doesn&#39;t want to <br/>\nknow it.  What could be more &#39;basic&#39; than phonics?  Anyway, I&#39;m <br/>\nrambling.

I read every <br/>\nbook I could on unschooling, typed the word &quot;unschooling, unschooler, <br/>\nunschooled&quot; into AOL, Yahoo, Snap.com and every other search engine I could <br/>\nfind... I went to Barnes and Noble, Borders (sorry guys), Amazon.com etc etc <br/>\nuntil I felt I couldn&#39;t learn anything more before making a decision (which <br/>\nof course I could)... This whole exercise in it&#39;self is unschooling... When I <br/>\nam interested in learning about something I will ask questions, do research, <br/>\ncontact other people and have all my &quot;stuff&quot; in front of me and then be able <br/>\nto make decisions about what I want to keep and what I want to throw away.... <br/>\nsame as unschooling...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son spent 5 hours on the computer yesterday (5 years old) playing Madeline <br/>\n2nd Grade Math (which he knows how to do) in conjunction with using his <br/>\ndinosaurs to count so that he can add things up (ever seen 75 + 27 dinosaurs <br/>\nlaid out on the bedroom floor before!!!)...  I kept asking him if he (a) <br/>\nwanted help to which he replied &quot;no thanks mum, just juice&quot; and (b) would you <br/>\nlike to do something else to which he replied &quot;no thanks mum, just a Pnut <br/>\nButter and Jelly Sandwick (which he had at the kitchen table)....He then got <br/>\nout his number game (that&#39;s what he calls it) and puts all the cards in order <br/>\nand starts chosing ones he wants to add and subtract.. He&#39;s been on the math <br/>\nkick for a couple of weeks now... Soon he&#39;ll move on.... He asked about <br/>\nletters and reading yesterday afternoon and I asked him if he wanted to learn <br/>\nto read.  he said yes, so now I have to figure out how to do that... Someone <br/>\nsuggested a phonics books for the sounds... I&#39;m only interested in using <br/>\nthose as a jumping off point... I think we&#39;ll go around the house and write <br/>\nthe words of all the appliances,  etc... DS just came into my office and I <br/>\ntold him we were going to do that and he said &quot;can we write the word DOG&quot;  <br/>\nfavorite word at the moment... I said &quot;we don&#39;t have a dog what shall we <br/>\nstick it on?&quot;  He said &quot;I have a toy SPOT THE DOG, maybe we could stick it on <br/>\nhim&quot;.... There&#39;s unschooling and using your imagination for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway off to make labels....not the kind that say &quot;my child is a honor <br/>\nstudent at blah blah blah school&quot; but the kind that teach him something and <br/>\nhelp his self esteem.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Joseph May","from":"&quot;Joseph May&quot; &lt;j1986@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"vA2pCPTYY9GsgbfR_fn2JArdeXH0NmpULigtgBmonNvb0vJGjuDblJEU0d5vXCrxI6wj-NKpbiHUXqYFif6qpYjQDg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"new to group","postDate":"966053875","msgId":11935,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGIwMWMwMDQxNCQ0YjM5YTU2MCRmYWExODBkMUBmcGZ6cWxnYT4="},"prevInTopic":11646,"nextInTopic":11945,"prevInTime":11934,"nextInTime":11936,"topicId":11646,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I have been homeschooling my boys 6, 8 for about a year.
