Kind of like  <br/>\nDorothy in the movie version of The Wizard of Oz.  But her life  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t all that great before she had the experiences (real or  <br/>\nimagined).  So if her experiences were head-bonk-and-fright-induced  <br/>\ndelirium, still she had extreme thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\n=So don&#39;t try to &quot;get it&quot;, just BE. And there will be your answer.<br/>\nThank you-I&#39;ll work on that. No, I won&#39;t... I&#39;ll... keep it at the  <br/>\nforefront<br/>\nof my mind/thinking :~)=<br/>\n<br/>\nJust be emotionally alert and relaxed.<br/>\nNot emotionally zingy and raw, but while you&#39;re thinking, think about  <br/>\nyour emotions, and how they feel.  If you get angry really easily, be  <br/>\naware of that and also aware of what soothes you (internally).  If  <br/>\nyou prefer a state of unsettleness and fear, look back into your past  <br/>\nand see what that might mean.  It might be worth reading about  <br/>\ndysfunctional families if one grew up with parents who were  <br/>\ninconsistent in bad ways (alcohol, drugs, other weirdness), and maybe  <br/>\nin some cases even talking to a counsellor a few times if self-help  <br/>\nbooks or groups can&#39;t do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWork at knowing how it feels to be still, and if it takes a formal  <br/>\npractice (meditation, yoga, prayer, trance-of-some-sort, music- <br/>\ninduced stillness) maybe do that, but when you know what your  <br/>\nstillness feels like you&#39;ll be able to get there on your own more  <br/>\noften, sometimes just by conscious thought, posture, breathing or  <br/>\nsomething.  It&#39;s not just breathing and posture, it&#39;s the thoughts  <br/>\nthat go with it.  Prayer works for some people all by itself, because  <br/>\nof the attitude of awe and humility.  Some people pray without those,  <br/>\nand saying &quot;God grant me patience right now&quot; doesn&#39;t help. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nReading about parenting can be helpful, but I figure people who find  <br/>\na list like this have done lots of that, and now are doing more.   <br/>\nReading bad examples and good examples and running those through our  <br/>\nown memories and filters can help.  Knowing what we want NOT to do is  <br/>\nas important as having a good model or ideal to aim toward.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading doesn&#39;t do it for some people.  Some people run, or hike, and  <br/>\nthe change of scene, and the rhythm, and the endorphins, and the  <br/>\nopportunity to be without outside verbal input helps them sort and  <br/>\nclarify.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that helped me every time was to smell a  young child&#39;s  <br/>\nhead.  It helps less with teens than it did with young children (and  <br/>\nbabies&#39; heads can be intoxicating for moms, which is good!).  One  <br/>\nlong slow deep breath filled with the smell of my own child&#39;s head  <br/>\nwas a centering, focussing thing for me.   It won&#39;t work for  <br/>\neveryone.  Acrimonious divorces and kids who smell like the dad can  <br/>\nbe a problem, I think, and anything that works against the increase  <br/>\nof peace should probably be avoided.   Smells aren&#39;t talked about  <br/>\nmuch in our culture, except in the ways we spend money and effort to  <br/>\nmask our smells.  There&#39;s a whole lot going on in the olfactory  <br/>\nrealm, but English speakers especially seem to like to reject it and  <br/>\ninsult any who do base anything on smell.  It&#39;s one of our biggest  <br/>\nbastions of ignorance, and won&#39;t be changed in my lifetime.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry not to make conditions like &quot;I will work on being more mindful  <br/>\nwhen my whole house is clean&quot; or &quot;After we finish remodelling&quot; or  <br/>\n&quot;After we move&quot; or &quot;When my irritating relatives move away.&quot;  When  <br/>\nthat happens, it&#39;s almost like co-dependency, or like blackmailing  <br/>\nour own souls.  Mindfulness can increase under any circumstances once  <br/>\nthe person is at a point to understand it as a thing to be desired.    <br/>\nBefore that point, it can&#39;t be increased at all.   And the Maslow  <br/>\nheirarchy of needs comes into play too.  It helps  to have basic  <br/>\nneeds met before spiritual or emotional learning/growth.  On the  <br/>\nother hand, though, prisoners and trauma victims sometimes become  <br/>\nvery spiritual and philosophical.   There are unknowns, and  <br/>\nindividual differences.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77070457,"authorName":"Sanguinegirl83@aol.com","from":"Sanguinegirl83@...","profile":"sanguinegirl83","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] mindfulness","postDate":"1138450502","msgId":111531,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJlMy4xNGNmYjQzLjMxMGNiYTQ2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":111530,"nextInTopic":111534,"prevInTime":111530,"nextInTime":111532,"topicId":111492,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/27/2006 5:28:05 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...
