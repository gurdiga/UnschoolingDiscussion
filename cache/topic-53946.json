Usually <br/>\nonce or twice a week while I swim or take a yoga class<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Childcare swapping with other homeschooling families. Sometimes <br/>\nthis takes the form of a dropoff playdate. Sometimes we get 3 or 4 <br/>\nmoms together and we take turns doing something like going for walks <br/>\ntogether while the other moms are with the kids - 30 minutes at a <br/>\ntime. In the summer, we would have a group of 3 or 4 families go to <br/>\nthe beach or to the lake and we&#39;d take turns hiking, bike riding, <br/>\nrunning, or swimming. <br/>\n<br/>\n4) Time when the kids are home - this is trickier. We have a family <br/>\nmovie night once a week, and usually the next morning the kids want <br/>\nto watch the movie again before we turn it in. They watch it as a DVD <br/>\non my computer upstairs. I&#39;ve started using this time to rent movies <br/>\nthat my DH doesn&#39;t want to see, and I go downstairs and ride my <br/>\nbicycle on my indoor trainer while I watch a movie on the TV down <br/>\nthere. The kids usually come down once or twice in the hour and a <br/>\nhalf, but that&#39;s better than trying to constantly answer questions <br/>\nwhen I&#39;m sweating and out of breath.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, I try to be creative, but I always make time each day for <br/>\nmyself and my own goals. It&#39;s important for me, since I have things I <br/>\nwant to accomplish that I can&#39;t always do with the kids, and I think <br/>\nit&#39;s also important to the kids. They like the fact that I do my <br/>\nthings too, and they like to share with me when they can (like when I <br/>\nread my writing out loud to edit it, my son loves to listen, and they <br/>\nboth like to come and watch when I compete in triathlons). When I&#39;m <br/>\nnot with them, they get to spend one-on-one time with their dad, <br/>\nwhich lets him be a more integral part of their lives, and when <br/>\nthat&#39;s not possible, I try to make sure they&#39;re somewhere that they <br/>\nwant to be (with friends, etc.)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Time to yourself","postDate":"1042135661","msgId":54083,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYzN0tCVDdYVkxTRWNGRGNRS3YwMDAyOTNlMUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":54064,"nextInTopic":54098,"prevInTime":54082,"nextInTime":54084,"topicId":53946,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
