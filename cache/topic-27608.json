I started<br/>\nbabysitting my<br/>\nlittle brother when I was 8.  Now maybe it is different now<br/>\nthan in<br/>\nthe late 70s but when I was little most everybody was a<br/>\nbabysitting <br/>\npro by the time they hit 11 or 12.  <br/>\nI really think it is a matter of case by case.  You have to<br/>\nknow your <br/>\nchild and their level of maturity.  I have met very mature<br/>\n10 year olds and<br/>\nincredibly immature 30 year olds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the time same time I think that if you feel very<br/>\nstrongly that your neighbor<br/>\nis behaving irresponsibly toward his children and<br/>\nabandoning them why <br/>\nnot confront him?  It maybe that you are right but it may<br/>\nalso be that if you<br/>\nconfront him with your perceptions he may adjust his.<br/>\nAlso, while I&#39;m sure the <br/>\nlittle boy you spoke with is a nice kid, he is just that.<br/>\nHe may not have all the facts or he may have them but<br/>\nsimply not have shared them with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, hope this helps :)  take care, Jacli<br/>\n<br/>\n*********** REPLY SEPARATOR  ***********<br/>\n<br/>\nOn 11/10/2001 at 12:01 PM<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Message: 20<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   Date: Sat, 10 Nov 2001 20:14:21 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Joseph Fuerst&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuerst@...\">fuerst@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Moral dillema<br/>\n&lt;Hey everybody,<br/>\n&lt;I&#39;m fuming here and need to get some perspective on this<br/>\nsituation before I<br/>\n&lt;make a decsion...
