Is there a wall<br/>\nthese tall presences can look over and see hell?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf an angel fell off a cloud, would he leave a hole<br/>\nin a river and would the hole float along endlessly<br/>\nfilled with the silent letters of every angelic word?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf an angel delivered the mail, would he arrive<br/>\nin a blinding rush of wings or would he just assume<br/>\nthe appearance of the regular mailman and<br/>\nwhistle up the driveway reading the postcards?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, the medieval theologians control the court.<br/>\nThe only question you ever hear is about<br/>\nthe little dance floor on the head of a pin<br/>\nwhere halos are meant to converge and drift invisibly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is designed to make us think in millions,<br/>\nbillions, to make us run out of numbers and collapse<br/>\ninto infinity, but perhaps the answer is simply one:<br/>\none female angel dancing alone in her stocking feet,<br/>\na small jazz combo working in the background.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe sways like a branch in the wind, her beautiful<br/>\neyes closed, and the tall thin bassist leans over<br/>\nto glance at his watch because she has been dancing<br/>\nforever, and now it is very late, even for musicians.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Billy Collins, U.S. poet laureate 2001-2002<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pitt.edu/~press/1999/collinsqaa.html\">http://www.pitt.edu/~press/1999/collinsqaa.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39168,"nextTopicId":39178}}
