I joined a few weeks ago and have been reading the posts like it was suggested to see if I might fit in here. I&#39;m not sure if I do, to tell you the truth. I won&#39;t post often but keep reading, if I may. I&#39;m learning about unschooling and it&#39;s very, very new to me. Most people I know who say they are unschoolers still use worksheets for some things, or use a basic curriculum to follow during the year, but are very easy on the children and ease  them into their studies and it takes them a good year or so to get through the curriculum. So... this total unschooling thing  I&#39;m really still just trying to learn about  and be more open to being, well, open.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m Susan and I have a 12 year old son. We&#39;ve been learning at home for a little over three years now. We are using a curriculum right now... but like I said, I&#39;m new to getting to understand the unschooling thing. I just got a couple of books by John Holt. I&#39;ve read Dumbing Us Down and A Different Kind of Teacher by John Taylor Gatto, and must admit, he&#39;s been the most incredible source of inspiration and fuel for my fire to home learn. I am currently reading The Underground History of American Education. That&#39;s extremely informative and thought provoking as well. I really think those three books have a lot of incredibly important information for any parent interested in their children&#39;s present and future. <br/>\n <br/>\nI hope no one minds if I do jump in on a couple of the threads going on in here right now. I was interested in someof the topics.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nSusan <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!
