Bake a different  kind<br/>\nevery day, with the children helping all along and then setting out the<br/>\nplate each afternoon to be eaten before the next day? You could put<br/>\npeppermint  chips in sugar cookies the first day, then use green food<br/>\ncoloring, etc and  lead up to shape cookies and sprinkles as the Big Day<br/>\nnears.<br/>\n Hmm --  JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a recipe for pinwheels to make at advent.<br/>\n<br/>\n6oz sugar<br/>\n4oz soft butter<br/>\n1 beaten egg<br/>\n1 tsp vanilla<br/>\n6oz SR flour, sifted with a pinch of salt<br/>\n1oz plain chocolate<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd sugar to creamed butter, blending it until light. Mix in beaten egg and<br/>\nvanilla, then add flour.<br/>\nNow divide the dough in half. Add to one half, 1oz melted chocolate. If the<br/>\ndough seems soft, chill for awhile until it can be easily rolled. Then roll<br/>\nthe plain and chocolate doughs separately into oblongs, the thickness of<br/>\n1/8&quot;. Place the chocolate dough on top of the plain one and carefully roll<br/>\nthe layers up like a swiss roll. Cut your cookies off the roll end, place on<br/>\na greased baking sheet, bake at 400F for 8-10 minutes. Allow to cool on cake<br/>\nracks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have been longing for Christmas to come since October!! So we are<br/>\ndefinitely celebrating Advent this year. I made up a calendar for Nov/Dec<br/>\nand the kids decorated it with Christmassy things and  have been crossing<br/>\noff the days to go. We are putting up the tree tomorrow and then on the 6th<br/>\nwe will celebrate Samichlaus-read a story of St Nicholas and have a little<br/>\npresent/treat waiting for them in the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt breaks the time up. Waiting 1 day to put the tree up then 7 days to<br/>\nSamichlaus....much easier than waiting 27 days till Christmas. I think<br/>\nhelping them to buy small presents for  one another and wrapping them up<br/>\nsecretly helps them to understand how we feel about giving gifts to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
