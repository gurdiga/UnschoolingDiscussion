November 18, 1978. I remember because for years and <br/>\nyears and YEARS I would hear on the radio sometime during the day on my <br/>\nbirthday &quot;And on this date in 1978 Jim Jones...&quot;. Oh and I probably wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nremember the 1978 part except that my oldest son was about six months old then and I <br/>\nremember walking around carrying him thinking of all those children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if my youngest kids would get the kool-aid reference? <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109756,"nextTopicId":109804}}
