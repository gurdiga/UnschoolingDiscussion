He seems to take a phonic-like <br/>\napproach in sounding words out as he goes along. I don&#39;t have a clue <br/>\nat what age he will become a fluent/proficient reader, but he seems <br/>\nto be approaching it in large spurts at times and then plateaus off <br/>\nfor awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is already sight-reading lots of words (she&#39;s 3) (the <br/>\nother day she read the word &quot;organic&quot; from a label) and I have a <br/>\nfeeling that she might learn to read like I did. I learned to read at <br/>\nage 4, just from my parents reading out loud to me. One day I just <br/>\nrealized that I knew what all the words were. At first, I think my <br/>\nparents thought that I had just memorized everything, but I was <br/>\nreally reading it. By the time I entered first grade, I was reading <br/>\nadult chapter books, so they put me in a 4th grade reading class. I&#39;m <br/>\nguessing that my daughter&#39;s brain works the same as mine, because she <br/>\nseems to have a lot of our books &quot;memorized&quot; and I&#39;m guessing that <br/>\nwill probably someday just click into reading for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just recently read an interesting article about brain research and <br/>\nhow they&#39;ve discovered that there&#39;s two major groups of readers. I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to paraphrase this really badly from my poor recollection, but <br/>\nfrom what I recall, in one type of people, the words go directly to <br/>\none spot in their brain with no translation. I would say this is how <br/>\nI read - I&#39;m not really even aware of the words I&#39;m reading, I just <br/>\nsee the pictures in my head, kind of like thoughts, and I read really <br/>\nfast. For me, listening to books on tape are a form of torture, <br/>\nbecause I actually hear the words, which I don&#39;t when I&#39;m reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the other type of reader, the words actually have to be <br/>\ntranslated in another part of the brain first. They determined this <br/>\nvia MRIs I believe. In the study, they showed that these types <br/>\nof readers were pervasive throughout their lives. I saw it as more <br/>\nevidence that it makes absolutely no sense to push kids to read early <br/>\nwhen they&#39;re obviously not ready for it. If you have a kid whose <br/>\nbrain is the decoding type, they&#39;re going to seem like a &quot;late&quot; <br/>\nreader, but in reality their brain has to take more steps to read, it <br/>\nhas to go through this whole translation scheme. Other kids just seem <br/>\nto get it via osmosis, and those are probably the early readers, and <br/>\npeople who are very fast readers in later life. There&#39;s not anything <br/>\ninherently &quot;better&quot; or &quot;smarter&quot; about these people, they just have a <br/>\ndifferent brain setup with regards to this one skill of reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d hazard a guess that the &quot;translator&quot; kind of reader is more <br/>\ncommon than the &quot;straight through&quot; type of reader, therefore it would <br/>\nbe more likely for unschoolers to read later than the norm if more of <br/>\nthem have to pick up these translating skills without being <br/>\narbitrarily forced to do it early, before their brains are ready to <br/>\ndo it easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I felt really sad about is how many kids are convinced that <br/>\nthey&#39;re stupid because they can&#39;t read at age 7, or whenever our <br/>\nschool system says that they should, when maybe they just have this <br/>\ntotally different brain pattern than the early readers.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"early unschooled readers","postDate":"1046145027","msgId":59546,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0Zi4xYzM0NmNkNC4yYjhjNDIwM0Bjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59551,"prevInTime":59545,"nextInTime":59547,"topicId":59546,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/24/03 5:41:17 PM Central Standard Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes:  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1389358826\">In a message dated 2/24/03 5:41:17 PM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; &gt; &lt;&lt; Or are there lots of early unschooled readers<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; too, and we just aren&#39;t hearing those stories? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t necessarily call Sierra an &quot;early&quot; reader, I&#39;m assuming you mean <br/>\nchildren under five.
