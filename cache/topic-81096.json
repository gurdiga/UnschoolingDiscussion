I think the groups philosophy (trusting your body to fulfill its<br/>\nnatural function, paying attention to your baby instead of the clock or what<br/>\nsociety tells you is&quot;normal&quot;, loving guidance instead of punishment, people<br/>\nbefore things, etc.) is very much in accord with unschooling.<br/>\nI would strongly suggest attending meetings during pregnancy, especially if<br/>\nyou had any problems breastfeeding before or think you migyht be<br/>\nuncomfortable nursing in public, are concerned about nutrition, sleeping<br/>\narrangements, etc. It is just such a confidence builder to be around other<br/>\nmoms and their gorgeous, healthy  breastfed kids, and know that you can do<br/>\nit too!<br/>\n About nursing in public......I had my &quot;lightbulb&quot; moment on the Tokyo<br/>\nsubway when my son was about 4 months old (and yes nursing constantly! Some<br/>\nbabies indeed, are just like that and it does not mean you aren&#39;t producing<br/>\nenough milk). I glanced around as he started fussing for the breast, and<br/>\nnoticed that the man next to me was reading a pornographic manga with lots<br/>\nof booby pictures and more(very very common in Japan, they&#39;ll read them on<br/>\npublic transportation because they are ashamed to take them home and upset<br/>\ntheir wives!) At that moment I just decided that if he could look at women&#39;s<br/>\nbodies in a sexual context in a public place and no one around us batted an<br/>\neyelash,<br/>\nI certainly had the right to feed my baby. Never looked back. I&#39;ve gotten a<br/>\nfew stares but no negative comments, Once when a dirty old man was staring<br/>\nat me in a park I smiled and said loudly &quot;Wait your turn!&quot; and he was so<br/>\nembarrassed he disappeared.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch later I was in a restaurant and a woman had a baby who just cried and<br/>\ncried while she got ready to nurse him. She had this big beach towel which<br/>\nshe fastened around herself with a clothes pin, and since it ws dark, hot,<br/>\nand uncomfortable under there, the baby kept  crying and it took forever to<br/>\nlatch on. It was so much more conspicuous and disruptive to the other<br/>\npatrons than if she had just lifted up her<br/>\nshirt and continued eating her lunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and Olga, my take on &quot;Where to look when a baby is breastfeeding&quot; is<br/>\nwhereever. If the mother is comfortable enough to nurse in front of you she<br/>\nmost likely won&#39;t mind if you happen to see a bit of boob.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHikaru<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81088,"nextTopicId":81114}}
