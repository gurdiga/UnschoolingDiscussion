I actually wrote a<br/>\nwhole essay on it once, which is somewhere on my computer that&#39;s in<br/>\nstorage. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt 2 1/2 the girls across the hall were in K and grade 1, and they came<br/>\nover a lot ot play and would play &quot;school&quot; with her (which she loved,<br/>\nbtw). They taught her to spell &quot;cat&quot; and she would run around saying<br/>\n&quot;C-A-T cat&quot; a lot. I think she already knew most of her letters, I&#39;m not<br/>\nsure, maybe they taught her. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne day right around her third birthday, she was writing &quot;C-A-T&quot; with<br/>\nblocks - not alphabet locks, regular blocks that she was using to form<br/>\nhuge letters. Then something clicked in her little head, she took apart<br/>\nthe C, made an &quot;M&quot; and said, &quot;Look - M-A-T, mat&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few months later she found the BOB books at Borders - we were hanging<br/>\nout there to beat the heat in Phoenix because of air condiioner had<br/>\nbroken. She found them, read the first two at the store, so I bought them<br/>\nand she read the rest over the next few weeks. I think I got the next set<br/>\na few months later but she only read the first one or two, her interest<br/>\nin phonics waned abfter the basic letter sounds and short vowel sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it continued like that for a year or two, she slowly read more but it<br/>\nwas never a big jump... when she was 5 she was reading those Step 2<br/>\nbooks, but it wasn&#39;t until about 6 1/2 when something clicked and she<br/>\ncould suddenly read everything, effortlessly...<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone told me that they had noticed an incresed  interest in writeing<br/>\nbeginning about two years after reading in a lot of unschooled kids, and<br/>\nI&#39;ve kind of seen that. She didn&#39;t want to write anything when she was 7,<br/>\nbut at 8 she&#39;s written some poems, some letters, stuff like that, and<br/>\nbegun a few books (usually by writing 3 or 4 sentences).<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
