I never intentionally<br/>\n&gt; mean to do that.  When I post, it&#39;s usually just to share my experiences.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure that either Tia, Sarah Carothers, Lovemary or Kolleen will be<br/>\n&gt; more help to you than I can be, but I&#39;ll try.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First of all, have you read the standard unschooling books by John Holt,<br/>\n&gt; Grace Llewellyn, etc.?  If you haven&#39;t, you should do so.  Also,<br/>\n&gt; understand what &quot;deschooling&quot; is.  I understand it requires an awful lot<br/>\n&gt; of patience and a lot of time.  It depends on the child, but deschooling<br/>\n&gt; can take years.  Remember he has been in school for close to 10 years,<br/>\n&gt; constantly being told what to do, when to do it, how to do it, how much<br/>\n&gt; time he has to do it in, and, even, with whom to do it.  He&#39;s not used<br/>\n&gt; to self-initiating those types of activities which most people would<br/>\n&gt; consider to be learning activities.  He has been taught for many years<br/>\n&gt; that learning is WORK and that it is unpleasant because it has been<br/>\n&gt; forced upon him.  So, it&#39;s only natural he would have an aversion to<br/>\n&gt; activities that many would consider educational.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling is all about respecting your child&#39;s choices and trusting<br/>\n&gt; the fact that he will learn, on his own, what is best for him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Didn&#39;t you say that your son was into computer programming?  Well, let<br/>\n&gt; him do that - all day long, all year long, if that&#39;s what he wants to<br/>\n&gt; do.  He can learn an awful lot from that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is what unschooling is to me:  I basically leave my kids alone and<br/>\n&gt; let them do what they want to do.  I rarely tell them to do anything<br/>\n&gt; (unless it has to do with their physical health, which is a big factor<br/>\n&gt; with my kids).  I consciously try to involve myself in as many active<br/>\n&gt; (not passive) activities as possible.  I am modeling for my kids.  I<br/>\n&gt; hope they join me, and they often do.  I answer all their questions (and<br/>\n&gt; there are very many of them), which often lead into pretty deep<br/>\n&gt; discussions (these are definitely learning moments).  I find the long<br/>\n&gt; and more interesting discussions are in the car, where they are captive<br/>\n&gt; and have few distractions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will now go through your post and interject my thoughts.  Please don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think I am being critical or I am ridiculing you.  I&#39;m just giving you<br/>\n&gt; my ideas and am trying to help in the best way that I can.  If we don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; answer your questions, then you must keep asking and maybe be more<br/>\n&gt; specific, or word your question in another way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Thursday, December 27, 2001, at 06:53 PM, dljones0 wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get a Life.

Also read Alice Miller&#39;s &quot;Thou Shall Not<br/>\n&gt; Be Aware&quot; (I think that&#39;s the title - it&#39;s been a few years since I read<br/>\n&gt; it).  Sorry if this sounds maudlin, but I have many faults and have had<br/>\n&gt; many failures.  I have analyzed them and tried to figure out where they<br/>\n&gt; came from and how they came about.  Of course, it all stems from my<br/>\n&gt; childhood and my mother&#39;s parenting style which was almost the exact<br/>\n&gt; opposite of unschooling.  I consider unschooling to be more of a style<br/>\n&gt; of parenting (or lifestyle) than purely a method of educating my<br/>\n&gt; children.  Unschooling encourages a child to grow up to be a happy,<br/>\n&gt; self-confident, auto-didactic, self-regulating, self-entertaining,<br/>\n&gt; curious and  a self-assured person.  If a person is lucky enough to have<br/>\n&gt; some or all of those traits then that person&#39;s education will be a<br/>\n&gt; natural and painless part of his/her life and s/he will be learning all<br/>\n&gt; the time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, I have looked at the way I was raised and determined what was done<br/>\n&gt; wrong and have chosen to raise my children in a different way which<br/>\n&gt; happens to be unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++=<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  My son didn&#39;t do well with the traditional school setting,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I think the best thing I can do for him is to try to offer him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some alternatives until we find one that works for him and makes him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; happy. Since quitting school in April, I am wondering if he needs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more time to deschool because academics is just not setting well with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him at all.<br/>\n&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s not even nine months.  I would probably wait at least another<br/>\n&gt; year before I would even think about introducing academics to him again,<br/>\n&gt; if ever.  Deschooling can take a long time and requires a lot of<br/>\n&gt; patience on your part.  You have to totally change your ideas of what<br/>\n&gt; learning really is and how it happens.   Personally, I don&#39;t think that<br/>\n&gt; academics are that important yet at age 14.  He has his whole life ahead<br/>\n&gt; of him to learn those things, if he wishes.<br/>\n&gt; ++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He has just been diagnosed with ADD-inattentive type, so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know that hasn&#39;t helped his self-esteem, and he says he can&#39;t pick<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up a book because he can&#39;t retain anything he reads. That is so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different for him, because he always used to love reading.<br/>\n&gt; ++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; Is he referring to textbook reading or reading for pleasure?   Can he<br/>\n&gt; read some entertaining fiction?  Perhaps you can introduce him to some<br/>\n&gt; books about subjects he has an interest in, like computer programming,<br/>\n&gt; sports (if that&#39;s what he&#39;s into), etc.<br/>\n&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What I would love is encouragement, advice on unschooling, and please<br/>\n&gt; &gt; no ridiculing because it&#39;s not as easy for me to just jump in like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some of the rest of you who have done it for so long.<br/>\n&gt; ++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; I encourage you to read the unschooling books as well as past issues of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;.

I also<br/>\n&gt; hope you stay with this list.  Read the posts and ask as many questions<br/>\n&gt; as you need to.  I think its wonderful you are considering unschooling<br/>\n&gt; for your son.  All children should be so lucky.<br/>\n&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  I really admire<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this way of learning instead of having everything shoved down their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; throats. I grew up thinking we had to be pushed all the time and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; never had the opportunity to just sit back and make the decision on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my own to learn when I wanted to.<br/>\n&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; Yes!  And, not only when you wanted to but also what you wanted to.<br/>\n&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Therefore, it makes me think that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most children need a little bit of a constant push to continue acting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; responsibly, which means doing homework, etc. I thought this was part<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of being a parent and guiding your children to become well behaved,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; responsible adults.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; I think a child can learn about responsibility from watching the parents<br/>\n&gt; do responsible things.  It&#39;s all about modeling.  Kids learn a lot from<br/>\n&gt; that.  They don&#39;t have to be taught.  They just have to see you do it.<br/>\n&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, please explain where I go from here. I&#39;m feeling like backing off<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and letting him do whatever he chooses for a while.<br/>\n&gt; ++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; I think that is exactly what you should do.  Try and relax (I know it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; hard).  Just let him hang out and have fun.  Let him do his computer<br/>\n&gt; programming.  I don&#39;t know what your relationship is like with him, but<br/>\n&gt; do you think you two could do stuff together like go camping or do some<br/>\n&gt; traveling together.  I would spend lots of time with him and maybe see<br/>\n&gt; if you can strengthen your relationship.  Just have lots of fun with him<br/>\n&gt; and FORGET school and academics.  Concentrate on being HAPPY!!!<br/>\n&gt; ++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;ve tried it,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but then I start feeling like he needs to learn, or should I say, do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; academics. My husband&#39;s attitude about that may tend to sway me in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that direction more than I tend to want to go. My son is intelligent,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has big ideas, but has trouble implementing.<br/>\n&gt; +++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; He has big ideas!!!  That&#39;s great!!  I wish I had any ideas at all when<br/>\n&gt; I was 14.  If he has big ideas then he has goals.  He has something in<br/>\n&gt; mind that he wants to accomplish.  I would love to know what his goals<br/>\n&gt; are.  I hope you share them with us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Think back to all the courses you took in high school and all those<br/>\n&gt; hours you spent in the classroom and all that homework you did.  Do you<br/>\n&gt; remember much of it?  Do you really feel that it was all that<br/>\n&gt; important?  I&#39;m sure there were a few things that may have been<br/>\n&gt; worthwhile, but you probably could have learned it on your own in a<br/>\n&gt; fraction of the time it took you to have it forced into you by the<br/>\n&gt; school.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I suggest you think happy and positive thoughts and think about how<br/>\n&gt; lucky your son is that he doesn&#39;t have to waste his time in a school.<br/>\n&gt; Think about how lucky you are to have him around all day.  How you can<br/>\n&gt; enjoy each other&#39;s company, etc.  Join homeschooling groups in your area<br/>\n&gt; and introduce him to new people.  Give him the opportunity to make new<br/>\n&gt; friends.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With regard to your husband, I have the same problem.  I suggest you try<br/>\n&gt; and educate him as best you can about unschooling.  Get a hold of old<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot; magazines, read them and share the articles<br/>\n&gt; with him.  Have them in the bathroom, so he can read them there too.  My<br/>\n&gt; husband has come a long way, but we still have to compromise.  My boys<br/>\n&gt; and I have come out on top though.<br/>\n&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  I think in time,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; however, he will do great things so I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m concerned.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; +++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s lucky to have a mother with so much confidence in him.  Just keep<br/>\n&gt; thinking that way and try to relax.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hope I have helped a little bit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hope you stay on this list.  Ask for support and information.  This<br/>\n&gt; list can be very helpful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mimi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
