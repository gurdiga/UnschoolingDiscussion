I&#39;m sure that <br/>\nmore moms would stay at home if they were given the respect they deserve. <br/>\nThere&#39;s kind of a stigma attached to being a &quot;housewife&quot;  Not to mention , <br/>\nhas anyone ever sat down what you would be owed if you were paid a salary? <br/>\nMy husband would go bankrupt paying me! Allthat laundry , food service, <br/>\nchildcare, yardwork, If you itemized everything and charged the going rate <br/>\nfor these services- can you imagine? tee hee.<br/>\n                                        Trisha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, Dia...   do you want a law preventing mothers of young children from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; working?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;No, I think the government is more than involved enough in our lives as it<br/>\n&gt;is.
