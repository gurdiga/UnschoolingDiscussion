Plus, things are so busy at the conference---early mornings <br/>\nand late nights and afternoon naps, maybe? &lt;g&gt; that you would probably <br/>\nfind that &quot;commuting&quot; is a pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might have some luck finding folks to say with while travelling <br/>\nthere and back to save on $$$.
