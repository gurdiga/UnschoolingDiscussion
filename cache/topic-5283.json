Also, people with lower <br/>\nself-esteem/confidence seem to have a better sense of smell.  I view certain <br/>\npeople in my life almost as vultures hovering around waiting for me to falter <br/>\n(well, that may be a bit extreme...) so they can swoop down and say, &quot;See?  I <br/>\ntold you so.&quot;  These are the people I need to avoid when I&#39;m feeling less <br/>\nthan confident myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOther people with an overly-developed sense of smell may not necessarily fit <br/>\nthe above category, but may just be fearful.  Grandparents, for instance, who <br/>\nI think feel a lack of control and worry more when something is away from the <br/>\nnorm.  Their intentions may be good, but they obviously can do more harm by <br/>\nhovering and hand-wringing.
