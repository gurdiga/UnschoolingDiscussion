Fournier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to see the film (at a pre-showing with my church) and was truly touched by it.<br/>\nIt is horrible, but, Christ was treated horribly.  Two thoughts to share:  All during<br/>\nthe movie, the scripture verse that kept running through my mind was &quot;By His stripes<br/>\nwe are healed&quot;......and as I watched the scourging, I understood so much better.  The<br/>\nother thought was that no human could have survived long enough to make it to the<br/>\ncross...but Christ was not wholly human, he was/is also wholly God, and had the inner<br/>\nstrength and love to make it all the way.  He willingly gave up his life for us!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust read this article, I think it will shed a lot of light on our questions....<br/>\n<br/>\nKarol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.christianity.com/partner/Article_Display_Page/0,,PTID5339|\">http://www.christianity.com/partner/Article_Display_Page/0,,PTID5339|</a>CHID14|CIID1615818,00.html</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91668,"nextTopicId":91689}}
