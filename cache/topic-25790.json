I made a mental note to play some colour games with him or <br/>\nsomething but never got around to it.  A couple of months later, I noticed <br/>\nthat he knew his colours.  &lt;g&gt;  Possibly I had started using colour names <br/>\naround him more, but I didn&#39;t do anything conscious.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was around 6 and learning to tell time, he told me that he knew <br/>\nwhat 12 +12 was.  I asked him how he knew that, and he told me that there <br/>\nare 24 hours in a day and the clock only has 12 hours.  So 12 + 12 must <br/>\nequal 24.  That&#39;s knowledge that he owns, because he ferreted it out himself.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I would love to hear anyone&#39;s personal unschooling stories.
