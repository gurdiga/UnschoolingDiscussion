Lately 5yob has been very<br/>\ninterested in learning to read so I have been<br/>\nproviding plenty of oppertunities for him to learn in<br/>\nthat area. But while he has been spending so much time<br/>\non reading I have been thinking in the back of my mind<br/>\nthat he needs to learn his numbers better. I hadn&#39;t<br/>\ndone anything with numbers because I wasn&#39;t sure how<br/>\nto make it fun and interesting for him. Well, tonight<br/>\nat dinner we started talking about shapes and looking<br/>\naround the room for different shapes. Then he started<br/>\nto count the rectangualar cabinet doors which lead to<br/>\nhim adding and subtracting them by opening and closing<br/>\nthem. Silly me. And I thought he needed to learn more<br/>\nabout his numbers and he has already figured out some<br/>\nsimple math without me.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
