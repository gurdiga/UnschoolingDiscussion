I&#39;ve been trying to be patient with my youngest son, Michael, who still isn&#39;t <br/>\nshowing much interest in reading at the grand old age of - brace yourselves, dear readers - 16 next week. No, that&#39;s not a slip of the<br/>\nkeys..........<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat exactly do you mean when you say your 16yo isn&#39;t reading. My 12yo doesn&#39;t show any interest in reading but he can do it. He&#39;s not very good at it, because he doesn&#39;t do it much, but again he can do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow with math this is different because it doesn&#39;t work the same way. Unless someone shows him the procedure he doesn&#39;t seem to create or find the knowledge naturally. Well I guess you might say that he does but it&#39;s soooo basic. He can use money alright but he&#39;s not totally competent that&#39;s for sure. He has to count on the cashier for the correct change.  He knows something of the value of things in dollars and cents and he knows something about measurement from cooking and building skateboard ramps etc... but he can&#39;t do math, like they teach in school, much at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t worry too much about language development because I intuitively understand the natural development of these skills . I don&#39;t have the same same confidence with math skills. My first was math wiz and he worked on Kumon math and kept a journal as his school/education routine. With my second two I&#39;ve been totally unschooling mostly because my middle son, the genius/weirdo of the family, totally resists lessons of any kind. He didn&#39;t really begin to read until he was 10, and he still isn&#39;t at all interested in it, past reading a menu or directions for a video game, and he has no interest in learning math procedures. He likes to play video games, skateboard, snowboard, watch skateboard videos, watch TV, play with friends and visit with relatives. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo you all wouldn&#39;t worry if you were me, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI do find myself feeling worried at times especially when there&#39;s a chance I might be asked to show an authority what he does and can do. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Helen Hegener <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, December 28, 2001 6:18 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Late Readers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;At 2:35 PM -0500 12/28/01, Joseph Fuerst wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;     I feel a &quot;spell&quot; coming on with being frustrated with 10yo dd&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt;inability to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  This kid lives to snowboard - and not much else.
