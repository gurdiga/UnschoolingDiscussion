I know for our family, we are neither seekers <br/>\n&gt; nor avoiders of specialized training and experience. It was a hard <br/>\n&gt; decision to make and we had to evaluate both the potential for good <br/>\n&gt; and the potential for harm in getting the &quot;experts&quot; involved in our <br/>\n&gt; child&#39;s life. Sharing the process and the outcome of our decision <br/>\n&gt; with other unschoolers who might have to face it seems like a helpful <br/>\n&gt; thing to me. I think it&#39;s very on-topic in discussions of unschooling <br/>\n&gt; as not just an educational decision, but a lifestyle.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>       I was responding, not saying myself, that the business about experts <br/>\nwasn&#39;t  about unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n       And I am right with you in the middle of that big middle, not on <br/>\neither extreme. I don&#39;t know about you guys but my parenting decisions are mostly <br/>\n*all* hard decisions, with potential for both good and for harm. And usually <br/>\nspecific to each situation, tough to generalize about and thankfully unnecessary <br/>\nto generalize about. That&#39;s why we avoid standardized things like school, and <br/>\nprize real, personal stories, right? :)  JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94474,"nextTopicId":94453}}
