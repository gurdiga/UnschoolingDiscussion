It isn&#39;t required in California, either, but <br/>\nonce you enroll in Kindergarten it IS required to attend or the child <br/>\nis truant and they have SPECIAL anti-truancy catch-them-early programs <br/>\naimed at kindergarten. If you miss too many days in k, they target you <br/>\nin first grade and they go after you very very quickly for truancy - <br/>\nstraight to the district attorney, not even through the normal school <br/>\nattendance review board channels. Only some districts participate in <br/>\nthis special program - but they are relentless. I know someone whose <br/>\nchild was seriously ill - chronically ill. She tried to send her to <br/>\nkindergarten, but had many bouts of lengthy absence due to <br/>\nhospitalizations. She also let her daughter not go when she didn&#39;t feel <br/>\nlike it because she never knew when she was getting sick or not. In <br/>\nfirst grade the first time her daughter was absent they sent a truancy <br/>\nreport to the district attorney who contacted her and said they were <br/>\ngoing to ask for a court order to require her to send her child to <br/>\nschool. They GOT it and the court ordered that even if her child was <br/>\nsick she had to take her in to be examined there at the school. The <br/>\nONLY exception was if she had chickenpox.  I met her at that time <br/>\nbecause she tried to pull her child all the way out of school and <br/>\nhomeschool her. But- once the court is involved they have so much <br/>\njurisdiction it is amazing - she had to get their permission otherwise <br/>\nshe&#39;d be in violation of the court order. So - be careful about <br/>\nassuming that just because kindergarten is not mandatory that you can <br/>\njust choose to go or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":171268986,"authorName":"Tracey Inman","from":"&quot;Tracey Inman&quot; &lt;traceyinman@...&gt;","profile":"tracey_inman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Intro Continued OOPS!

For example, Virginia homeschool law provides options and <br/>\ntesting is only one of them. If people want to unschool in some states, <br/>\nthey&#39;re going to have to be a little more clever, work a little harder <br/>\nto not get sucked into the requirements.

Just like in every other state, what <br/>\nis important is to get into contact with other unschoolers in that <br/>\nstate (or even in that district, if possible) and find out what they do <br/>\n- maybe they do independent assessments - maybe you can find an <br/>\nevaluator who is unschooling friendly. I&#39;m not sure that the evaluator <br/>\neven has to be in your state - I wonder if you could use Clonlara - <br/>\nthey are VERY unschooling friendly and may already have worked in your <br/>\nstate and have already prepared materials to satisfy the state <br/>\nstandards and still allow you to unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is really for talking about living an unschooling life - <br/>\ntalking about legal issues could take up ALL our time and we usually <br/>\ntry to move people away from that pretty quickly.

There are a number of folks from VA on this list, and several of<br/>\nthem have mentioned their unschooling friendly evaluators. &quot;Making you&quot; put<br/>\nyour child back in school against your will is a lot harder than &quot;they&quot;<br/>\nwould like you to believe, and takes years, not terms. BTW most of the<br/>\nstatutes talk about the child &quot;showing progress&quot; each year - how can a free,<br/>\nhappy child with engaged caring parents not show progress? It is not about<br/>\nre-creating the &quot;results&quot; of a school year since you are out of the bell<br/>\ncurve.<br/>\nThe more fear testing generates in you, the faster you should run to other<br/>\nmethods of review - so that the idea of tests does not become an all<br/>\npowerful boogeyman in the minds of your kids. I don&#39;t do too much school<br/>\nbashing (fish in a barrel), but there is a time and place for almost<br/>\neverything so here goes - Schools as an entity, have a vested interest in<br/>\nmaking that which is natural, simple and easy, seem difficult and<br/>\nnon-intuitive. Reading is the classic example of this concept. Tests are<br/>\nsupposed to be scary, important and full of dire consequences. Don&#39;t buy<br/>\ninto it. Tests can be a fun thing IF the motivations are internal and<br/>\nindividual. People choose to test themselves all the time - for REAL skills<br/>\nor abilities or learning opportunities. <br/>\nRobyn L.

The torture was in the little things (having to get up and <br/>\nget ready by a certain time, having to follow all the little inane <br/>\nrules that schools have, etc)...i&#39;d already stopped making him (or <br/>\neven reminding him!)to do homework. Now that my son is home...oh <br/>\nmy...life is great. It is an incredible weight lifted off of you and <br/>\nyour child when you realize &quot;We don&#39;t have to deal with it anymore!&quot; <br/>\nIMO finishing the next two or three months of kindergarten is not <br/>\nworth the impact on the family each day of going can cause, and in <br/>\nfive years you&#39;ll look back and wonder how you ever thought it <br/>\nmattered to &quot;finish out the school year.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI know sometimes its hard to leave things unfinished, esp when its so <br/>\nclose to &quot;being done&quot; (in my son&#39;s case he just never went back, and <br/>\ndidnt say goodbye to anyone at the school, or even get his <br/>\nstuff)....but i have to say that my only regret about pulling my son <br/>\nout of school is that i waited so long to do it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Intro Continued OOPS!

I am intrigued by the views and opinions <br/>\noffered here and I feel stronger in my decision to homeschool/unschool. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am the proud MaMa of Andrew, 6 and Mason, 2. These two amazing people <br/>\nchanged my life and that of my dh from long before their births. I knew from <br/>\nday <br/>\none that I wanted to stay home and homeschool. I lost my courage somewhere <br/>\nalong the line and I am not so proud to say that Andrew is in Kindergarten. <br/>\nWe <br/>\ndebated and debated and visited schools, private, church-based, etc. We <br/>\nfinally settled on a fundamental school, which I really haven&#39;t had any <br/>\n&quot;problems&quot; <br/>\nwith, other than the fact that I just know it&#39;s wrong. Which, I guess is a <br/>\nBIG problem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the response thus far and I totally agree.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have NO idea how this got sent when it was in my Mail Waiting To Be Sent <br/>\nfolder, but now that I am back on track, I&#39;d like to continue.  I am definitely <br/>\ngoing to submit my Notice of Intent for next year and I almost feel as if I <br/>\nshould do it now, but I feel that since we did it thus far, that we should <br/>\nfinish it.  We had always talked about homeschooling and Andrew has asked me <br/>\nseveral times throughout this year why we aren&#39;t doing it.  We tell him the truth, <br/>\nthat we were not sure if it was something we could do and hope that he was <br/>\nlearning all he should (is there even a &quot;should know&quot; stage?).  But I also asked <br/>\nhim if he wanted to keep going and he said yes and asked if it would be ok if <br/>\nhe stayed home some days when he didn&#39;t want to go, and of course this was <br/>\nanswered yes as well.  Well, this past Monday, a letter was sent home saying that <br/>\nAndrew had 5 excused absences but if it continues that we would have to get <br/>\ntogether to make a plan for better attendance.  I was upset because he was so <br/>\nupset.  He asked me to tell him what it was about and he was upset because he <br/>\nfelt they were mad at him.  I told him that they weren&#39;t but that schools just <br/>\nwant the kids to be there everyday, on time, blah blah blah.  He said, &quot;Well, <br/>\nwhen it&#39;s so nice out, I don&#39;t wanna go,&quot; and &quot;Mason gets lonely without me and <br/>\nI need to be here sometimes.&quot;  And the conversation went like that for a <br/>\nwhile.  What would others do?  I feel tied up about this.  He&#39;s there for 3 hours, <br/>\nonly 2 of which are probably even useful.  But when we made this decision we <br/>\nthought this was the best school if we&#39;re gonna do school at all, but didn&#39;t <br/>\nrealize that since it is so far away and we have to all get ready, this has put <br/>\nMason on a schedule and he ends up spending half the day getting ready to go <br/>\nand stuck in the van, and then ready to go again to pick Andrew up.  I just <br/>\ndon&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling was something I had heard of and the idea was and is exhilarating <br/>\nbut my state seems too strict, too much red tape, they require testing each <br/>\nyear.  I don&#39;t understand how the state can require testing each year but in <br/>\nschool they are only tested in certain grades.  I had read all the stuff on <br/>\nSandra&#39;s site about testing and so I looked up some resources to get tests and <br/>\ncame across an interesting thing.  The Seton site says you may not read the test <br/>\nto your child, that it should be completed with their knowledge only. WHAT!!!! <br/>\n How can a non-reading child take a test without help?  You are only supposed <br/>\nto show them the basics, like filling in all the little circles and then they <br/>\nare on their for each timed exercise.  Is there anyway around this?  Are <br/>\nthere any unschoolers in VA that have been down this road?  I am truely a newbie <br/>\nand I want so much to succeed in this, because I&#39;d like nothing more than to go <br/>\nback to life before Kindergarten and just let my children be kids and learn <br/>\ntheir own way in their own time, by their own means.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all your support thus far, the list is AMAZING!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPamela  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Intro Continued OOPS!
