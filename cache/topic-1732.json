Something that would be<br/>\noverwhelming in getting in the way with life in general would be an<br/>\naddiction. Something disruptive to the person themselves and the family. If<br/>\na child (or anyone) is eating and sleeping and still enjoying interaction<br/>\nwith love concerning family and friends, and still enjoying the other<br/>\ninterests they have had, or new ones, then I say that&#39;s focus and passion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Joseph has a YuGiOh passion. He talks a lot about the cards, the game,<br/>\nthe show and what he finds on websites. I try really hard not to let my eyes<br/>\nglaze over when he starts talking about it. &lt;BG&gt; But he still goes outside<br/>\nto play and swim. He still wants to have our craft day out every Wed. with<br/>\nfriends. He still eats and sleeps and watches other things on TV. He wants<br/>\nand enjoys our outtings with the family. He reads other books and does other<br/>\nthings on the computer besides YuGiOh. He&#39;s really looking forward to sports<br/>\ncamp starting again. The list goes on and on. Sometimes it seems like the<br/>\nwhole day was spent on watching, surfing and playing YuGiOh. But when I<br/>\nreally look at it, he certainly hasn&#39;t spent that entire day doing nothing<br/>\nbut that. To anyone else who isn&#39;t really looking, they would probably say<br/>\nhe&#39;s into it way too much.

I think this was what was really bothering me a few weeks ago when I was asking about my 14dd spending &#39;all&#39; of her time I-M ing her friends. I  knew then I wasn&#39;t really clear on what was bothering me, and didn&#39;t know how to express it. I was really worried that her behavior was &#39;addiction&#39; rather than an interest. I think I&#39;m relieved of that worry now, mostly. There is so much talk about addiction, nowadays. Does anyone have a really good definition? It may be helpful to those of us with &#39;focused&#39; kids. <br/>\nSandra&#39;s comment on riding the waves of your kids&#39; stages and moods was right on, and I loved hearing how she rode the bus standing up. We were never allowed to do that but on our curvy road it would have been really fun and challenging. It would have made PE superfluous!

But when you look at each <br/>\nchild individually, you&#39;ll see that they are spending time doing things that <br/>\nengage and interest them, and doing it in ways that work best for them.  That&#39;s <br/>\nwhat unschooling is all about.  Some kids bounce around from activity to <br/>\nanother constantly, and others immerse themselves in things until they&#39;ve exhausted <br/>\nthe possibilities for learning.   Some do both at different times.  It&#39;s all <br/>\ngood.  ;-) <br/>\n<br/>\nI know it is hard to accept this when it seems so extreme.  But maybe it will <br/>\nhelp to think of it this way.  When my husband was a kid, after his Dad <br/>\nupgraded his computer and gave him his old one, he spent *every waking moment* on <br/>\nthe computer.  (It&#39;s how I met him, in a roundabout way.)  To the exclusion of <br/>\nhis homework, hehehe, btw.  And it was mostly games, and bulletin boards, <br/>\nnothing that *looks* very valuable.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  He now makes a good living as a network administrator, no college degree.  <br/>\nHe does what he loves AND what he is good at.   He can do whatever his boss <br/>\nneeds him to do with one hand tied behind his back, and he has job security <br/>\ncause most of the yokems who take computer classes these days have no talent, <br/>\nimagination or real skills, just knowledge, which is NOT the same thing.  He <br/>\nreplaced and fixed the mistakes of a yokem like that, hehehe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHis *unschooling* was much more valuble than his formal education (private <br/>\nschools).  It&#39;s one of the reasons why we unschool.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank goodness his Mom didn&#39;t worry about how much time he spent on the <br/>\ncomputer, right?!!  lol<br/>\n<br/>\n~Aimee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Newbie","postDate":"1061750137","msgId":79158,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzUwMWMzNmE2ZSQ4Mzc1ZmI0MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDMwODI0MTIyNTAyLjIyNTAxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxNjAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":79154,"nextInTopic":79161,"prevInTime":79157,"nextInTime":79159,"topicId":1732,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" He does have other interests, like Scouts, and he attends regularly.

Looking at a<br/>\nchild as if he is flawed won&#39;t help him become confident.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our society when adults become highly specialized in their fields we<br/>\nadmire their dedication and singlemindedness.  We rely on specialists<br/>\nwhen we need cabinets built, plumbing work, surgery, etc.  <br/>\nHave you ever thought a brain surgeon might be addicted to brains?   A<br/>\nplumber addicted to pipes? (yes, I thought about saying &quot;poop&quot;, but I<br/>\nresisted.)  <br/>\nThere are some hotshot young&#39;uns out there designing computer software<br/>\nthese days and making a bazillion dollars.      <br/>\n<br/>\n***He is the same type of kid who would eat the whole shopping bag of<br/>\ncandy. He doesn&#39;t know when to stop***<br/>\n<br/>\nHe does know when to stop, it&#39;s just that he&#39;s not stopping when *you*<br/>\nbelieve he should.&lt;g&gt;    Stopping when one is finished or has had enough<br/>\nis a good reason to stop.   Stopping because someone else says you&#39;re<br/>\nfinished is not a personally fulfilling experience.  It&#39;s frustrating.   <br/>\nPeople need time to experiment, time to become absorbed and make<br/>\ndiscoveries about themselves and what they need.  He&#39;ll come to his own<br/>\nwise conclusions if given the opportunity.   <br/>\n<br/>\nYour son simply needs more time at the computer in order to absorb<br/>\neverything he wants to. <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning about ourselves can be the hardest thing of all.  Lots of young<br/>\npeople come from homes where they lived under their parents limits and<br/>\nwhen they are out on their own they go about discovering their own<br/>\npersonal limits.   I really believe it&#39;s safer and better for young kids<br/>\nto make their discoveries at home, to gain a lot of experience making<br/>\ndecisions, so when they&#39;re out on their own, they can go about life<br/>\nalready knowing how to live it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***My husband has a similar personality.  Drinks too much coffee and<br/>\ncoke...has tried to quit smoking more times than I care to count.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it possible your husband simply requires, desires,  more coffee, or<br/>\ncoke than you, for whatever reason, and that you wish your own personal<br/>\nlimits were also his?   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband requires more sleep than I do.  I feel best on four hours.  He<br/>\ncan go ten or twelve (when he doesn&#39;t have to get up for work).   I think<br/>\nstaying in bed that long is a huge waste of time.   I wouldn&#39;t want him<br/>\ndeciding I needed more sleep.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ***He says he knows he is on it too much, but he loves it.  He has tried<br/>\nto set the timer to limit his time, but he doesn&#39;t do this consistently. <br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nI think he&#39;s probably saying what he thinks will soothe you a little. <br/>\nThe reason he doesn&#39;t set a timer is because a timer can&#39;t know when he&#39;s<br/>\nfinished!    A timer is an arbitrary thing.  <br/>\nWould you want him to set a timer if he was mowing the lawn for you?  <br/>\nWould you only want him to mow until the timer rang, or would it be more<br/>\nsatisfying if the lawn was finished?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***I don&#39;t want this to be a power struggle,***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can only be a power struggle when parents want the power to decide<br/>\nwhen their children have had enough personal fulfillment. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n***I will tell him to get off the computer and the next thing I notice is<br/>\nhe is glued to a western on TV or Game Boy.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to make a value judgement about television and Gameboy without<br/>\nit becoming a value judgement about the kind of person who would enjoy<br/>\nthose things.   <br/>\nAnd if he turns to them because the thing he was truly interested in has<br/>\nbeen taken away nothing has been accomplished.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there many things he does that don&#39;t seem worthwhile to you?<br/>\nMaybe looking at all his good qualities and looking  more closely at the<br/>\none&#39;s you think aren&#39;t so good would help.   In your own mind maybe<br/>\n&quot;addiction&quot;  can become involvement, engagement, dedication, persistence,<br/>\ndrive, ambition. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs there something you really love to do, something that engages you?  <br/>\nDo you garden, or build race cars?<br/>\nCan someone else decide for you when you&#39;ve had enough of those things?  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nHow would you feel about your husband if he looked at your choice to<br/>\ngarden as if it was a problem and you were somehow faulty for wanting to<br/>\ndo it?

My daughter is not attracted to either medium. Oh, she watches a show here and there on Animal Planet, and she has a computer program or two that she likes, but for the most part, life beckons her.  She likes to be off doing, playing, creating, interacting with people, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy son, who has been in the same relaxed schooling atmosphere that she has, chooses computer.  He can spend literally hours and hours, which turn into days and days, at the computer.  This doesn&#39;t seem healthy to me on so many levels.  It is like the computer is addictive for him.  He is the same type of kid who would eat the whole shopping bag of candy.  He doesn&#39;t know when to stop.  My husband has a similar personality.  Drinks too much coffee and coke...has tried to quit smoking more times than I care to count.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband thinks computer time should be limited...but I wondered how experienced unschoolers deal with the whole issue.  I have tried to get my son to talk about the whole computer issue.  He says he knows he is on it too much, but he loves it.  He has tried to set the timer to limit his time, but he doesn&#39;t do this consistently.  Sometimes it seems that he needs his &quot;fix&quot; and purposely doesn&#39;t set the timer.  I don&#39;t want this to be a power struggle, but I also don&#39;t like seeing him sit glued to the computer screen.  Sometimes I will tell him to get off the computer and the next thing I notice is he is glued to a western on TV or Game Boy.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI remember watching an old Star Trek episode once where everyone was glued to some video game. This was before the video game craze hit.  My son reminds me of that episode.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe does have other interests, like Scouts, and he attends regularly. It&#39;s not like he gives up Scouts for the computer.  But the minute he comes home that computer is back on.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks for your help,<br/>\nDeana<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
