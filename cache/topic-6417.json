I&#39;ve decided to delurk after about a week or so.  My<br/>\n&gt; question is regarding use of computers.  My husband thinks that our<br/>\n&gt; children (age 4 and 2) should not ever use the computer.  I think that<br/>\n&gt; the computer could be an invaluable tool.  I have offered to buy them<br/>\n&gt; their own keyboard, so they won&#39;t gum ours up or anything (although if<br/>\n&gt; you make rules, that shouldn&#39;t happen anyway!).  He says I&#39;d have to buy<br/>\n&gt; them their own computer because he doesn&#39;t want them getting into the<br/>\n&gt; wrong files and messing our stuff up.  He won&#39;t even let them use it with<br/>\n&gt; me sitting right beside them.<br/>\n&gt; What does everyone else feel about kids and the use of computers?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -jessica<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pages.ivillage.com/pp/jessilfp\">http://pages.ivillage.com/pp/jessilfp</a><br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; YOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\n&gt; Juno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\n&gt; Try it today - there&#39;s no risk!

In other words, one hour of either computer, nintendo, TV, or gameboy per day.  My son has free access to all of these things.  My son&#39;s friend NEVER wants to be at home....always wants to come over here....and he marvels at how much &quot;fun&quot; we all seem to have together. <br/>\n<br/>\n His dad wants him to be a doctor.....his dad IS a doctor (so is my husband), though we have always led both of our boys to think about finding their passion and then try to find work that fits it.  Anyway, my son&#39;s friend called up yesterday to ask my son to ask his older brother how much money a computer programmer makes.  Seems that his friend is trying to convince his dad that being a computer programmer can bring in as much money as being a doctor!!  This had my whole family in a discussion of how so many kids are being led to believe that the way to be happy is to make six figures!!  Forget about what brings you joy, just look at the money.  How sad is this? <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my point is......this kid has been kept from doing the one thing that he enjoys most.....playing with technology.  It&#39;s become the forbidden fruit, and is now causing a 13yo boy to have to petition his dad to &quot;let&quot; him take on a certain profession one day.  It&#39;s all he dreaming of......being allowed at a keyboard as much as he wants.  How will he ever know what it is he really wants with that kind of control over him?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids&#39; generation will be surrounded by technology, and computers will be running the show, whether we like it or not.  To not allow kids to become computer savvy, to me, will be putting them at an extreme disadvantage in the world.

We have 2 computers and they use both, but mainly stick to the one that has all their software installed.  The kids know how to put in their own CD roms etc.  I know it&#39;s not economically feasible for most families to have two computers, we happen to have a newly blended family and we both had computers when we got married.  The kids know how to put in their own CD roms etc.  The 13 yo probably knows more about computers than I do.  You might mention to your husband that it is possible to set up separate desktops with passwords, so they can&#39;t access your desktop.  You could make either of the desktops the default desktop.  I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible for them to get into your stuff, but they would have to know how to right click and explore the different drives - possible, but not likely.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Also, the children&#39;s section in our library has computers for them to use - maybe yours does too.  Let them learn how to use the computer properly there and maybe your husband will be so impressed he will let them use the home computer.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Hope I Helped!
