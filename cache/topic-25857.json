Wow....<br/>\n<br/>\nIt strikes me that it must be VERY hard to live in the world if you have <br/>\nbelieve that Satan is around every corner ready to destroy you and your <br/>\nchildren--even those that allegedly have the same beliefs as you!<br/>\n<br/>\nA woman on another list I know said that she tells her children (3 and 5) <br/>\nthat if they don&#39;t explicitly follow the Bible that they will go to hell, and <br/>\nthat she would never see them again because she will be with God in heaven. <br/>\nAnd God wouldn&#39;t want her to be sad that her children were in hell, so he&#39;d <br/>\ntake away all her memories of them, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone here seen the movie Dogma? I keep thinking about the Apostle who <br/>\nsaid it was better to have an idea than a belief.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo any Christians on the list--PLEASE understand that I do not intend this to <br/>\nbe offensive. I have read the Bible and I personally do not believe it <br/>\nsupports these kinds of ideas. Nowhere in the Bible is the Illuminati <br/>\nmentioned, nor threatening your children. Jesus is supposed to be about love <br/>\nand peace. I worry what&#39;s being done in his name.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25907,"nextTopicId":25905}}
