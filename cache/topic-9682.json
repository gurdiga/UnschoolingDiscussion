Don&#39;t give up hope of him making more money.  When Steve started <br/>\nout in the industry 4 years ago and knew nothing he earned $10 per hour.  <br/>\nAfter 9 months he took at job that paid $12.  He then took at regular job <br/>\npaying $26,000 per year.  8 months after that he took a job paying $32,000.  <br/>\n1 year after that he took a job paying $42,000.  3 months ago he took a job <br/>\npaying $55,000 and people say the Computer Industry doesn&#39;t pay in Tucson.  <br/>\nAll through this my husband self studied and went to the University of <br/>\nPhoenix one night a week. He took every MCSE and CNE test.  He&#39;s now a <br/>\nNetwork Manager.  The next move will be IT Director or out of State to <br/>\npossibly Washington for better weather and a better way of life.  The good <br/>\nthing about computers is that you keep moving up and no one seems to care <br/>\nwhether   you&#39;ve been somewhere for only 1 year or not.  It seems to be <br/>\nexpected.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about what you can do at home and turn it into a business.  If you want <br/>\nto e-mail me privately I&#39;ll be more than happy to help you with this as <br/>\nthat&#39;s what I do for a living.  Help people figure out what they want to do <br/>\nand then show them the resources to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9606,"nextTopicId":9685}}
