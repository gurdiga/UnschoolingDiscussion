I think some *foods* are <br/>\nbetter than others. I think *feeling* healthy is better than not <br/>\nfeeling healthy. I think having a body that can do what you want it <br/>\nto is better than having a body that&#39;s limited (and having broken 13 <br/>\nbones in this life, I know what the limits feel like when they&#39;re <br/>\nthere!). But I don&#39;t judge people, friends or otherwise, on whether <br/>\nthey&#39;re healthy. I don&#39;t feel that they&#39;re a better *person* if <br/>\nthey&#39;re healthy. I want my kids to be healthy because I think they&#39;ll <br/>\nhave a greater quality of life for whatever time they&#39;re given to be <br/>\non earth. I don&#39;t want them to be healthy because I think that <br/>\nsomehow that would make them a superior person to those around them. <br/>\nHopefully that&#39;s a better definition of what I meant in the quote <br/>\nabove.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Don&#39;t back down when you think you&#39;re right!

I&#39;m rather known <br/>\nfor stating my mind :-) I *do* believe it is better, for our family <br/>\nand for our kids, for us to be healthy. I don&#39;t try to tell others <br/>\nthat they&#39;re a bad person because they had a moonpie and cola for <br/>\nbreakfast. I might think that they&#39;re not a particularly *healthy* <br/>\nperson if that&#39;s their regular daily breakfast fare, but that doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean I think that they&#39;re a *bad* person or someone I wouldn&#39;t want <br/>\nto be around. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy whole statement about most people not being healthy was not meant <br/>\nto be derogatory, just a statement of fact.

But I think healthy encompasses mental health, <br/>\nspiritual health, more than just bodily health. If a person is truly <br/>\nhealthy - mind, body, spirit - then they are usually a joy to be <br/>\naround. And there are plenty of people on the whole spectrum of <br/>\nhealth to non-health who are fun to hang out with. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a value judgement or a statement of character to say someone <br/>\nis healthy or not healthy, or for a person to feel that way about <br/>\nthemself. One of my good friends about 15 years ago was a guy who <br/>\nweighed 400 pounds and could hardly walk around. Then he lost 190 <br/>\npounds and became this super-athletic kind of guy. Then he gained <br/>\nabout 50 pounds back and became a semi-athletic, semi-couch potato <br/>\nkind of guy. But he was always the same guy - always funny, always <br/>\nkind, always interesting.

I <br/>\nfeel grateful that my parents gave me the gift of good health - <br/>\nthrough the foods that we, as a family, ate, through our activity <br/>\nlevel, through our friendships, groups, etc. through our <br/>\nappreciation and enjoyment of nature and being outdoors. My mom even <br/>\nbreastfed me for a year in an era when that was darn near not done, <br/>\nand I feel that was a gift too.

But that doesn&#39;t mean that when you walk <br/>\ninto a WalMart in the middle of America you are going to see the same <br/>\nkind of thing.

I <br/>\nalso want them to be able to depend on their own bodies for <br/>\ntransportation, and all sorts of other physical tasks.

I meet people <br/>\nin their 50s, 60s, 70s, and beyond who are still doing amazing things <br/>\nand it inspires me to feel like that is a possibility in our futures <br/>\nas well. So, when I consider what food to buy for our family, and <br/>\nwhat goes into my kids&#39; bodies, my definition of healthy is important <br/>\nto that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] healthy","postDate":"1034975015","msgId":46810,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5RDYzRkVDLjE0RjAlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMzQ5NTkwNzMuNDUzNy4xODYxMi5tMTBAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46841,"prevInTime":46809,"nextInTime":46811,"topicId":46810,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
