And I look at it like <br/>\nthis. <br/>\nMy children are learning to read, compute, write due to their efforts n <br/>\nrather than mine, with my help as they request it. I apply that learning <br/>\nprincipal to other areas such as what they wear, when they go to sleep, yadda <br/>\nyadda yadda. So it applies to learning to be neat and clean. <br/>\nSo what do I do? Stop asking, make cleaning look like just another thing that <br/>\ngets done in the day to day living, rather than the big deal I make it out to <br/>\nbe, encourage them to join in on the &quot;fun&quot; jobs, (windexing, dusting, cooking <br/>\nor whatever) accept that my priority to clean is not their priority, and do <br/>\nit myself.<br/>\nUnfortunately at this stage (as I realized yesterday) I have been slipping <br/>\nback and forth between trusting them to learn in their own time and way and <br/>\ngetting pissed off and yelling every other week or so about the condition of <br/>\nthe house and trying to make them fell guilty about not helping me. Yesterday <br/>\nI understood that I was paralleling () learning to unschool. I lay off them <br/>\nfor a while, things start to calm down, I SLACK OFF MY CLEANING and BAM! the <br/>\nhouse is a mess *I* am overwhelmed and the kids are getting yelled at. NOT <br/>\nworking.<br/>\nSo what have I decided to do about that? Well, some standards have to relax <br/>\nfirst off. Second, I talked to Joe about the situation and told him WHY I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to make the kids help, that then when given the CHOICE to help, <br/>\nthey will choose no, and third, If this is something that is important to me, <br/>\nI&#39;ll treat it as such. LIke a hobby. I&#39;ve started to reread &quot;The Messies <br/>\nManual&quot; and will go back on Fly Lady. I&#39;m going to take baby steps and do <br/>\nwhat I WANT to do and not worry about the rest. When I had that attitude <br/>\nbefore, that my priorities are mine and not anyone else&#39;s, I was HAPPY to do <br/>\nthe cleaning. I enjoyed it, and loved to get up and make a cup of tea from my <br/>\nclean teakettle, in a mug that was in the cabinet and washed.<br/>\nNow, I&#39;m not advocating all the above to everyone, some people couldn&#39;t care <br/>\nless! I feel this to be a priority because when MY house is cluttered and <br/>\nmessy and nothing can be found, it (the disorganization and clutter) seems to <br/>\nworm it&#39;s way into my mind. I get disorganized in my thoughts, and if other <br/>\nconditions are right, It leads to a horrible period of depression. So I need <br/>\nto take care of myself, And keeping my house clean myself, rather than <br/>\nwaiting for others to pitch in, is one very important way for me to take care <br/>\nof myself.<br/>\nWhew, so many words for 7:15 am!<br/>\n*~*Elissa Jill*~*<br/>\nUnschooling Momma to 3 beautiful brilliant people<br/>\nLoving partner for life to Joey<br/>\nterrible guitarist, fair singer and happy woman.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

It&#39;s a different goal. They currently don&#39;t want <br/>\nto. So what <br/>\ndo I do?<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if there isn&#39;t a difference between &quot;wanting to&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;being willing to.&quot; This is how I see it in our home. None of us <br/>\nreally wants to clean the bathrooms. I don&#39;t get a high off of <br/>\ncleaning (some women do). But it needs to be done. We&#39;ve <br/>\ndiscussed how to get it done. Lots of input from this <br/>\ndemocratically run household.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome weekends it isn&#39;t feasible for some reason (a child stayed <br/>\nup too late at a friend&#39;s, we have a basketball game, there&#39;s a <br/>\nspecial program on TV) so the scheduled time to do it is altered, <br/>\nor a kid swaps with someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we aren&#39;t asking if someone &quot;wants to clean,&quot; we are <br/>\ncreating a routine that includes cleaning and are allowing for the <br/>\nvariances that go with living our lives. Everyone who participates <br/>\nbenefits and we&#39;ve sold our kids on this idea simply by having <br/>\nthe calm discussion and explanation of what will happen in this <br/>\nhouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like what I&#39;m hearing here is that everything needs to be <br/>\noffered as optional. That seems to take the ideas beyond what <br/>\nthey are meant to achieve. The goal is to have children who can <br/>\nhonestly lead their lives from a position of power, internal <br/>\ncongruence and healthy participation in life. They don&#39;t have to <br/>\nalways ask themselves if what they are about to do is <br/>\npleasurable (which is what &quot;want to&quot; sounds like in my ears).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I don&#39;t see kids work as &quot;help.&quot; I never ask for help in that <br/>\nsense. I say, &quot;Hey you left the milk and cereal out. It needs to be <br/>\nput away.&quot; There is no request. No option. Just the calm <br/>\ndescription of reality and I fully expect that the child will hop up <br/>\nand take care of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would I ask whether he wanted to or not? I don&#39;t understand <br/>\nthis and I&#39;m not trying to be dense. And I don&#39;t think I am creating <br/>\ngood results with a damaging philosophy. In fact, I feel I&#39;m <br/>\nteaching my kids how to choose to participate in the running of a <br/>\nhousehold for the sake of others whether it pleases them in the <br/>\nmoment or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone is flat out unhappy with his or her task, feels <br/>\noverwhelmed with life, has a reason for not picking up after <br/>\nlunch...

And I look at it like <br/>\nthis. <br/>\nMy children are learning to read, compute, write due to their efforts n <br/>\nrather than mine, with my help as they request it. I apply that learning <br/>\nprincipal to other areas such as what they wear, when they go to sleep, yadda <br/>\nyadda yadda. So it applies to learning to be neat and clean. <br/>\nSo what do I do? Stop asking, make cleaning look like just another thing that <br/>\ngets done in the day to day living, rather than the big deal I make it out to <br/>\nbe, encourage them to join in on the &quot;fun&quot; jobs, (windexing, dusting, cooking <br/>\nor whatever) accept that my priority to clean is not their priority, and do <br/>\nit myself.<br/>\nUnfortunately at this stage (as I realized yesterday) I have been slipping <br/>\nback and forth between trusting them to learn in their own time and way and <br/>\ngetting pissed off and yelling every other week or so about the condition of <br/>\nthe house and trying to make them fell guilty about not helping me. Yesterday <br/>\nI understood that I was paralleling () learning to unschool. I lay off them <br/>\nfor a while, things start to calm down, I SLACK OFF MY CLEANING and BAM! the <br/>\nhouse is a mess *I* am overwhelmed and the kids are getting yelled at. NOT <br/>\nworking.<br/>\nSo what have I decided to do about that? Well, some standards have to relax <br/>\nfirst off. Second, I talked to Joe about the situation and told him WHY I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to make the kids help, that then when given the CHOICE to help, <br/>\nthey will choose no, and third, If this is something that is important to me, <br/>\nI&#39;ll treat it as such. LIke a hobby. I&#39;ve started to reread &quot;The Messies <br/>\nManual&quot; and will go back on Fly Lady. I&#39;m going to take baby steps and do <br/>\nwhat I WANT to do and not worry about the rest. When I had that attitude <br/>\nbefore, that my priorities are mine and not anyone else&#39;s, I was HAPPY to do <br/>\nthe cleaning. I enjoyed it, and loved to get up and make a cup of tea from my <br/>\nclean teakettle, in a mug that was in the cabinet and washed.<br/>\nNow, I&#39;m not advocating all the above to everyone, some people couldn&#39;t care <br/>\nless! I feel this to be a priority because when MY house is cluttered and <br/>\nmessy and nothing can be found, it (the disorganization and clutter) seems to <br/>\nworm it&#39;s way into my mind. I get disorganized in my thoughts, and if other <br/>\nconditions are right, It leads to a horrible period of depression. So I need <br/>\nto take care of myself, And keeping my house clean myself, rather than <br/>\nwaiting for others to pitch in, is one very important way for me to take care <br/>\nof myself.<br/>\nWhew, so many words for 7:15 am!<br/>\n*~*Elissa Jill*~*<br/>\nUnschooling Momma to 3 beautiful brilliant people<br/>\nLoving partner for life to Joey<br/>\nterrible guitarist, fair singer and happy woman.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] More about family life","postDate":"1042093588","msgId":53957,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNDJEMkE5LjFBQTElYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNDIwNzU1MDguMTUwOC45NzQ0Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":53950,"nextInTopic":53967,"prevInTime":53956,"nextInTime":53958,"topicId":53904,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

( as far as housekeeping, <br/>\nlaundry, cooking, yardwork, etc)   I know that most folks here dont agree <br/>\nwith parents asking thier kids to pitch in.. but, so far, I havent really <br/>\ncome up with an alternative.   I have been trying though.. trying to see <br/>\nother ways to survive as a family without depending on assistance from the <br/>\nkids.  I have never, ever been hard lined about chores or duties or jobs or <br/>\nthe like.  But, generally speaking, I would ask the kids to pick up after <br/>\nthemselves, take thier dirty dishes to the kitchen, put thier things away. . <br/>\nhelp carry in groceries, help with supper.. etc.. I dont have any &quot;rules&quot; <br/>\nabout thier rooms or beds.. Anna cleans her room when it gets too messy for <br/>\nher likeing ( which is not too messy)  Landon keeps his room clean, but he <br/>\ndidnt til he was about 13.. til then it was atrocious.  The younger boys, 11 <br/>\nand 7, thier room is still atrocious.  I mean, cant walk, food spilled, <br/>\nclothes out, call the health dept atrocious.   Its no use to ask them to <br/>\nclean it up.. They cant, it gets so bad that it is beyond thier capablities.. <br/>\n Then, they have no where to play, so they spill out into the living room and <br/>\nother rooms ( that is where my asking them to pick up comes in, when it <br/>\ninfringes on the &quot;common rooms&quot; we all use)  Dh and I cleaned it up after <br/>\nChristmas just so they would have a place to put thier new stuff.  Well, <br/>\nguess what, its trashed again.  I would use gentle reminders before it got <br/>\nout of hand.. Hey guys, maybe you should pick up your stuff , theres not too <br/>\nmuch to do.  I even picked it up a few times.. But, it never fails, it gets <br/>\nBEYOND bad.  Anyway, enough of my dirty room troubles.  I guess what I am <br/>\nsaying is, I can empathize.. and I hope that in time I can begin to <br/>\nunderstand how to manage my household without &quot;coercing&quot; my children into <br/>\nhelping me.  If I spend all of my time picking up after them, cleaning up, <br/>\ndoing ALL the work around here, then how will we have time to do anything <br/>\nfun?  And if I just leave the mess and let it all go, then we will become the <br/>\ntype of family that others have talked about the.. &quot;unclean, unhealthy, <br/>\nunfit&quot; stereotype.

Some of it makes me uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have routines in place that help the household run, but I am <br/>\na fairly random personality so they are definitely not rigid. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I&#39;ve seen it is that we all make a mess together living in <br/>\nthis house so we should all cooperate in cleaning it up. With <br/>\nseven of us, that works better on a routine with everyone giving <br/>\neffort. We have a weekly clean-up on Sat. mornings and the kids <br/>\ndo all the dishes and table stuff every night. Rooms are all <br/>\ncleaned every week and all kids do their own laundry starting at <br/>\nage 6. Everyone works on the yard--mowing, raking, snow <br/>\nshoveling. No one is exempt. And we do it together.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is incredibly liberating to me and to us as a family. No one <br/>\nfeels put upon and there is an esprit de corps that is very healthy. <br/>\nI love listening to the kids talk to each other at night while they <br/>\nclean up. They turn up their music and laugh and chat. it&#39;s such a <br/>\nneat time! I imagine they will remember it fondly when they are <br/>\nolder. But now, they would of course say no if I offered them a <br/>\nchoice between cleaning plates and playing X Box.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I think of unschooling and NCP, I think of creating a context <br/>\nfor maximum freedom to create... freedom to, rather than <br/>\nfreedom from. In our home, that will mean that we&#39;ll continue <br/>\nthese routines as they are. (We&#39;ve given them the freedom to <br/>\nmodify how the turns get set up and who does waht jobs... they <br/>\nare very democratic about it, actually.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess telling them to come downstairs dressed, with beds <br/>\nmade and to eat breakfast before moving on with the day didn&#39;t <br/>\nseem coercive to me.
