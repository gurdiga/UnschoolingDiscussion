It works wonderfully well.   It makes a <br/>\ndirect color copy as beautifully as could be.   It will run really thin paper, <br/>\nthick paper...     It was a good idea for them to practically give it to me, <br/>\nbecause the ink cartridges cost a fortune. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf gaming systems hardly pay for the development and manufacturing and <br/>\npackaging and shipping, no problem for the company.   The kids will buy controllers <br/>\nand games, and in the case of XBox--XBox live is $50 per year per kid.   WELL <br/>\nworth it, my kids&#39; opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;ve whimpered about the cost of four ink cartridges, Keith reminds me <br/>\nof the laser printer we bought 15 years ago that itself cost over $1000 and <br/>\neach cartridge (black only--no color) was $90.   Then I remember this one&#39;s very, <br/>\nvery cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"X-box 360","postDate":"1132888826","msgId":110175,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRtNXZ0cSs0aWJsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":110177,"prevInTime":110174,"nextInTime":110176,"topicId":110175,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Trevor, who keeps up on the industry quite well, says that Microsoft was rushed to get their new system out ahead of the PS3.
