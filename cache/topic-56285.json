Probably the most definitive study of *Sunday* is by the <br/>\nGerman scholar Willy Rordorf, in English translation as *Sunday: The History <br/>\nof the Day of Rest and Worship in the Earliest Centuries of the Christian <br/>\nChurch* (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1968).  The early Christians <br/>\ngathered for worship on the first day of the week in honor of the <br/>\nresurrection of Christ.  They struggled with the commandment about observing <br/>\nthe sabbath, and some early Christians observed both the Sabbath and the <br/>\nLord&#39;s Day (especially in Eygpt).  But by and large they believed that the <br/>\nnew reality of Christ superceded or fulfilled the Law of Moses, at least in <br/>\nits ritual aspects. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the Rordorf book is unaccessible you might want to check out the <br/>\nmulti-authored book, *The Study of Liturgy* edited by Cheslyn Jones, Geoffrey <br/>\nWainwright, and Edward Yarnold (Oxford University Press).  It was issed <br/>\nrecenly in a new edition and  can often be found on the shelves at Borders or <br/>\nBarnes and Noble.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\nFrank, of Frank and Mary!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51204,"nextTopicId":56228}}
