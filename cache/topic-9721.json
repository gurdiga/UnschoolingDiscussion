She  has <br/>\nworked for so long now, that it&#39;s like she can&#39;t change that part of her <br/>\nlife, in her perspective.  To her, they need her income.  Some people are not <br/>\nwilling to pare down their lifestyles, in order for a parent to be home more <br/>\nwith children, and she is an example of this.  A few years ago she inherited <br/>\n$100,000.  They could have made it work where one parent could have been home <br/>\nmore-- one of the parents could have at least opted to work part time.  But, <br/>\nthey spent most of the money, and refinanced their home for a lower payment, <br/>\nwhen they could have paid it off or almost paid it off.  They are just into a <br/>\nlot of materialism, and  are somewhat competitive about having and doing <br/>\nthings.  I think she did not have a lot materialistically  as a child, so it <br/>\nseems important to her and her dh, to have as much as they can now.
