That was when <br/>\nLenelle was about 4 and I who had been to school and only met one <br/>\nvery regimented and seperatist family of homeschoolers ever in my <br/>\nlife still equated school with education. (Even that statement <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make sense as I write it since the 6 girls I remeber seemed <br/>\nas educated as any of my school peers the years that I had them as <br/>\nneighbors)<br/>\n<br/>\nIronically never sending my daughter to school, organizing our life <br/>\ninto a type of school or joining a charter, but simply embracing life <br/>\nand motherhood while watching my child grow and learn by leaps and <br/>\nbounds finally it seems is revealing, the term unschooler has always <br/>\nfit our life.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one I had ever known had ever breast fed around me but I had <br/>\nalways wanted to nurse rather than bottle feed so I began looking <br/>\ninto it while I was pregnant and was enveloped into the world of <br/>\nlactation moms and babies who it turned out in our case were also <br/>\nlargely homeschooling families as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original breastfeeding ads I thought were right on target using <br/>\nshock and humor to shake people up abit and inform them. It would <br/>\nhave been different if they used real pregnant women but they knew <br/>\nbetter. <br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;KathysTMPJ@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was just wondering if anyone happened to catch the episode of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>20/20 <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; on Friday that had a segment about the new commercials for the <br/>\n&gt; breastfeeding awareness campaign being &quot;edited&quot; because of the <br/>\n&gt; formula companies (and their big bucks).
