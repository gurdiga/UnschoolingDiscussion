The poster stated that more was going on with her<br/>\nson than &quot;ADHD&quot;, such as hallucinating, and yes, they can most assuredly<br/>\ntake your son away for not medicating a serious disorder.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way you get around that is to find a naturopath or some type of<br/>\nhomeopath that has credentials and is willing to back your decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have spent years working with Child Protective Services as a foster parent<br/>\nand as a therapist.  If most people knew the power this agency has, it would<br/>\nscare them to death.  At least in Texas, a caseworker can take walk into<br/>\nyour home and take your child today.  Within 2 days, she has to be able to<br/>\nprove to a judge that you are not acting in the child&#39;s best interests.  If<br/>\nshe can&#39;t make the case, the child is simply returned home but she is in no<br/>\nway punished.  She has to prove nothing to take your child away in the first<br/>\nplace, doesn&#39;t need a warrant or anything.  I had a foster child once for<br/>\nover 4 months because the caseworker got mad that the mom moved from a<br/>\nshelter where some of the kids were being abused by older kids into her own<br/>\nhome.  Took the mom 4 months and lots of lawyers to get her back.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie--who isn&#39;t scared of the devil himself but shivers at the thought of<br/>\ncaseworkers</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44459,"nextTopicId":44463}}
