I am also known as Xena in a few groups.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhere do I begin?  I am in my forties, and I have four daughters, only one who is not grown and out on her own.  My youngest daughter is six, almost seven years old.  Her father (step-father, actually, but only father she has every known, as her bio-dad ran off before she was born)  and I have decided not to send her to public school, for various reasons.  He is Australian, I am American, and we travel alot.  We value our freedom to move around as we please, although, at the moment, due to my husband&#39;s work commitments (software engineer/senior systems analyst), we are in a &quot;stand still&quot; position for the present.  Our daughter is a &quot;people person&quot;, very sociable, as am I, while her father is more introverted, very much a loner type.  They clash alot in this area, and I sometimes wonder if we&#39;re doing the right thing in regard to schooling, as our daughter is very very lonely.  She craves to have friends, and we are not in a living area where it is possible to make lasting friendships without going to school, if this makes sense.  The rest of the family lives three hours&#39; drive away, so we see them about once a month. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have any ideas for giving her social experiences while still continuing to educate at home?  I am learning alot from your group.  You have many diverse opinions here, eye-opening concepts, open intelligent discussions, which makes this a VERY interesting support group.  I&#39;m open-minded to learning other ways of dealing with education rather than the mainstream way.  My life concepts and the public education concept have clashed many times, although I must admit, I am sometimes a bit cowardly at &quot;going against the grain&quot;.   I&#39;m trying, but it seems NOTHING is ever easy, least of all rearing lively, sociable, high-strung children with a father who is ultra quiet and introverted!   <br/>\n<br/>\nI have lurked here long enough to realize there are many GOOD, well-thought diversities of opinion here, and I admire the spunk of so many of you for taking a divergent path from the usual/average way most of the masses allow themselves to be carried along.  Thanks in advance for your input!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMs T<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42142,"nextTopicId":41345}}
