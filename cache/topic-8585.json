The time is NOW for students in<br/>\nthe tenth grade (&quot;high school sophomores&quot;) to prepare for getting<br/>\ninto college. I have a free on-line resource for parents and<br/>\nstudents preparing for college, with special helps for<br/>\nhomeschooling families.

The Colleges That Admit Homeschoolers FAQ is<br/>\nrecommended by professional journalists and other researchers, for<br/>\nexample the editors of the Newsweek magazine October 5, 1998 cover<br/>\nstory about homeschooling and the Education Week recent story<br/>\nabout homeschoolers and college admission<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/ew_printstory.cfm?slug=29home.h19\">http://www.edweek.org/ew/ew_printstory.cfm?slug=29home.h19</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCheck the main FAQ page<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html\">http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand the several linked subpages for information about more than<br/>\n1,010 accredited colleges known to have admitted homeschoolers,<br/>\nincluding links to more than 990 college Web sites.

I&#39;m always eager to add names of<br/>\naccredited colleges to the FAQ, based on verifiable information<br/>\nfrom people in the know. I owe a big thank you to hundreds of<br/>\nparents and college admission officers who have helped me<br/>\npersonally verify the names of more than 710 colleges that have<br/>\nadmitted homeschoolers. Your reports confirming, correcting, or<br/>\nclarifying the information in the FAQ are always welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nKarl M. Bunday   &quot;pray for us&quot; 2 Thessalonians 3:1<br/>\nP.O.
