It really is important to know in advance. The most common <br/>\ncause of writer&#39;s block is fear of being criticized, judged or simply found out to be a <br/>\npoor writer.<br/>\n<br/>\nPositive feedback actually creates more progress in writing than any amount of <br/>\n&quot;constructive criticsm&quot; when dealing with resistant or even risk-taking writers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even kids who say they want their work to be criticzed are often tricking <br/>\nthemselves. What they&#39;re really saying is this: &quot;I know you usually only give positive <br/>\nfeedback. I want to know that what I wrote is actually really good so if I tell you I want <br/>\ncriticism, it&#39;s so that I&#39;ll know you *could* give it but don&#39;t because what I&#39;ve written is <br/>\nsoooo good.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t just apply to kids, by the way. I&#39;ve been an editor for nearly ten years. <br/>\nMost people who ask for criticism think their writing doesn&#39;t need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut some kids/adults really are ready to deal with their work in a more disciplined, <br/>\nmature way. One way to know this is to find the positive things but then to hone in on <br/>\none substantive issue (a mistake that has to do with meaning rather than just <br/>\ngrammar or punctuation). Choose only one thing. Focus on clarifying a vague <br/>\ncomment or adding support to an idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee how that goes and then it&#39;s possible to give more feedback. The act of writing <br/>\nitself is a huge teacher. Getting feedback that is supportive but accurate (that believes <br/>\nin the writer&#39;s ability to deliver) is the next level.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie Bogart<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bravewriter.com\">http://www.bravewriter.com</a><br/>\nOnline writing help for homeschool</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.

I<br/>\nreally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feel bad when he gets so frustrated, and want him to be able to know<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; his art IS appreciated, even if he doesn&#39;t think it is worthy!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Erika  :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check out the coupons and bargains on MSN Offers!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://shopping.msn.com/softcontent/softcontent.aspx?scmId=1418\">http://shopping.msn.com/softcontent/softcontent.aspx?scmId=1418</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!

(Remember my kids are 6, 5 an 3.5--I try not to speak condescendingly, but I do sometimes have to phrase things a bit differently.) And those are the kinds of things I *have* said to artists in art galleries and writers at conferences that have spawned really interesting conversations.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, when my good friend brings his photo portfolio, dh and I will look through it with him, analyzing each photo. He&#39;s trying to do stuff with his art, so he really looks forward to sharing it with people who will draw him out. (He&#39;s even sent us photos over email while he&#39;s working on a piece.) Kind of in the same way I would appreciate someone commenting on my writing. Not as a teacher, but definitely as someone who&#39;s engaged with it and wanting to offer thoughtful suggestions or comments. When a peer reads something I&#39;ve written and says something like, &quot;Gee, I really liked the way you phrased x, but what were you really getting at? Can you tell me more about that?&quot; I don&#39;t think they&#39;re being condescending; I think they&#39;re trying to get me to dig deeper into the topic that I&#39;m exploring. Now, it would be annoying if they were saying that, all the while knowing where they wanted me to end up and not saying it. But if they are trying to get me to go further because they&#39;re interested and offering their own thoughts and commentaries along the way, then that is a wonderful intellectual exchange that I really value. Kind of like this list! &gt;g&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI definitely *would* say, &quot;Oh, I really like the lines in this one. It&#39;s so linear. We&#39;re you trying to do something specific here?&quot; Often I will say, &quot;Tell me more about this!&quot; because lots of times he&#39;s doing really subtle political commentary in his work. I might catch on, but lots of times I don&#39;t. And as with writing, I may not be getting it because I&#39;m just not catching on, or it may indicate that he needs to go back and tweak it a bit more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith art, writing, whatever, when someone trusts a person enough to show them a work in progress, I believe that the artist/ writer genuinely wants some input. We don&#39;t always like the input we get &gt;g&lt;, and there are times where we really do just want a pat on the back.  But if all we get are pats on the back, pretty soon, chances are we&#39;re going to stop trusting that person&#39;s opinion. <br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Praise question...","postDate":"1075078800","msgId":89851,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1Ny4yYzNmY2Y2NS4yZDQ1YzA5MEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":89844,"nextInTopic":89853,"prevInTime":89850,"nextInTime":89852,"topicId":89815,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/25/04 11:30:33 AM, danielle.conger@comcast.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-926831373\">In a message dated 1/25/04 11:30:33 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danielle.conger@...\">danielle.conger@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; In terms of the art, I really would express more praise than &quot;I see lots <br/>\nof lines,&quot; though.

The point is that the praise should be a genuine response, not the kind of empty praise some parents, grandparents, teachers (well-meaning) people tend to give. I personally always try to avoid the superlative when talking to my kids; I just don&#39;t use best, perfect, greatest, etc. I think that sets up a false expectation and falls into the negative kind of praise. The magazine _Life Learning_ has a columnist who has talked about this issue, also focusing on the idea that praise must be genuine. I remember her making the point that instead of saying how great the child was for helping that a parent should instead express the true feeling of how great it felt to have the help, or something like that. She would say, &quot;thank you so much, that was really helpful to me.&quot; This isn&#39;t praise as a reward in hopes of having future help, but rather genuine praise that focuses on the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of the art, I really would express more praise than &quot;I see lots of lines,&quot; though. I might say something like, &quot;I like the way you&#39;re working with lines here. Were you trying to achieve a particular affect with that? Can you tell me more about it?&quot; Art is often intended to provoke a response in others. If we don&#39;t have a response when our children show us something they&#39;ve worked to create, then I can easily see that evoking a certain sense of failure. One of my best friends is an artist, and I love looking through his photo portfolio when he comes to visit. Looking through it, I always say things like &quot;I really like the colors in this one,&quot; or &quot;the depth of this one is amazing.&quot; Yes, it&#39;s purely subjective, but that&#39;s what art is--how it affects a particular viewer. I think he&#39;d be really disappointed if I had no reaction or nothing to say when he showed me photos of his work other than &quot;you&#39;ve used a lot of green,&quot; you know?<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"Genant2@aol.com","from":"Genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Praise question...","postDate":"1075050325","msgId":89829,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM1LjNkNmYzZDc3LjJkNDU1MTU1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":89828,"nextInTopic":89833,"prevInTime":89828,"nextInTime":89830,"topicId":89815,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/25/04 11:54:17 AM Eastern Standard Time, BonKnit@aol.com ...

He talking <br/>\nabout consciously trying to mold or &quot;condition&quot; a child - by using <br/>\n&quot;positive reinforcement&quot; to encourage the behaviors they want the child <br/>\nto increase. Probably most of us have seen parents like this (or been <br/>\nparents like this) - it is standard-operating-procedure at least in <br/>\nmiddle class families and is taken very much for granted, and also to <br/>\nextremes, in most classrooms. Once you start to see it for what it is, <br/>\nit all looks very very obviously insulting to the child - treating them <br/>\nlike lab rats who get rewarded with a food pellet for running through a <br/>\nmaze.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my oldest does ceramics out of passionate love for the art. My <br/>\nmiddle daughter sings because she is a singer - it is just a part her <br/>\nof. And my youngest plays soccer for the sheer joy of it - not in order <br/>\nto hear me praise her playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing the promise of praise as a reward is no different than using <br/>\nwithholding of praise as a punishment. But that doesn&#39;t mean that every <br/>\ntime we say something nice to our kids, comment on something we think <br/>\nthey&#39;ve done well, show appreciation and enjoyment of their talents and <br/>\nabilities - that we&#39;re hooking them on praise. Have an authentic <br/>\nrelationship - don&#39;t &quot;use&quot; praise to try to control. Enjoy each other <br/>\ngenuinely. Be honest and real.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what is on the flap of Alfie Kohn&#39;s book, &quot;Punished by Rewards: <br/>\nThe Trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A&#39;s, Praise, and Other <br/>\nBribes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n*********<br/>\nOur basic strategy for raising children, teaching students, and <br/>\nmanaging workers can be summarized in six words: Do this and you&#39;ll get <br/>\nthat. We dangle goodies (from candy bars to sales commissions) in front <br/>\nof people in much the same way that we train the family pet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this groundbreaking book, Alfie Kohn shows that while manipulating <br/>\npeople with incentives seems to work in the short run, it is a strategy <br/>\nthat ultimately fails and even does lasting harm. Our workplaces and <br/>\nclassrooms will continue to decline, he argues, until we begin to <br/>\nquestion our reliance on a theory of motivation derived from laboratory <br/>\nanimals.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrawing from hundreds of studies, Kohn demonstrates that people <br/>\nactually do inferior work when they are enticed with money, grades, or <br/>\nother incentives. Programs that use rewards to change people&#39;s behavior <br/>\nare similarly ineffective over the long run. Promising goodies to <br/>\nchildren for good behavior can never produce anything more than <br/>\ntemporary obedience. In fact, the more we use artificial inducements to <br/>\nmotivate people, the more they lose interest in what we&#39;re bribing them <br/>\nto do. Rewards turn play into work, and work into drudgery.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep by step, Kohn marshals research and logic to prove that <br/>\npay-for-performance plans cannot work; the more an organization relies <br/>\non incentives, the worse things get. Parents and teachers who care <br/>\nabout helping students to learn, meanwhile, should be doing everything <br/>\npossible to help them forget that grades exist. Even praise can become <br/>\na verbal bribe that gets kids hooked on our approval.<br/>\n<br/>\nRewards and punishments are just two sides of the same coin -- and the <br/>\ncoin doesn&#39;t buy very much. What is needed, Kohn explains, is an <br/>\nalternative to both ways of controlling people. The final chapters <br/>\noffer a practical set of strategies for parents, teachers, and managers <br/>\nthat move beyond the use of carrots or sticks. Seasoned with humor and <br/>\nfamiliar examples, Punished by Rewards presents an argument that is <br/>\nunsettling to hear but impossible to dismiss.<br/>\n<br/>\n****************<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nWhen I think back<br/>\nOn all the crap I learned in high school<br/>\nIt&#39;s a wonder<br/>\nI can think at all<br/>\n~~~Paul Simon (Kodachrome)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Praise question...","postDate":"1075047305","msgId":89824,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ1LjNjNmIxYzQuMmQ0NTQ1ODlAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":89822,"nextInTopic":89827,"prevInTime":89823,"nextInTime":89825,"topicId":89815,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/25/04 8:00:25 AM, ivorygrace7@aol.com writes:  That s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1560101317\">In a message dated 1/25/04 8:00:25 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ivorygrace7@...\">ivorygrace7@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; just as I would if an <br/>\nadult friend asked me about something they were doing! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I was going to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think of how I would respond to an adult friend.
