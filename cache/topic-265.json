I was such a nervous wreck last year doing my <br/>\nportfolio review but I think I did a good job. I know I had read the law <br/>\nsays they only have to see examples but cant comment on the quality. Well <br/>\nthis guy did. I was told the material I was giving my daughter was to hard. <br/>\nShe wanted to do it and did it well so I didnt see a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I will just bring one example this year should I get a call. I <br/>\nfigured taking in my daughters report on a Native American tribe she did <br/>\nwill count for Social studies and launguage arts and then bring in a math <br/>\nassingment she did. I am honestly hopeing ...as bad as this sounds...that if <br/>\nI do get a phone call and go that the shear site of me being 8 months <br/>\npregnant will make him nervous and let me out of there. *L* Anyhow I do have <br/>\na list of books the kids read so I will shove that in the folder to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the imput I dont feel so stressed now. I just couldnt figure a <br/>\nway to show the things you dont do on paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings<br/>\nshelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
