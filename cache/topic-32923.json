They mostly watch<br/>\n&gt; PBS kids and Nick Jr. shows.  If there are other shows on that we don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; consider harmful, they can see them - Megan watched Modern Masters on<br/>\n&gt; HGTV last night.  I don&#39;t let her watch much Carol Duvall though since<br/>\n&gt; Carol is such a &quot;poor, incompetent me&quot; person (or was the last time I<br/>\n&gt; watched it).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree. DH&#39;s grandma raved about this woman so I checked it out when we<br/>\nhad DirecTV. She does the &quot;oh, *I* would never be able to do that, you&#39;re<br/>\nso talented&quot; spiel. I think she means it as a compliment to the other<br/>\nperson but it comes out as a put down of herself. She really could be a<br/>\ngood role model if she allowed herself to be; she does seem to have talent<br/>\nand she come across as such a nice person.<br/>\n<br/>\nButtons</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32860,"nextTopicId":32434}}
