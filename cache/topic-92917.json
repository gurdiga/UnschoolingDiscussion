I have managed to do many jobs, have<br/>\nfriends, find love, and have interesting conversations as an adult who<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know tons of the things that the school system here considers core<br/>\ncurriculum - I would probably be a Jaywalking Allstar, if you have watched<br/>\nLeno at all. I can&#39;t name all the States probably, let alone the capitals,<br/>\nor list all the Presidents. At home I was the equivalent of valedictorian.<br/>\nThey made a movie about Columbus didn&#39;t they? Did it include the horrors he<br/>\nand his crews perpetrated in Haiti? School level information is often not<br/>\nremotely complete. Philosophical issue: is any amount of information the<br/>\nwhole story on any subject, or is there always more to learn? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat *if* a kid never sparks Columbus or [insert topic here]? How would his<br/>\nlife therefore be impossible - now or later? Is there some age limit in your<br/>\nmind about when he needs to have these sparks by to count? Some people find<br/>\ncompletely new interests as adults. What could happen to him? One thing is<br/>\nthat other people may try to quiz him with offensive questions, as people<br/>\nsometimes do when they find out someone is homeschooled. They do that to all<br/>\nhomeschoolers. These interrogators are rude if adults, and have been<br/>\nbrainwashed if school children. Jayn mostly refuses to answer, regardless of<br/>\nwhether she knows the answer, preferring to initiate real conversations<br/>\nabout her current interests. DH and I usually say, &quot;She won&#39;t be a<br/>\nperforming monkey&quot; to stop them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a great and abiding interest in  eg: Columbus, and have the<br/>\ninformation around the house - maybe even the movie I mentioned or some<br/>\nbooks with great illustrations or some ship models or a TV series comes on<br/>\nor...this is strewing I guess. He may spark something from your passion<br/>\nabout your subject - or not. OTOH, if you are forcing yourself to read about<br/>\neg: Columbus and going rigid with boredom, or getting a tension headache<br/>\nevery time you think about the reading you &quot;must&quot; do to make sure he sees it<br/>\nis important to learn about eg:Columbus, I think you are likely to smother<br/>\nany spark that occurs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it is something to ponder: whether there really is any particular<br/>\npiece of school type knowledge that is essential to a happy life for a child<br/>\nin the market economy democracy called the USA. (I&#39;m not talking about<br/>\nskills - you say he knows how to read so he is already doing very well<br/>\nindeed. If a skill is entirely used in a school setting, then it is beyond<br/>\nirrelevant to our family. If it is useful in real life then it will be<br/>\nlearned at the time.)
