She was concerned because her spelling was<br/>\nbelow &quot;grade level&quot; and she felt self-conscious about writing stuff that<br/>\nother people would see (and part of this may stem from an episode in<br/>\nbrownies when a kid asked her &quot;What *grade * are you in?&quot; after she asked<br/>\nthe group how to spell a word). We tossed around some ideas but we we<br/>\nended up doing was getting a copy of the Dolch list and I orally quizzed<br/>\nher on each word list. After we&#39;d done a list, I wrote up a list of the<br/>\nwords that she had missed (if she missed one but said &quot;Oh, yeah, I know<br/>\nthat!&quot; it didn&#39;t go on the list; if she got it right but wanted it on the<br/>\nlist because she felt shaky with it it did). Then I put words up one at a<br/>\ntime on our whiteboard. At first I just printed them, but early on she<br/>\ndecided she&#39;d like to pratice cursive while she was at it, so I would do<br/>\ncursive and printed. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt whatever point she felt like it, she would go and learn the word -<br/>\nusually she&#39;d write it a few times in print and cursive - and then check<br/>\nit off as done. I&#39;d erase it and do the next one. We started a word box<br/>\nin the corner of the board for a while, but then she got through too many<br/>\nand it took up too much room. I think she made it through four Dolch<br/>\nlists before she tired of it all, in a period of maybe 2 months.<br/>\nOccasionally she&#39;d ask me to quiz her on the ones she&#39;d already done, and<br/>\nshe retained almost all of them, as I recall.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t done an &quot;spelling&quot; for a couple of months now, although she&#39;s<br/>\nstarted doing some emailing.

Other unschooling lists might be different.  <br/>\nI guess what you see as bickering I see as discussion.   And I think<br/>\nlearning new things requires a lot of judgement.  A lot, and maybe I&#39;m<br/>\nnot as squeamish about &quot;judgements&quot; as some because I don&#39;t give a poo<br/>\npoo for a person who doesn&#39;t have any judgement.    Holy cow!    If I<br/>\nhadn&#39;t made a judgement that there was something better than school where<br/>\nwould my son be today?   If I hadn&#39;t made a judgement that there was a<br/>\nbetter way to think and a better way to live,  his life wouldn&#39;t be as<br/>\ngood as it is now.   It&#39;s all about judgement.<br/>\nIf someone asks I going to tell them what I think is better.  If I hadn&#39;t<br/>\njudged it to be better, why would I do it? <br/>\n<br/>\nAND, folks here love opinions!   Couldn&#39;t you tell?&lt;G&gt;    They may get<br/>\nquestioned and challenged but if they&#39;re worth having, then they&#39;re worth<br/>\nexplaining.   <br/>\nThis seems like a good time all around to look at the intro to this list<br/>\nagain.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Unschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn<br/>\nwhat they need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling<br/>\nparent is a facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning<br/>\nwith curiosity and enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the<br/>\nwhat, when, where and how of their learning -- from mud puddles to<br/>\nShakespeare to Spongebob Squarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or<br/>\nyou&#39;d like to find out more about how video games and life in general are<br/>\nfilled with learning, come join us! <br/>\nAs discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling<br/>\nis *not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed<br/>\nlearning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest<br/>\nin unschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you<br/>\nkeep in mind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in<br/>\nways designed to help each other become unschoolers or become better at<br/>\nunschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a<br/>\n&quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since many listmembers love a lively<br/>\ndebate and questioning beliefs to their foundations.***<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2099467,"authorName":"EBA7009@aol.com","from":"EBA7009@...","profile":"mikemom3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: school at homers/spelling","postDate":"1037894598","msgId":50395,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4OC4xMTRhMjI3YS4yYjBlNWRjNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":50394,"nextInTopic":50398,"prevInTime":50394,"nextInTime":50396,"topicId":50343,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/21/02 3:38:15 PM !!!First Boot!!!, ddzimlew@juno.com ...

At first he was<br/>\nreally into it and was paying attention and getting it. Then a few<br/>\nminutes later he got bored. Fine, I continued to play with it...just<br/>\nwanted to see what it could do, and I thought if he was it in action he<br/>\nwould be interested. He watched me play then came back. We sat together<br/>\nfor about 20 minutes &quot;doing&quot; phonics and spelling. To me this feels like<br/>\nunschooling, but it was not totally his idea to play with it the<br/>\n&quot;correct&quot; way, I lead that. But it was his decision to leave the game,<br/>\nthen observe me and return to it. I am also looking into phonics<br/>\nprograms and books (like Hooked on Phonics).

I am not so sure that newbies to unschooling would get any helpful support here?  Why am I still here?  Because I am hoping that when I need some help maybe it will be a calm day and I will be able to get some advice and guidance not peppered by hostility or holier then thou attitudes.  But from an &quot;outsider&quot; looking in that is what I have seen.  I don&#39;t dare say I am perfect.  Nor what I do in a day with my children is perfect.  Thou I do strive to do my best and I believe child initiated learning is ideal.  I would not pass judgment on how other families define unschooling.  If my 12 you wants to do a worksheet I let him.  If they want me to check spelling GREAT I will do it.  My definition of unschool is allowing my children to learn in an environment free from boundaries.  It is allowing them choices to decide HOW they want to learn be it games, reading, internet, hand on, tv, and most important just playing and living...<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry   <br/>\nUnschooling Soap Diva WAHM to 4 :o)<br/>\n&quot;Education is not the filling of a bucket, but the lighting of a fire.&quot; <br/>\nWm.

But when it&#39;s my <br/>\nbusiness computer, in my office, and my 8 year old daughter is using <br/>\nit to IM on a chess and chat site at which I had observed several <br/>\nplayers who clearly were not behaving like young kids, though they <br/>\nclaimed to be, I think I have a right to oversee the situation.  And <br/>\nsince she was doing something she wanted to do, was highly motivated <br/>\nto do, I decided to motivate her a little more to polish up her <br/>\nspelling while she was at it.  She did, and is a good speller now. I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t ever have to do it again after she gave up the chess & chat <br/>\nsite because the players began to show their true colors, with foul <br/>\nlanguage, sexual innuendo and other unpleasant online behavior.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s just one way I do &quot;unschooling&quot;:  I make use of whatever <br/>\nopportunity presents itself.  But, sure, why not assume the worst of <br/>\nanyone.  Maybe that is not what you would have done.  So what?  I saw <br/>\nit as a great opportunity.  It worked, all around.  She wanted to <br/>\nplay chess online and chat and I needed to supervise that online <br/>\ntime, so might as well make it work.  Besides, I see nothing wrong <br/>\nwith encouraging a child who is choosing to communicate in written <br/>\nform to spell and communicate correctly, to learn to check her <br/>\nspelling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou all act like I was making her do spelling lessons, or work <br/>\nsheets.  Or I was standing over her with a whip.  Yes, I ALLOWED her <br/>\nto use my office machine, under my supervision because of her age and <br/>\nwhat she wanted to do, what I had observed on that particular site, <br/>\nbut suggesting that she also learn to check her spelling while she <br/>\ndid this was a good move, one that I have never had to repeat since.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think this is an unschooling list at all, but an &quot;if you <br/>\ndon&#39;t do it just like we do it, then you&#39;re not doing it right&quot; <br/>\nlist.
