Most cases (80%) are cured within a year.  Some become<br/>\nchronic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are only about 100 cases a year in the U.S. and a lot of those were<br/>\nacquired while folks were traveling, particularly to Mexico where they sell<br/>\nunpasterized goat milk and cheese.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, TB is a whole other story with about 18,000 cases a year but those are<br/>\nrarely from milk but brought here by refugees.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to testing, the blood test for animals is one way but for milk you do a<br/>\nring test.

It does increase <br/>\ntheir production therefore increases $$$$$ but for these poor <br/>\nanimals that are just a factory to the farmers it may not make life <br/>\nany better.   I have seen a farm locally where they remove the <br/>\ncalves tails so that the cows aren&#39;t as likely to splatter you-know-<br/>\nwhat all over the place in the milking parlor.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost cows don&#39;t need to be rounded up, they just head for the <br/>\nbarn, and in big dairy operations they are often not far from the barn <br/>\nanyway, they are often kept in small muddy crappy areas with no <br/>\naccess to pasture.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur cattle live on a pile of grass, wood chips & leaves which is <br/>\nabout 100&#39; long 30&#39; wide and up to 15&#39; high, this is all dumped here <br/>\nby local gardeners and tree trimmers.   In winter they would prefer <br/>\nto be on the pile than in the barn as it heats from the composting <br/>\naction.  In spring, summer and fall [except in really wet weather] <br/>\nthey have access  to several acres of pasture but seem to prefer to <br/>\nbe up in the yard waiting for people to bring them fresh grass <br/>\nclippings.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmall is beautiful in farming, the bigger a farm gets the more <br/>\ninhumane the treatment of the animals often becomes.  They are <br/>\nno longer animals, just machines there to produce a product.  Last <br/>\nyear when the power went out after a big storm a pig factory near <br/>\nhere lost hundreds of animals, without the huge fans going to <br/>\nremove the stale air toxic gasses built up and killed all the pigs in <br/>\nthe confinement housing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo see pigs living in these places is sickening, to know that these <br/>\nare intelligent creatures and being kept in small prison cells with <br/>\nnothing to do is very sad.  I love to watch our two sows as they go <br/>\nabout their days, rooting through the ground in search of some <br/>\nburied treasure, digging mud puddles with those amazing noses, <br/>\nloafing in the pond on hot days and building thick straw nests for <br/>\nthemselves when the weather turns cool.   Just yesterday we gave <br/>\nour two five week old piglets a whole bale of hay to play with, they <br/>\nhave been busily going through it, eating the oats and making a <br/>\nbed with some of the straw, it was cool last night, and they <br/>\nprobably made themselves very cosy. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSue<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Winona Farm in Minnesota Welcomes Unschoolers All Year Round<br/>\nMy website:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e\">http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e</a><br/>\nFarm website:    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/\">http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/</a><br/>\nFarm newsletter: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To believe in something, and not to live it,<br/>\n is to be dishonest.&quot;   -Mahatma Gandhi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"jYLW613dR792Agrf1YWWCCyvbw8jEEqYsDeW5-DxI9yJhFPMhzrBLfDssgHjCxN4cD4d2J7RJuFbpcUK7la1JnkmUCBIYUkARi3kC--JtIRDzTXFZg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"cows","postDate":"963925485","msgId":11284,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5NzQ2M0ZELjE2Mjg1LkJBMjhCOUBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDAwNzE3MTM0MjQ4LjM5MTgucW1haWxAd2ViOTAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11274,"nextInTopic":11310,"prevInTime":11283,"nextInTime":11285,"topicId":11157,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is something I ve thought about, not in terms of caring for one myself, but would it be feasible to milk cows more often than the usual dawn and dusk","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1644518670\">This is something I&#39;ve thought about, not in terms of caring for one <br/>\nmyself, but would it be feasible to milk cows more often than the <br/>\nusual dawn and dusk scenario?

Most ground beef is a<br/>\ncombination of Australian bull meat (nice red color and little or no fat)<br/>\nand scraps or trimmings from breaking a beef.  For example, it is no longer<br/>\npopular to leave the &quot;tail&quot; on a t-bone steak.  The tail goes in the<br/>\nhamburger.  When you break a beef (cut it into smaller sections from the<br/>\n1/4&#39;s it arrives in), there are parts to the round, chuck, neck, and<br/>\nsirloin tip area that are not sold as steaks or used as stew meat or the<br/>\nold fashioned &quot;cube&quot; steak.  That is your hamburger.  Beef is much cheaper<br/>\nto buy than pork.   You can buy utility grade fores for about 1/4 to 1/2<br/>\nthe price of a hanging half or whole carcass hog.  If you added a &quot;white&quot;<br/>\nmeat (pork or turkey) to your hamburger you would get an anemic looking<br/>\nhamburger.  Also, hamburger is sent through the grinder twice, something<br/>\nyou can&#39;t do with pork unless you want a real nasty greasy looking mess.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only way there could have been a problem is if the grinder was used<br/>\nwithout a complete breakdown after the buther made his sausage or ground<br/>\npork.  Had he allowed it to sit around or did not clean it properly, then<br/>\nyou would have a problem.  But, if you read your papers, you will find that<br/>\nmost, if not all of the food poisoning cases come from ground beef that is<br/>\nmass produced and all the recalls have come from these mass production<br/>\nfolks, as have all the deaths from e-coli.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to name brands being &quot;what you pay for,&quot; that is a myth.  It is the big<br/>\nnames that just finished paying back bucko bucks in fines because they were<br/>\nselling utility grade beef as prime, who were using special lights and food<br/>\ncoloring to make the cuts of meat appealing and who were watering their<br/>\nhamburger inorder to get more money.  It is also the major brands that were<br/>\nputting kangaroo meat in their hamburger.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, on to trichinosis.  The symptoms are not even vaguely like e-coli<br/>\n(Symptoms:diarrhea that is acute, bloody and severe vomiting (although<br/>\nrare) loss of appetite abdominal pain so severe it is compared with<br/>\nlabor.)  In fact, there are no symptoms until usually 8 to 15 days after<br/>\neating the meat with the earliest being 5 days and the outside being 45<br/>\ndays.  The symptoms usually start with fever, muscle soreness, pain and<br/>\nswelling around the eyes. Thirst, profuse sweating, chills, weakness and<br/>\ntiredness may develop. Chest pain may be experienced since the parasite may<br/>\nbecome imbedded in the diaphragm (the thin muscle separating the lungs from<br/>\nabdominal organs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, for the unschooling tidbit for the day, in California (and probably the<br/>\nrest of the states since it is all the same union), a butcher has to go to<br/>\nschool and learn all about disease that may be transmitted to humans from<br/>\nmeat, sterilization techniques and then must apprentise with a journeyman<br/>\nbutcher.  However, the folks that do the slaughtering and the mass<br/>\nproducing are only &quot;helpers&quot; and do not need to go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Corallyn Berger &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hape2day@...\">hape2day@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] raw foods<br/>\n&gt; Date: Monday, July 17, 2000 5:56 AM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There was a story in the news here a few years ago<br/>\n&gt; about a man who had a bar-b-q and cooked his hamberger<br/>\n&gt; med rare.

I guess what I&#39;m saying is<br/>\n&gt; that you can eat meat and still go natural just buy<br/>\n&gt; raising your own beef. I think mom said it cost her<br/>\n&gt; about $1.50/lb for the meat she got off the cow, abt<br/>\n&gt; 400lb. That included the cost of raising and<br/>\n&gt; slautering it.
