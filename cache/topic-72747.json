Kass and Kree were dying <br/>\n  to buy me a computer chair for Mother&#39;s Day. They kept hinting around for <br/>\n  weeks before about how bad my back must hurt sitting in the lawn chair I was <br/>\n  using. Then they went on to how embarrassing it must be when people come in my <br/>\n  bedroom and see a backyard chair at my computer. I knew where they were headed and <br/>\n  told them that my chair was just fine and computer chairs are pretty pricey <br/>\n  and just not a priority right now. The Sunday before Mother&#39;s Day, they looked <br/>\n  at all the ads in the newspaper for chairs. I could see they were a little <br/>\n  shocked at the expense of the chairs they wanted for me. Of course I pretended to <br/>\n  not notice that they were only looking at those ads. They started getting a <br/>\n  little down about it, then disappeared. I left the ads out for most of the day <br/>\n  and then threw them out. The next Saturday they went to the desert to quad <br/>\n  ride with my DH and his friends. I was in bad shape and welcomed the solitude to <br/>\n  stay in bed all day. When they arrived home that afternoon, I had just <br/>\n  showered and changed into new pajamas. They came in tired and filthy from riding in <br/>\n  some mud and said, &quot;We&#39;re hittin the showers mom, can you get dressed while we <br/>\n  get ready?&quot; Huh? I wanted to climb back in bed. Dh walked in and said,&quot;Did the <br/>\n  babies tell you to get dressed? They want you to go with us to pick out a <br/>\n  computer chair for your Mother&#39;s Day present.&quot; I argued the need and the expense <br/>\n  and he said, &quot;They came to me with the whole plan, you can&#39;t disappoint them.&quot; <br/>\n  He said they had put their money together and came up with $46. They told him <br/>\n  that they had enough for a chair, but not the kind they thought I deserved <br/>\n  and could he help? He was so excited that they were willing to part with every <br/>\n  cent they had for my gift that he said, &quot;Sure I&#39;ll put in too.&quot; Then they hit <br/>\n  him with the next question,&quot;Do we have to pay you back, since she&#39;s not your <br/>\n  mother?&quot; He said he couldn&#39;t help but crack up at their concern. He told <br/>\n  them,&quot;Nah, you don&#39;t have to pay me back since without me she wouldn&#39;t be your <br/>\n  mother.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] father&#39;s day","postDate":"1055138892","msgId":73137,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCMDlFRUFFLjI4NEQlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNTUxMTEzMDguMTUwMC42MDg0Ny5tMTVAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":73097,"nextInTopic":73149,"prevInTime":73136,"nextInTime":73138,"topicId":72747,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Leonore, My husband is out and about, so no desk job.

Kass and Kree were dying <br/>\nto buy me a computer chair for Mother&#39;s Day. They kept hinting around for <br/>\nweeks before about how bad my back must hurt sitting in the lawn chair I was <br/>\nusing. Then they went on to how embarrassing it must be when people come in my <br/>\nbedroom and see a backyard chair at my computer. I knew where they were headed and <br/>\ntold them that my chair was just fine and computer chairs are pretty pricey <br/>\nand just not a priority right now. The Sunday before Mother&#39;s Day, they looked <br/>\nat all the ads in the newspaper for chairs. I could see they were a little <br/>\nshocked at the expense of the chairs they wanted for me. Of course I pretended to <br/>\nnot notice that they were only looking at those ads. They started getting a <br/>\nlittle down about it, then disappeared. I left the ads out for most of the day <br/>\nand then threw them out. The next Saturday they went to the desert to quad <br/>\nride with my DH and his friends. I was in bad shape and welcomed the solitude to <br/>\nstay in bed all day. When they arrived home that afternoon, I had just <br/>\nshowered and changed into new pajamas. They came in tired and filthy from riding in <br/>\nsome mud and said, &quot;We&#39;re hittin the showers mom, can you get dressed while we <br/>\nget ready?&quot; Huh? I wanted to climb back in bed. Dh walked in and said,&quot;Did the <br/>\nbabies tell you to get dressed? They want you to go with us to pick out a <br/>\ncomputer chair for your Mother&#39;s Day present.&quot; I argued the need and the expense <br/>\nand he said, &quot;They came to me with the whole plan, you can&#39;t disappoint them.&quot; <br/>\nHe said they had put their money together and came up with $46. They told him <br/>\nthat they had enough for a chair, but not the kind they thought I deserved <br/>\nand could he help? He was so excited that they were willing to part with every <br/>\ncent they had for my gift that he said, &quot;Sure I&#39;ll put in too.&quot; Then they hit <br/>\nhim with the next question,&quot;Do we have to pay you back, since she&#39;s not your <br/>\nmother?&quot; He said he couldn&#39;t help but crack up at their concern. He told <br/>\nthem,&quot;Nah, you don&#39;t have to pay me back since without me she wouldn&#39;t be your <br/>\nmother.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI got dressed and off we went to hunt out my perfect chair. We found it at <br/>\nLowes hardware store and it was on sale too!!! This brings me to a whole nother <br/>\nthread about respect that children don&#39;t get.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe chair came in this humongous box that was really heavy. The girls went <br/>\nand retrieved one of those pallet type carts so their Daddy could put it on and <br/>\nthey could take it to the cashier. While walking thru the store my DH gave <br/>\nthem a hundred dollar bill to use with their money to pay for it. We walked past <br/>\nthem while they waited in line. Apparently there was some special that Lowes <br/>\ncard holders were getting that weekend and they were getting 10% off their <br/>\npurchases. Problem was not one of the cashiers knew how to use this discount. We <br/>\nwaited as we watched all the cashiers clamor about trying to figure out how <br/>\ndiscount their customers. Each one was on the phone or shouting back and forth to <br/>\nanother cashier. It was comedy. Kass and Kree just stood in line rolling <br/>\ntheir eyes over the incompetence that was so obvious. Phil and I just laughed and <br/>\ndecided to go outside and look at the sidewalk stuff while the girls waited to <br/>\nmake their purchase. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter another 10 minutes, I stopped listening to my chattering hubby and <br/>\nwatched the girls inside as they were in deep conversation with the check out <br/>\ngirl. He finally noticed I wasn&#39;t listening and asked, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; I replied, <br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t know, but the girls look pissed.&quot; I started to walk back in when he <br/>\nstopped me and said, &quot;They can handle themselves, Rhonda, just wait.&quot; He was <br/>\nright. When they finally came outside with the pallet cart, they were pissed. <br/>\nPhil asked, &quot;What took you so long?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were just disgusted and said,&quot;First daddy, did you see how poor their <br/>\ncustomer service was? How can they not know how to calculate 10%?&quot; I laughed <br/>\nbecause I didn&#39;t know they knew how to calculate 10%. They continued, &quot;Then after <br/>\none of them got a clue, they had the nerve to ask us if we were shopping <br/>\nalone. Now how I ask you, do they think we got this big ass chair on this pallet? <br/>\nWe told that chick, &#39;no our parents are outside because they got tired of <br/>\nwaiting for you to figure out 10%. So can we have our receipt?&#39; Can you believe <br/>\nthem daddy?&quot; He said, &quot;Well yeah, they probably aren&#39;t used to kids shopping at <br/>\nLowes and paying for things alone.&quot; Then the clencher was, &quot;Well the last time <br/>\nwe checked kids with money are comsumer&#39;s too. And isn&#39;t there some law that <br/>\nsays a kid can be on their own if a judge says so?&quot; I was floored. I said, &quot;Do <br/>\nyou mean an emancipated minor?&quot; I could see that I hit the nail on the head <br/>\nand they responded with, &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s it! I mean what if we were emancipated <br/>\nminors, would they not sell us the chair? Then again mom they probably wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nknow what that meant either since they couldn&#39;t figure out 10%, which by the <br/>\nway we told her how to figure that out too. I bet she went to school too.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to have rambled on so much but I just had the need to share. It always <br/>\namazes me how much our kids get from just living and I wish our lost poster <br/>\nwas still here to see what my unschooling automatons are treating the world <br/>\nlike.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] father&#39;s day","postDate":"1055012410","msgId":72762,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTYwMWMzMmQyNyQwNTI1MjI0MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDFhNy4xNTUzODIwZS4yYzEzODcwOEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":72758,"nextInTopic":72771,"prevInTime":72761,"nextInTime":72763,"topicId":72747,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From:   It pays to have responsible kids doesn t it??!!!

(just <br/>\ncomplains).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I priced DVD players but I hate to just charge it where he&#39;ll have to pay <br/>\nfor it.
