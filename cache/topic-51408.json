Jackson had all <br/>\nwomen companies, but I trained with men at Ft. Leonard Wood.  There&#39;s a <br/>\nplatoon of women in Jake&#39;s company, too, but I had heard that they stopped <br/>\ndoing that for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Jake has been in ROTC and has rank already.  He&#39;s among 3 or 4 in the <br/>\nwhole company who have rank.  The way he&#39;s describing what&#39;s happening is so <br/>\nvery familiar to me.  Although, he is in OSUT, where he stays right there for <br/>\nAIT and I wasn&#39;t.  I think, actually, that this is his last day of basic, and <br/>\nthey&#39;re starting his AIT next week.  So, he doesn&#39;t actually have graduation <br/>\nfrom basic like I did, but he does have one for the whole shebang sometime in <br/>\nthe spring.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI get to pick him up next week for Christmas and I&#39;m so happy!  Can&#39;t wait to <br/>\nsee his shaved little head and see how much of the college boy beer belly he <br/>\nburned off!<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128307542,"authorName":"Earthmomma67@aol.com","from":"Earthmomma67@...","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Basic training was Balance","postDate":"1039747789","msgId":51408,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhmLjI2NzUxYWNkLjJiMmFhNGNkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":51438,"prevInTime":51407,"nextInTime":51409,"topicId":51408,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I wonder when you and Tuck went through Basic training?
