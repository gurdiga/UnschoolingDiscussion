The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1190032785\">I would like to pass along some urgent information.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Democratic Party has now aligned itself squarely against <br/>\nhomeschooling and parental rights.  The Democratic National <br/>\nCommittee&#39;s website (www.dnc.org), endorsed by Al Gore, attacks <br/>\nRepublican Presidential nominee George W. Bush for being &quot;soft&quot; on <br/>\nhomeschooling.  That same website parrots<br/>\nthe agenda of the NEA, the nation&#39;s biggest teachers&#39; union, <br/>\ninsisting that all teachers of all children should be required to <br/>\npossess state certification.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat requirement would KILL homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt renews the threat of HR 6, which homeschoolers helped to kill in <br/>\n1994.  That bill would have required the same thing -- state <br/>\ncertification.  That means, unless you spend many thousands of <br/>\ndollars and several years taking courses in how to teach, you will <br/>\nnot be able to teach your child at home. That bill passed through the <br/>\nHouse Education Committee with every Democrat voting for it, and <br/>\nevery Republican voting against it. George Miller (D-Cal), then <br/>\nchairman of that committee, will become its chairman again if<br/>\nthe Democrats win control of the House, and has vowed to reintroduce <br/>\nthe bill.  This time, the Democrats would not be facing the imminent <br/>\ndisaster they faced in the 1994 elections, when Bill Clinton was at <br/>\nhis lowest in popularity.  They will have little to fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nIT IS DISHEARTENING TO ME THAT A MAJOR POLITICAL PARTY IN THE UNITED <br/>\nSTATES SHOULD SO BLITHELY ATTACK THE FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOM OF THE <br/>\nFAMILY.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is disheartening, but not surprising.  I teach at an American <br/>\ncollege; I know the left very well.  The Democratic Party is now <br/>\nwholly controlled by the left -- by people who believe that the <br/>\nstate, not the family, is the basic institution of society.<br/>\n<br/>\n*  That is why the left wants taxpayer-financed daycare.  Former <br/>\nfeminist, Elizabeth Genovese warns that public funded daycare is the <br/>\nnext arena of assault on the traditional family, and will make it <br/>\nmore and more difficult for tax-strapped families to keep the mother <br/>\nin the home, and more and more economically enticing to leave <br/>\nchildren with others.<br/>\n<br/>\n* That is why the left wants to destroy the Boy Scouts.  President <br/>\nClinton&#39;s Justice Department recently decided to examine whether the <br/>\nBoy Scouts should be banned from National Parks, because of their <br/>\nrefusal to admit homosexual scoutmasters.  Homosexuals do not mince <br/>\nwords when they assert that the<br/>\ntraditional family, and traditional manhood and womanhood, must be <br/>\novercome.<br/>\n<br/>\n*  That is why they despise homeschooling.  John Taylor Gatto has <br/>\nwritten a long article on the fight one small Vermont village waged <br/>\nto keep open the last one-room, public schoolhouse in the state.  The <br/>\npowerful Vermont chapter of the NEA crushed them.  When the left <br/>\ncannot abide even a traditional PUBLIC<br/>\nschool, what makes us think they will be friendlier with us <br/>\nhomeschoolers? To a tyrant any deviation from conformity, no matter <br/>\nhow apparently small, is a threat that must be wiped out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe homeschoolers have for a Presidential candidate the governor of <br/>\nthe most homeschooling-friendly state in the country, opposed by a <br/>\nparty that has cast its lot with:<br/>\n     * the NEA<br/>\n     * the feminists, who despise the traditional family<br/>\n     * nationalized curricula designed to teach children what they <br/>\nshould believe<br/>\n<br/>\nNOW IS NOT THE TIME TO BE COMPLACENT.  NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO SAY, &quot;I <br/>\nDON&#39;T UNDERSTAND POLITICS!&quot;  When will we get another opportunity <br/>\nlike the present?  And if we sit on our hands, what right will we <br/>\nhave to complain, when Hillary Clinton, who once compared the <br/>\ntraditional family to SLAVERY, sits on the Supreme Court, as she will <br/>\nsurely do, should Mr. Gore be elected?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so I urge you, contact your friends and relatives in other states <br/>\n-- those who are friendly to homeschooling.  Ask them to consider, <br/>\nthis year, whether the freedom of the family is worth preserving.  <br/>\nThis election will be close!  Of course you must vote as your <br/>\nconscience dictates.  But I pray that you will think of homeschooling <br/>\nas a touchstone -- as a way of telling what the two parties, and the <br/>\ntwo Presidential nominees, stand for.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours,<br/>\n<br/>\nTony Esolen<br/>\nState Coordinator, Rhode Island Guild of Home Teachers</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13144,"nextTopicId":13073}}
