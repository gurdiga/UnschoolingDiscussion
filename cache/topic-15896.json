That&#39;s all shopping center now. And the bushes by the<br/>\nfreeway were bulldozed. But you can still pick wonderful berries at the<br/>\nNature Center (formerly Snake Lake) near S 19th and Tyler. (this is in<br/>\nTacoma WA for those who wonder) Of course, if I let my neighbor&#39;s berries<br/>\ngrow over my fence I have them in my own backyard. And in some places, wild<br/>\nstrawberries still pop up. Huckleberries, too. :) (my fav are blueberries,<br/>\nthough)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd didn&#39;t Tom Robbins write some story about a Seattle of the future<br/>\nwhere blackberry vines have overtaken just about everything?<br/>\n<br/>\n**Now this I can believe.
