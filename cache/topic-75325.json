I don&#39;t even know<br/>\n how to get a midwife plus I&#39;ve heard horror stories about forced caesareans (I<br/>\n want a VBAC) and forced vaccinations and circumcision. I&#39;m tempted to fly home<br/>\n where its all familiar!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, now Shyrley...we ARE a free country. You honestly don&#39;t think the people at this list would put up with forced anything do you?!!! :)<br/>\nI&#39;ve given birth at home, I&#39;ve had three hospital births and nothing happened in the hospital that I did not allow to happen. It was a choice to be there, so I had accepted that a certain amount of monitoring would be required, other than that, I was in control of my birth. Choosing a good hospital would be necessary of course. <br/>\nOr finding a lay midwife if you are going to have a home birth.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re considered higher risk and a midwife won&#39;t take you, you could always seek out a nurse midwife, which makes a hospital birth much more empowering.<br/>\nNo one can vaccinate your baby or circumsize them without your consent. Keep your baby with you and they won&#39;t have any choice about it! I never had any problems with that stuff though. And I have two totally unvaccinated kids, one that started and I stopped them, the other got the full round before I had researched it enough. :( poor guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, about the age difference....<br/>\nI have 11 years between my oldest and youngest and it&#39;s great. Sure, the legos and other small items were a worry for a while. But the kids adapted and learned to help me with that and Trevor is a fabulous babysitter, something I wouldn&#39;t have if there was less of an age gap.<br/>\nJalen loves his older siblings dearly. I think a big age gap can provide opportunities you don&#39;t get with kids closer in age. Greater maturity and less reason for conflict is a big one!!<br/>\nIt is exhausting sometimes though, that I will admit!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75304,"nextTopicId":75326}}
