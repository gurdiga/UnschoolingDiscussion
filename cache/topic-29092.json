There<br/>\nhave to be a few therapists out there who are willing to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW - When she was in school, they did a full round IEP testing on my<br/>\nyounger daughter.  It showed exactly what I knew it would but the<br/>\nprinciple of the school said, and I quote, &quot;We don&#39;t like that particular<br/>\ntest, so we are going to ignore the results of that one.&quot;  We started<br/>\nhomeschooling within 6 months and did not ignore the results of that<br/>\ntest.  She is a visual learner with a problem processing verbal<br/>\ninformation.   Knowing that helped me to know which things she would like<br/>\nto do and which she would probably not - and that was very important for<br/>\nme to know because she is the one who would go along with anything just<br/>\nbecause it is her personality.<br/>\n<br/>\n          Bridget<br/>\n                                Nollaig Shona  --  S�och�in ar domhan, <br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\nTake your life in your own hands and what happens? A terrible thing: no<br/>\none to blame.<br/>\n- Erica Jong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I&#39;m glad I ask you because I want to diffuse this misunderstanding <br/>\n&gt; immediately! I do *not* believe there is a proper age to be reading. <br/>\n&gt; My concern with dd is that she *wants* to read but struggles, etc. <br/>\n&gt; I am *not* forcing her to see a therapist but I question the wise <br/>\n&gt; women on this list about the wisdom of doing this or not. I want to <br/>\n&gt; know what others think. Personally, I prefer to steer clear of <br/>\n&gt; therapists because I didn&#39;t find them to be very helpful for my <br/>\n&gt; personal situation a long time ago. <br/>\n&gt; With regard of pushing to learn basics.... again, I don&#39;t know <br/>\n&gt; what&#39;s right to do or *not* do.  I wonder if kids need that basic <br/>\n&gt; knowledge of adding & subtracting & reading to be *able* to do all <br/>\n&gt; the other glorious things their little hearts lead them to! I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; KNOW!!! I did teach the basics with one child but not with the <br/>\n&gt; other, as stated earlier. The one that is unhappy is the one not <br/>\n&gt; taught. <br/>\n&gt; I believe this list has enough room to be open for discussion of <br/>\n&gt; variations on how to get to a comfortable level of unschooling and <br/>\n&gt; problems, ideas and support surrounding these issues.<br/>\n&gt; Sarah<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
