A mom asked <br/>\nfor advice on how to handle her DD who is getting into a lot of <br/>\ntrouble in the first grade for talking and wanting to socialize.  I, <br/>\nof course, suggested that she pull the child out of school (the mom <br/>\nactually said that she had thought about homeschooling).  Only one <br/>\nother person on the list suggested the same thing.  The following is <br/>\na response from a first grade teacher who is on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I first would encourage her to understand that she has<br/>\nto get her work done. It is her JOB right now. Also talk to her<br/>\nabout how talking to her friends keeps her and her friends from<br/>\ngetting the job done. Many times, I have found that boredom is NOT<br/>\nthe case in a situation like this.....the child just does not want to<br/>\ndo the work because they would rather waste time and talk. Many kids<br/>\ntoday are so used to having instant gratification. They don&#39;t want to<br/>\nspend time to get anything done. I am not saying that this is the<br/>\ncase with your daughter, but this is a common problem with this age.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOMG, I was starting to get really upset at this point in reading the <br/>\npost.  I&#39;m sure all of you can understand why.  :)  The I read the <br/>\nnext paragraph.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Homeschooling would give your daughter the attention that she needs.<br/>\nI am hoping to get our bills down to a point that I only have to <br/>\nwork part time or even better, stay at home because I don&#39;t want my <br/>\nlittle ones going to public school. The teachers are great, but the <br/>\nsystem has many problems, the teachers are losing control of the <br/>\nclassroom because of programs and paperwork being forced upon us. In <br/>\nthe past 8 years of teaching, it has changed so much. I am looking <br/>\nfor another position within the district that is technology based or <br/>\nI will be looking again at charter schools.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm....if a teacher (who teaches in your district) is telling you to <br/>\nhome school, don&#39;t you think that you should?<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90511,"nextTopicId":90590}}
