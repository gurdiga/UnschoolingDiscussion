Dr. Anderson is a local medical doctor who has  studied<br/>\nthe creation science issue for over 30 years. He is very  knowledgeable in<br/>\nthe area of the origin of the races and genetics. This past  week two<br/>\n13-year old home schoolers called it. They did a GREAT job! On  Tuesday,<br/>\nNov. 30, Dr. Stuart Patterson, professor emeritus and chairman of  the<br/>\nchemistry department at Furman University, will be the featured  guest.<br/>\nDrs. Anderson and Patterson are both young Earth creationists and  members<br/>\nof the Creation Study Group board.

Dr. Cobin has his Ph.D. in public policy from<br/>\nGeorge Mason  University and studied under Dr. Walter Williams who is a<br/>\nfrequent guest host  on the Rush Limbaugh Show with over 20 million<br/>\nlisteners per week. If you  have already listened to their show, you know<br/>\nhow informative it is. It truly  challenges your thinking. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis one-hour segment each morning is  informative and thought-provoking.<br/>\nThey often deal with the issue of  creation, since Biblical creation is<br/>\nthe foundation of a truly Biblical world  and life view.  Turn the radio<br/>\non while you are eating breakfast with  the children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have already been listening, let the radio station  know you<br/>\nappreciate the program. If we are to keep this genre of  high-quality,<br/>\nBible-based, strongly apologetic programming on the air, they  need to<br/>\nhear from you.
