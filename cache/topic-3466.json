Don&#39;t really remember when or how I found out he didn&#39;t really come. My dad even had a friend dress up and come to our house and my mom woke me up and we even got a picture of &quot;Santa.&quot; Years later, after all grown up, whenever I saw that guy, I called him Santa! Never remember me finding out the truth as being something negative.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo naturally when my first was born, we did the whole Santa thing too. Of course she was so different than I was and questioned everything. So at the time, the only thing I knew to do was answer her questions while still keeping the magic of the man. Well her questions were incredible and I made up elaborate stories to cover. It wasn&#39;t until Tara was almost 13 that we all realized she still thought there was a Santa. She wasn&#39;t mad at me or anything but still remembers how she felt when she found out. It really was an accident as we all just thought she knew the truth by that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when second child came along, I was adamant about not lying and doing the whole Santa thing. My husband wasn&#39;t happy but I insisted. We didn&#39;t say there wasn&#39;t a Santa, just never said there was. Somewhere along the way when Joseph was about 4, he started the whole Santa thing himself. Of course his year younger sister went along with whatever he believed. By that time I was smarter and asked them what they thought. I let them figure out what they wanted to believe. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo now at almost 10, 9 and 4, the 3 little ones believe there is a Santa. Not to the extent where it consumes them like it did my first child though. Any questions are answered by them once we talk about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSanta fills stockings for them and brings one gift for each left under the tree not wrapped. He also brings one thing for all 3 younger children to share. Like last year it was the Toss Across game. Santa doesn&#39;t do adults which means not our oldest then either. Kids just kind of said he only does little ones. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo even though I tried to not do Santa, the kids seem to want to believe in a certain degree of him. At the same time, they also know people dress up like Santa just to play fun. I figure with them, they will eventually come up with other answers on their own. This way it&#39;s much more comfortable for me than the first go around and I think it&#39;s healthier for my kids too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78615010,"authorName":"mamaaj2000","from":"&quot;mamaaj2000&quot; &lt;mamaaj2000@...&gt;","profile":"mamaaj2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Santa","postDate":"1090514729","msgId":96662,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNkb3F2OSt0bW5wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzIyMTU0NzIyLjMyMDAwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjgxNDAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":96660,"nextInTopic":96664,"prevInTime":96661,"nextInTime":96663,"topicId":3466,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Goggle candy coal and you ll find similar things like this: http://www.candywarehouse.com/coalcan7lbbo.html A couple people tried to tell Mikey last year","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1960391200\">Goggle &#39;candy coal&#39; and you&#39;ll find similar things like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.candywarehouse.com/coalcan7lbbo.html\">http://www.candywarehouse.com/coalcan7lbbo.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nA couple people tried to tell Mikey last year that he&#39;d better be <br/>\ngood...and of course, there&#39;s a song about it!

I love Santa!  I still remember when I found out he was fantasy.<br/>\nI was in third grade and the kids went around the table asking if you<br/>\nbelieved in Santa.  No one said yes, and I didn&#39;t either.  But that was the<br/>\nfirst time I questioned it.  I asked my mother and she said that if I didn&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve, he wouldn&#39;t come.  I&#39;ve believed ever since.  ;0)  I didn&#39;t feel<br/>\nbetrayed by my mother at all, though. <br/>\n <br/>\nThen one day I was talking with a cousin who also homeschools her children<br/>\nand she said she told her kids from the start that Santa wasn&#39;t real.  At<br/>\nfirst I thought it was awful for her to ruin the fantasy part of Christmas<br/>\nbut after giving it some thought I started to feel bad that I had lied to my<br/>\nchildren about this, but been very honest with them in all other regards.<br/>\nThe reason she told her kids from the start that Santa was fantasy is<br/>\nbecause she felt like she was the last one to learn the truth and she felt<br/>\nher mother had lied to her.  She lived next to the school and one day in 5th<br/>\ngrade all the kids were saying that Santa wasn&#39;t real.  She went home and<br/>\nasked her mother and her mother didn&#39;t tell her the truth and she went back<br/>\nto school and argued it with the kids.  In the end she ended up feeling<br/>\nstupid and lied to.   (If my kids asked, I would either tell them the truth,<br/>\nthough.)<br/>\n <br/>\nOver the years it has seemed like I&#39;ve had to keep lying and changing the<br/>\nlies to keep it under wraps.  (or sometimes I just say I don&#39;t know...this<br/>\nis what happened when I was little.)  Over the last few years I&#39;ve tried not<br/>\nto lie outright about Santa but put it a little differently......&quot;we&#39;d<br/>\nbetter get to bed, *they say* Santa only comes when you are fast asleep.&quot;<br/>\n(kind of like Sandra mentioned.)  <br/>\n <br/>\nFrom the time the kids were small we had gifts from Santa and gifts from us.<br/>\nSanta fills the stockings and leaves a few small gifts and the rest is from<br/>\nus.  I can&#39;t really change that now but it has always been confusing for me<br/>\nbecause I can never remember what gifts were from Santa and what were from<br/>\nus, after the fact.  So two months later when a mom asks me where we got<br/>\nsomething, I&#39;m likely to say enthusiastically, oh, I got that on ebay for<br/>\nonly $5, to which my children pipe up...&quot;no you didn&#39;t, we got that from<br/>\nSanta!&quot; Agh!!!

Obviously, she doesn&#39;t<br/>\ngo to school so she won&#39;t be questioned there.  She has one very close<br/>\nfriend who also believes.  She also plays with cousins somewhat regularly<br/>\nbut I am not sure if they would talk about that.  Will she ever learn the<br/>\ntruth or will I have to sneak into her house when she is grown up to deliver<br/>\npresents to her kids?  LOL!  She is very analytical so part of me wonders if<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t figure it out years ago and just wants to believe so badly that<br/>\nshe&#39;s willing to overlook the inconsistencies.  If she asks for the truth I<br/>\nwill certainly tell her but until both my girls know I think I will feel a<br/>\nlittle unease somewhere in the back of my mind about it.  I wish I&#39;d been a<br/>\nlittle more mysterious about it instead of seeming like I had the facts when<br/>\nthey were smaller.  I did tell them that the santas in stores are not the<br/>\nreal Santa....but that feels like a lie too, for goodness sakes.  (it<br/>\nindicates that there is a *real* Santa.)  <br/>\n <br/>\nI love z&quot;Yes Virginia, There is a Santa Claus&quot; and I&#39;ve always thought I&#39;d<br/>\nread that to the kids when they question me.

We ended up just not making a big deal out of it<br/>\nourselves and the Grandmas have sent presents from Santa.  Last year I got<br/>\nhim to agree to do one each for the kids and I was like - &#39;Look! these are<br/>\nfrom Santa!&#39; and Harriet was looking at me like, &#39;yeah, and?&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nSigh.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been thinking lately. Of course this comes after I already<br/>\n&gt; had my daughter believing in Santa Claus.

I&#39;m feeling pretty guilty that I&#39;ve constructed this false<br/>\n&gt; character for my daughter.

I do not think that sharing the tradition of Santa Claus with a child is a destructive thing.  It depends upon how it is shared, and how the child learns the true nature of Santa when they are old enough to grasp the abstract concept of the spirit of giving.  Is a it a secret deception that the child &quot;finds out&quot; and feels betrayed about?  Or is it a special sharing between parent and child that reinforces the message behind the fantasy and brings the child lovingly into the circle of giver, as well as reciever?  It only becomes a lie if you believe you are lying.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you believe everything that you tell your child about it, you are not lying.  It is believeing in intangibles, in the energy created by the belief of so many people around the world that makes a thing real.  If I tell my child &quot;I believe in Santa&quot; that is true.  I don&#39;t tell my children that Santa lives in the North Pole, but if I say that &quot;Santa can be everywhere that he is believed in&quot;  that is true and what I believe, and also &quot;Santa comes to the homes of everyone who believes in him, everywhere, during the holidays&quot; because Santa is in all our hearts as an embodiment of our holiday spirit, and comes into our homes as he comes into our hearts.
