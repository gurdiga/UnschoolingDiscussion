Watch them with your children.  Cook<br/>\ninteresting meals together.  Keep current on community happenings.  Attend<br/>\nthem with your family.  You know, the festivals, special exhibits at<br/>\nmuseums, fairs, and other events.  Go camping together.  Walk along the<br/>\nbeach on a starry night.  Volunteer with your children at the local public<br/>\nlibrary.  Play basketball together at a community park.  Plant a garden.<br/>\nMake your living room into a mini Legoland.  Take a hike through a forest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list is endless really.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see there are tons of things to do before you buckle down and<br/>\n&quot;start learning&quot; again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the Andersen household, we&#39;ve gotten so hooked on &quot;play,&quot; that we&#39;ve all<br/>\nbut thrown &quot;learning&quot; out the window.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Andersen<br/>\nUnconventional Ideas at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://unconventional.go.to\">http://unconventional.go.to</a><br/>\n&quot;Possessions&quot;--Is the drive to own things a natural human instinct, or the<br/>\nresult of cultural conditioning?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.themestream.com/gspd_browse/browse/view_article.gsp?c_id=45964\">http://www.themestream.com/gspd_browse/browse/view_article.gsp?c_id=45964</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Ruth MacAlister wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello, everyone!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; New to homeschooling, my family and I are slowly adjusting.

We made the decision to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; homeschool because of concerns about social issues in the schools, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; also because we just didn&#39;t feel the girls were getting what they need.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; They are both very bright, and often complained about the boredom they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; experienced in the classroom. Since bringing them home, we have found<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that they have really lost their natural curiosity.  It seems public<br/>\n&gt; &gt; school has drummed it right out of them! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13378,"nextTopicId":13385}}
