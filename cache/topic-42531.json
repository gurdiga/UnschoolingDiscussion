Near my house, Pete Tavita Solomona, 47, was arrested <br/>\non Oct. 18, for the fatal shooting of Brandon Ketsdever, a 17-year-old. <br/>\nBrandon and some friends had, as a prank, swiped a plastic Halloween <br/>\ndecoration from Solomona&#39;s front yard. Solomona&#39;s defense was that he was <br/>\njust threatening the boys when he held the gun up to Brandon&#39;s head and that <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t mean to pull the trigger of his 357 magnum. <br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42551,"nextTopicId":42555}}
