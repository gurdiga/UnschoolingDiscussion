Did they not get answered? Perhaps some of <br/>\n  the other members of this list *were* learning something from the phonics <br/>\n  discussion, disagreements and all. You&#39;ll get more from any list the more <br/>\n  you participate.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;........i wnat to echange ideas.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Okay, so let&#39;s start exchanging ideas. What&#39;s going on in your unschooling <br/>\n  home today Denise?<br/>\n<br/>\n  In my home Conor spent much of the day learning about spelling. But don&#39;t <br/>\n  tell him that. He thinks he was just typing in commands, and chatting with <br/>\n  other gamers during an online game. He had many spelling questions that came <br/>\n  up though, so I made sure I was right there to help.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Casey decided she wanted to earn every try-it badge that she hadn&#39;t already <br/>\n  earned in her Brownie book. She and I have worked through 14 badges between <br/>\n  yesterday and today. We also all visited the Park City Art Fest and finished <br/>\n  reading Artemis Fowl together. After I finish this, I&#39;m off to try and get <br/>\n  some child-sized help in cleaning some very stinky animal cages.  &lt;PU&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;yes i have abandonment issues.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not sure how this relates to this list. No one is going to abandon you <br/>\n  or tell you to leave. But if you come to an unschooling list, this one in <br/>\n  particular, unschooling and all its nuances will be discussed. It&#39;s not to <br/>\n  insult or degrade or embarrass any one poster. It&#39;s a discussion meant to <br/>\n  enlighten us all.
