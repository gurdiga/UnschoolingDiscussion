Filing a Private School Affidavit (R4 Form) for exemption as a Private School. (E.C. 33190 & 48222)<br/>\nThe least restrictive method for homeschooling is to teach your children without being involved with a school district or any form of government schooling. You can establish your own private school in your home. In California, private school teachers are not required to have teaching credentials. Once you establish your private school you must file a Private School Affidavit with the CA Department of Education between October 1st and 15th annually. As a private school, you are required to maintain certain records (see list below) and must comply with the CA Education Codes that pertain to private schools. Again, Private School Affidavits must be filed annually between October 1st and 15th.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homefires.com/castyle.html\">http://www.homefires.com/castyle.html</a> (info above from this site, they have a bunch more info too)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/regional/CaliforniaR4.htm\">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/regional/CaliforniaR4.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Maureen Jones&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:o_byrnes@...\">o_byrnes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tue, 19 Oct 2004 22:36:17 +0000<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingdiscussion-owner@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingdiscussion-owner@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying to get some info on  &quot;unschooling.&quot;  I am 60 years old and have<br/>\na daughter who just turned 8 and would be in 3rd grade in public school.<br/>\nBecause I believe strongly that our world is so different now I believe that<br/>\nchildren no longer benefit from the public school&#39;s antiquated values and<br/>\nteaching methods.
