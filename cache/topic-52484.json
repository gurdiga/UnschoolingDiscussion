Together with the water and<br/>\nthe sugar, bring it to a boil in a pot, let sit for 20 minutes.<br/>\nTake out the tea filter, add the red wine and heat. The art is<br/>\nto heat the wine up as close to its boiling temperature without<br/>\never getting it to boil (the most important thing about making<br/>\ngluehwein is that the wine must NEVER boil). Finally, add lemon<br/>\njuice to taste.<br/>\n<br/>\n Possible variations: ~ leave away the lemon juice or use orange<br/>\njuice instead ~ leave away the lemon peel ~ instead of boiling<br/>\nthe tea filter, put it directly into the wine, heat, and let<br/>\nsoak for 30 - 45 minutes (you don&#39;t need the water this way);<br/>\nif you chop up the ingredients before putting them in the filter,<br/>\nyou get a more intensive flavor ~ add a few drops of vanilla<br/>\n~ add a little cardamom and/or ginger ~ vary the quantities of<br/>\ncinnamon, cloves and sugar ~ to get the possibly most famous<br/>\ntype of gluehwein, the Nuernberger Christkindlesmarkt-Gluehwein,<br/>\nuse blueberry wine instead of red wine <br/>\n Typed for you by Volkhart Baumgaertner<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGluehwein  <br/>\n <br/>\n  <br/>\nYield: 8 servings<br/>\n<br/>\n32 oz dry red wine<br/>\n1/4 c orange juice<br/>\n2 tb lemon juice<br/>\nspiral orange peel<br/>\nstick cinnamon<br/>\n4 cloves<br/>\n8 tb sugar<br/>\n1/3 c rum<br/>\n<br/>\nCombine wine, juice, peel, cinnamon, cloves and 4 Tbl sugar in<br/>\nsaucepan.
