I have an 11yo son who is very eager to<br/>\nlearn game programming and has sifted through a lot of internet research to<br/>\nfind stuff out. I am really thrilled to see him on his own so eager and<br/>\ncapable to find tid-bits of this and that, but I would love to help support<br/>\nthis interest and help him find a good beginner book (there just doesn&#39;t<br/>\nseem to be anything written for a beginner at his level of understanding).<br/>\nDoes anyone know of good sources of info on game programming? In my research<br/>\nit seems like there is a ton of different languages that different games<br/>\nuse. What is a good one to start with?<br/>\nAlso, I think it would be a great thing to get the kids that are all<br/>\ninterested in this to start being pen-pals. They could help each other out<br/>\nby sharing the bit and pieces that they know with each other and have<br/>\nsomeone to share their excitement with.<br/>\nYou can e-mail me personally if this sounds good to you. It is really<br/>\nexciting to me to have kids learn from each other and often it works out<br/>\nreally good because they can explain things in their &quot;language&quot;.<br/>\n~Steph<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103441,"nextTopicId":103556}}
