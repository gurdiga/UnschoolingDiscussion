I&#39;ve had similar reactions over loose <br/>\nteeth.  I know, its just a little tooth, it will come on out it own, etc etc <br/>\netc.. And, I HAVE gotten much much better with each child.  I&#39;m thinking back to <br/>\nwhen Landon and Anna lost thier baby teeth and I obsessed over it so much.

You see the kid being <br/>\nbothered by it and you think,  oh, just let me get ahold of it.. come on, it <br/>\nwill only take a second...  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way I got over being annoyed by a hanging on tooth was to just try <br/>\nto ignore it.    I would keep telling myself, it will fall out, it will just <br/>\nfall out.. be patient.   And, I would often remind myself that the tooth was <br/>\nbothering ME a lot more than it was the kid.   Now, IF and WHEN the kid wanted <br/>\nthe tooth out, if they asked me to help them get it out, I found a great way to <br/>\npull teeth.  Get a dry hand towel, cover your hand with it and then get ahold <br/>\nof the tooth.    The kid has so much towel in his mouth, and they can hardly <br/>\nfeel you getting the tooth.  When the tooth is so loose its just hanging there, <br/>\nall you really have to do is get a grip on it.with the towel and it comes <br/>\nout.  And the towel soaks up any blood or slobber.   Usually my kids don&#39;t even <br/>\nknow I have pulled the tooth.  They actually liked this method so much that <br/>\nsometimes they asked me to pull thier tooth when it got really loose.    But, my <br/>\nkids have lost many more &quot;on thier own&quot; by biting an apple, jumping on the <br/>\ntrampoline, wrestling with thier siblings, .. that loose tooth would just fall <br/>\nout in the normal process of living and playing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: chosing battles","postDate":"1055310865","msgId":73647,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJjNmc2aCtmZDdyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMGIwMWMzMmZkNSRlYzk5MTIyMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":73639,"nextInTopic":73668,"prevInTime":73646,"nextInTime":73648,"topicId":73639,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Don t be so hard on yourself!

Some of you may remember awhile ago me talking about how she would sometimes cry and get so worked up over what seemed like nothing to the rest of us. She would really lose it. Well some of you here helped me try and understand what it must be like for her and we have thankfully ended those crying jags and overwhelmed moments. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s still very sensitive about certain things, especially when it comes to any kind of injury or the slightest bit of discomfort. We work with that and are also doing well.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow here&#39;s the me being a poop part. She has this tooth, front upper tooth that is very loose. She has lost 2 bottom and the other front tooth, latest one just like last week. I actually pulled it for her. It takes her awhile to want it out. I have been patient, never pull unless she says to do it and I let her know I will try. I try once and if she says no more, than no more. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast week, after the first top tooth came out, the next one seemed even looser than that one. I tried to get it out, it was in there much more than I expected and she decided not to try again. (she doesn&#39;t want to ge them out herself) So far everything okay. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis tooth is still hanging there. I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s still there. She can&#39;t eat right, talk right or brush her teeth right. The permanent tooth is already in behind it. I don&#39;t know what it is about this situation that has me so anal. She doesn&#39;t want this tooth out. No big deal, it&#39;s bound to come out eventually. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is why I&#39;m so darn anal about this that I can&#39;t let it go and leave her alone. It&#39;s a stupid little tooth!!!
