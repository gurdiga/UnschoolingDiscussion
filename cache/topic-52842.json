Homeschooling procedures are based on<br/>\nthe judges&#39; rulings on two cases: &quot;Charles&quot; and &quot;Brunelle&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are bits that are open to interpretation, and, as in most states,<br/>\nthere are superintendents that ask more than the (case) law permits. But<br/>\noverall the language emphasizes parental rights over state rights and the<br/>\nneed for the state to *prove* -- not just say -- that what the parents<br/>\npropose is inadequate before refusing to grant approval to homeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe requirements don&#39;t interfere with unschooling. We have to send in an Ed<br/>\nplan. (I use Carol Narigon&#39;s.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html)\">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html)</a> And then superintendents<br/>\ncan ask for a form of evaluation that is agreeable with the parents. I send<br/>\nin a few sentences indicating progress in each subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s clear that the Bryants could argue that the state doesn&#39;t have any<br/>\nlegal right to ask anything if there are no laws. (And apparently their<br/>\nstance was the only laws binding are the state constitution.) But if what<br/>\nthe state asks isn&#39;t burdensome then fighting against it becomes, in my mind<br/>\nand in the minds of many MA homeschoolers, a matter of legal principle<br/>\nrather than homeschooling principle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And that even after the case was dismissed at some point the school<br/>\n&gt; superintendent continued the harrassment?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My understanding -- and it could be off (since the case was long, drawn out<br/>\nand frankly boring) but seems to jive with others&#39; understandings -- is that<br/>\nthe school board asked for an ed plan and the Bryants refused claiming the<br/>\nboard had no right to ask. It gets a bit gray on who to believe after that.<br/>\nThere was some legal wrangling over a couple of years and the Bryants said<br/>\nthey submitted a plan and the board said they either didn&#39;t or that it was<br/>\ninadequate. Since it stretched over a few years the Bryants obviously owed a<br/>\nnumber of ed plans and if they were submitting a plan that was asked for 2<br/>\nyears previous and not for the current year then they can say they submitted<br/>\na plan and the school board can both say they didn&#39;t and that it was<br/>\ninadequate. I don&#39;t know that that is what happened but it&#39;s plausible<br/>\nbecause it should be so simple for the Bryants to come out publicly and<br/>\npresent what they submitted and when to show how unreasonable the town was<br/>\nbeing. But they never did. It was just a bunch of &quot;Yes we did&quot;s and &quot;No they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t&quot;s. The Bryants were eventually taken to court and they lost. They<br/>\nappealed. They lost again. And DSS got involved and the children came under<br/>\nstate protection but remained in the custody of their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were obviously things going on that those outside the case don&#39;t have<br/>\nknowledge of that were affecting the decisions being made and what was being<br/>\nsaid. All I know is that throughout the whole mess the Bryants weren&#39;t<br/>\nnearly as clear about what they had done and the timing of it as they were<br/>\nabout their claims that the school board was harassing them and about their<br/>\nstance on the state constitutuion and legal issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just being skeptical. There isn&#39;t enough information to say who is right<br/>\nand who is wrong. But what little information there is -- especially since<br/>\nit&#39;s mostly the Bryants version of what was going on -- doesn&#39;t add up<br/>\nclearly to a homeschooling family being wronged by the school board. There<br/>\nmay be things that would explain why it looks that way. But the information<br/>\njust isn&#39;t there.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129256077,"authorName":"bluelotus","from":"bluelotus &lt;bluelotus@...&gt;","profile":"yolswandass","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: the Bryant family case","postDate":"1041355576","msgId":52870,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFMTFEMzM4LjYwNTAxMDNAYXR0Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwNDEzMzk4NTIuMzQ5LjI4NDc4Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":52868,"nextInTopic":52891,"prevInTime":52869,"nextInTime":52871,"topicId":52842,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"But wasn t the main issue that the school had no authority whatsoever to ask them for certain procedures to homeschool (because there was no regulation on","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2065878808\">But wasn&#39;t the main issue that the school had no authority whatsoever to <br/>\nask them for &quot;certain procedures&quot; to homeschool (because there was no <br/>\nregulation on hsing in MA and nowhere was to be found that the school <br/>\nhad legal rights to ask for them)?<br/>\nAnd that even after the case was dismissed at some point the school <br/>\nsuperintendent continued the harrassment?<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand what you&#39;re saying but it seems to me that in this case the <br/>\ncourt was giving the school comittee total control over hsing with no <br/>\nlegal ground.
