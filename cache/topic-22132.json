I had a nice talk with Ryan this<br/>\nmorning before school about what her goals are. They<br/>\nare in this order, be in a Symphony Orchestra, and be<br/>\na wife and mom.

In my Junior year, I worked <br/>\nout an agreement with the University of Oregon to admit me without my <br/>\nhigh school diploma OR a GED. I took the SAT tests a year early, and <br/>\non the strength of my SAT scores I got in. With the help of a good <br/>\nguidance counselor in my high school, I arranged with my high school <br/>\nto get high school credits for my college classes and so I graduated <br/>\nhigh school after my first year of college, going through graduation <br/>\nwith my regular class. I still remember the discussion I had with my <br/>\nhigh school principle when the counselor and I presented my plan to <br/>\nhim. He was very concerned about me missing out on &quot;your senior year, <br/>\nthe best year of your life&quot;. Bwahahahahahahaha<br/>\nInterestingly enough, I just found some really bad poetry I wrote <br/>\nduring that last semester of public school, including the following <br/>\n(pithy, but poignant) segment: <br/>\n<br/>\nSee the happy teens<br/>\ngoing to their school<br/>\nsee them go to classes that<br/>\nturn them into mindless fools<br/>\nsee them, aren&#39;t the happy<br/>\nthey wouldn&#39;t want to die<br/>\nmaybe they can tell you<br/>\nwhy the suicide rate&#39;s so high<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the principle only knew! I was sooooo happy to escape. I guess an <br/>\nunschooler was born... I found out later that the only reason he <br/>\nwanted me to stay is that I was supposed to be a National Merit <br/>\nScholar, but I wouldn&#39;t qualify if I didn&#39;t stay in *his* school. I <br/>\nwas going to make his statistics look worse, so he didn&#39;t want me to <br/>\ngo. Bleh.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another track, my DH was basically failing school and also hated <br/>\nit. He left about the same time I did, but &quot;dropped out&quot;. Then <br/>\nsomeone convinced him to go through a local community college and he <br/>\ntook classes there and then got his GED. That&#39;s another route to <br/>\ntake.

My dilemma is this: dd Ryan, 6th grade, is<br/>\n&gt; an exceptionally bright person and very social. This<br/>\n&gt; means she is not &quot;performing&quot; well in school. I just<br/>\n&gt; got a phone call from one of her teachers(very nice<br/>\n&gt; lady, by the way) letting me know that she only has a<br/>\n&gt; 29% in civics and a 41% in writers workshop because<br/>\n&gt; she hasn&#39;t been turning in her assignments.

Dh and I<br/>\nhave chosen to homeschool/unschool our 9yo and 16mo<br/>\nds&#39;s. That choice lets you know my basic philosophy on<br/>\neducation. My dilemma is this: dd Ryan, 6th grade, is<br/>\nan exceptionally bright person and very social. This<br/>\nmeans she is not &quot;performing&quot; well in school. I just<br/>\ngot a phone call from one of her teachers(very nice<br/>\nlady, by the way) letting me know that she only has a<br/>\n29% in civics and a 41% in writers workshop because<br/>\nshe hasn&#39;t been turning in her assignments. This is<br/>\nthe norm for Ryan, she loses things or forgets to turn<br/>\nthem in, or doesn&#39;t feel like doing them. The funny<br/>\nthing is these are two of her favorite classes.<br/>\nAnyway, I guess my question is how do I help Ryan<br/>\n&quot;succeed&quot; in public school when I don&#39;t agree with the<br/>\nsystem, and homschooling is not an option? I should<br/>\nalso mention that as far as public schools go, this is<br/>\nthe best our district has to offer, and I know her<br/>\nteachers quite well. Any help would be much<br/>\nappreciated, thanks!:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nLaura, blessed to be the mommy of<br/>\nJenny 11/6/85<br/>\nShaw 5/22/87<br/>\nRyan 7/9/89<br/>\nNoah 3/9/92<br/>\nAidan 1/24/00<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
