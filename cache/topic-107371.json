One of the ways I have dealt with it, and pretty much continue to<br/>\ndeal with it, is not to do school or even school bashing conversations.

The point for me was<br/>\nthat attempting to argue or persuade only made me feel distraught (too much<br/>\nbaggage) and overly critical of her ignorance. I was engaging in self care<br/>\nby not allowing someone with a history of dripping tiny slips of poison into<br/>\nmy brain and heart to even begin. <br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore one of my suggestions is to try to keep most of these<br/>\nconversations to the phone so that they are simple to end on your terms,<br/>\neven if it&#39;s along the lines of &quot;Oh Deon needs my help, gotta go&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother suggestion is not to let these folk get past the first question,<br/>\n&quot;What is she learning?&quot; Immediately jump in with some of her latest<br/>\nactivities focusing on her enjoyment of them with long winded enthusiasm.<br/>\nPersonally I don&#39;t find it tough to rave about Jayn, and only restrain<br/>\nmyself amongst other parents because I don&#39;t want to bore everyone else who<br/>\nis likely equally besotted with their own kids.

My name is Jenn and I am <br/>\na single parent with two children; DD, Madison,  who will be 11 next <br/>\nmonth and DS, Deon,  who is 4. I have been lurking on this list for some <br/>\ntime but there has been a period of time where I wasn&#39;t following the <br/>\nposts so if my questions have been asked before I apologize.<br/>\n<br/>\nI withdrew my DD from school this past March after being fed up with the <br/>\nway 5th grade (and her entire academic career in general) was <br/>\nprogressing. She started lying around October about her homework <br/>\nassignments, saying she didn&#39;t have any most nights. Her teacher called <br/>\nme in November and I discovered she gave homework every night. From that <br/>\npoint on I learned that Madison did not care about school. I was raised <br/>\nin a family where my own mother overcompensated. Her mother (my Nana) <br/>\nwas very strict: beatings, screaming, strict rules, very strict <br/>\nupbringing, Catholic school. My mom being the oldest of 5 rebelled at an <br/>\nearly age and I guess figured she would do the opposite with her own <br/>\nchildren. The result was just as disastrous, in my opinion, as I was <br/>\ngiven no responsibility, no encouragement and therefore, no value.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther discussions with Madison made me realize I needed to homeschool, <br/>\nwhich was something I was researching anyway. Speaking to other <br/>\nhomeschoolers I learned about unschooling. Madison brightened at the <br/>\nidea of not having to open another text book again. It hadn&#39;t dawned on <br/>\nme, prior to this, that school had squashed the curious little learner <br/>\nwho asked countless questions as a toddler. She started pre-school at <br/>\nthe age of 4, while I went to school and eventually began working <br/>\nfull-time. She never loved elementary school. She preferred the times in <br/>\npre-school and kindegarten when she was allowed to play, color and have <br/>\nfun with her classmates. So we have spent the last 5 months doing <br/>\n&quot;nothing&quot; (not really nothing but it would look that way to others) and <br/>\nin the beginning I was nervous. I believe in the approach to unschooling <br/>\nbut my faith is a bit shaky because we are so new to this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always been a strict parent, trying to approach a level of <br/>\ndiscipline some where between my mother and Nana, but ways that I am not <br/>\nproud of have seeped in, such as yelling. I am working hard to control <br/>\nthat, knowing it has nothing to do with the child but my own <br/>\nfrustrations or impatience. I, of course, explain this to them but that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean anything to a poor child who has been yelled at. I have <br/>\nmade great strides recently so I am proud of my own learning. So in the <br/>\nmidst of our adjusting to a new way of life, I &#39;ve had to deal with some <br/>\nfamily members (actually two, my mother and aunt) who ask endless <br/>\nquestions and although I explained unschooling in the beginning, I gave <br/>\nup and am now just &quot;agreeing&quot; with what they say, or lying to them. For <br/>\ninstance, &quot;How do you know she is learning anything?&quot; &quot;I ask her <br/>\nquestions.&quot; I don&#39;t want to lie but felt I needed to not have the <br/>\nemotional interference until I could stand on my own two feet and <br/>\nproudly declare, &quot;We are a unschooling family and it is best for us.&quot; <br/>\nOther questions I hear are, &quot;What is she learning? How do you know what <br/>\nsubjects to teach? How will you teach Chemistry or Algebra? You need to <br/>\nteach spelling, writing, grammar. Tape a multiplication chart to her <br/>\nwall so she can look at it.&quot; Here, that will help her learn math. <br/>\nEventually she won&#39;t even see it anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother&#39;s questions are easier. She is most likely to one day <br/>\nunderstand but my aunt, who is a psychologist and works in the public <br/>\nschool system, is another story. My daughter is overweight and she does <br/>\nnot agree with my allowing the kids to eat what they want, when they are <br/>\nhungry. She believes that a child can&#39;t get what they need nutritionally <br/>\nbecause they are too young to make &quot;informed decisions&quot;. I know that is <br/>\nbull.  So sorry, this got so long.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I need are some responses for family&#39;s questions that will shut <br/>\nthem up without being rude. :) I am thankful to have found this group <br/>\nand hope to become involved.<br/>\nThank you for listening,<br/>\nJenn :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107363,"nextTopicId":107394}}
