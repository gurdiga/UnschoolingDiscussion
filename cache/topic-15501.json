It does <br/>\nnot have a thing to do with unschooling. The only reason I mentioned raising <br/>\ndogs to start with is because it is what my kids are interested in and the <br/>\ndog&#39;s care has a big impact on our day. I could have used bmx racing and my <br/>\nkids devotion to that, guess I did not think that the dog raising would raise <br/>\na problem. It was not the point of my post. I did not wish to start a <br/>\ndiscussion on the welfare of animals or on my family.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to unschooling ...<br/>\npeace and grace<br/>\nCandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15500,"nextTopicId":15503}}
