It surprised me, but it was  true.  <br/>\nShe wasn&#39;t a really little kid, either.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn case you&#39;re not following the links people are providing, here&#39;s what  <br/>\nthat says:<br/>\n <br/>\n  <br/>\nAdvantages Discovered from Later Reading<br/>\n[Holly Dodd read  late, and though it was frustrating a time or two, she read <br/>\nwhen she read.  Before then, there were instances when it showed an <br/>\nadvantageous side.]   <br/>\n____________________________________<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen Holly was nine she was in a play, and she wasn&#39;t reading yet. She was  <br/>\nafraid she would not know her lines, so every day she got me to read through <br/>\nher  scene, and she paid careful attention at rehearsals, and rehearsed with <br/>\nanother  family&#39;s kids. As it turned out, her inability to read along during <br/>\nrehearsals  ended up being a boon. The following was posted on  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> in April 2003:  <br/>\n&lt;&lt; If the homeschooler&#39;s theater has its performance set for May 10,  and <br/>\nfirst rehearsal is April 1, an unschooler can see that it would be best to  know <br/>\ntheir lines by then. &gt;&gt;  <br/>\nOh right! That&#39;s an example I forgot to give. Holly was in a play, put on by  <br/>\nthe city&#39;s theatre, but an all-homeschoolers&#39; session with daytime <br/>\nrehearsals.  <br/>\nHolly learned all her lines early, since she couldn&#39;t read and needed help.  <br/>\nAs rehearsals went on, she learned everyone else&#39;s lines too. Since they were  <br/>\nleaning on being able to read from scripts during rehearsals, they weren&#39;t  <br/>\nmemorizing their lines.  <br/>\nWhen the performance came two of the three main characters were Holly and her <br/>\n best friend, who knew their lines. The third didn&#39;t know his. A couple of <br/>\ntimes  when it didn&#39;t matter, one of them said his line, and left the response <br/>\nto him.  If he didn&#39;t catch it, the other of the girls would say the response. <br/>\n(Most of  what they were doing was exposition or dialog that wasn&#39;t at all <br/>\ncharacter  specific.) If it made him mad, he didn&#39;t dare say so, because he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know his  part.  <br/>\nBut Holly was so disgusted with the others, she had no interest in the next  <br/>\nplay they offered.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s too bad. Somehow she met deadlines TOO well?  <br/>\nSandra Dodd<br/>\n2002 <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109733800,"authorName":"Latoya","from":"&quot;Latoya&quot; &lt;latoyadenise@...&gt;","profile":"latoyadenise","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Thanks for Posts to Unmotivated...","postDate":"1114114014","msgId":105527,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ0OTE0dSszcWtvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":105529,"prevInTime":105526,"nextInTime":105528,"topicId":105527,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks to everyone that posted to my question and guidance on my in law.
