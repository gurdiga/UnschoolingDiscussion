It was<br/>\na very private process, though, often she would leave the room and I&#39;d<br/>\nsee her just surrounded with a stack of picture books, figuring something<br/>\nout. When she started to write she did some of the same stuff - rather<br/>\nthan ask how to spell a word (although she did that too) she&#39;d go and get<br/>\na book or a card or comic that she knew had that word in it, and copy it<br/>\nout of there. Because she didn&#39;t read phonetically, writing phonetically<br/>\nwas very laborious for her and this was easier. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe found an older ex-school textbook reader at a thrift store when she<br/>\nwas 4 that was all short plays, and she loved that one, too (she also<br/>\nacted out the Bob books).

Lots of our <br/>\ngrandmothers had those hot water bottle things hanging near the tub.  Vinegar <br/>\nand water, or worse.

How much money was spent doing something <br/>\nthat was not healthy or productive?    So that was some bathwater worth <br/>\ndisposing of.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to the &quot;bad experience&quot; part, another story.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom has gone through two periods in her life when she wasn&#39;t drinking <br/>\nmuch.  Once was when I was in elementary and we had moved away from her <br/>\nrelatives to northern New Mexico.  The drinking gradually picked up until it <br/>\nwas bad when I was in high school.  She quit again when Kirby was a baby, <br/>\nwith AA, and stayed sober 9 years.  That was so she could regain custody of <br/>\nmy younger half-brother.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I say to other friends of mine, &quot;It&#39;s a problem that you drink so much.  <br/>\nYou should try not to do that to your family,&quot; they invariably say &quot;OH, <br/>\nSandra, this is personal with you, because your mom&#39;s an alcoholic.&quot;   Or <br/>\nthey&#39;ll say to others, &quot;You know how Sandra is about alcohol, because of her <br/>\nmom.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my mom were the only alcoholic who&#39;s ever terrorized the neighborhood, set <br/>\na house on fire, run a car into a ditch and lied about it or passed out in a <br/>\nred ant bed, then yes.  It would be a total aberration and MY personal <br/>\nproblem.  But there is a pattern, and there is a principle.  People with <br/>\nchildren should not be &quot;practicing acoholics&quot; if they can find any fortitude <br/>\nwithin them to stop.   Regardless of whether my mom had never been born or if <br/>\nshe gets on a poster for &quot;alcohol is glamorous,&quot; it causes more damage than <br/>\ngood.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when I read just &quot;because someone had a bad experience with them,&quot; it <br/>\nreminds me of that.
