And something I really struggled with <br/>\nat first because my kids were so used to me trying to &quot;teach&quot; something <br/>\n,instead of just offering, that they initially resisted. So part of this <br/>\nequation, and undoubtedly the most important one, is the issue of trust <br/>\nbetween parent and child.<br/>\nIf the child knows that you trust them and they can trust you not to push <br/>\nsomething they don&#39;t want, they will be MUCH more willing to try.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other part of this equation is something that Sandra has dubbed <br/>\n&quot;strewing&quot;. I love the picture of a parent liberally strewing a path before a <br/>\nchild, rather than following along behind prodding and poking.<br/>\nWhat does strewing consist of in this house? <br/>\nHere are a few ideas......If one of my children chooses not to check anything <br/>\nout at the library, I might just grab (without saying anything) a few books, <br/>\ncassettes or movies I think they&#39;d like....or maybe just ones that interest <br/>\nME. I leave these in obvious places at home and quite often they get picked <br/>\nup and used. I don&#39;t prod, I don&#39;t say demeaning things about they &quot;should&quot; <br/>\ncheck something out. I just make things available.<br/>\nIf it&#39;s something really interesting, I may bring it to their attention and <br/>\nleave it at that.<br/>\nSo there&#39;s one example of &quot;strewing&quot;.<br/>\nAnother is to leave interesting books you have at home, lying in an unusual <br/>\nplace where it might get noticed. The bathroom is ideal, as people are <br/>\nsometimes &quot;hanging out&#39; in there for a while. LOL<br/>\nStrewing can be casual, inviting. That&#39;s what you&#39;re doing...inviting. It may <br/>\nbe totally ignored, that&#39;s fine. It might be picked up....the point is you&#39;re <br/>\noffering.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I enjoy, is to pick up the listing of local events. I will <br/>\nperuse the paper for interesting events and activities and mention them. I <br/>\nalso give them the paper and ask them to tell me if anything catches their <br/>\neye.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think part of the key for me, is to offer the information in a respectful <br/>\nmethod...just as I would to dh. &quot;Hey, this sounds really cool, why don&#39;t we <br/>\ngo try this&quot; is a lot more inviting than &quot;you should really try this class, I <br/>\nthink you&#39;d learn a lot&quot;.<br/>\nAlthough the wording is a very individual thing, I think the idea is to <br/>\noffer, but respect a &quot;NO&quot;.....or a &quot;maybe&quot; as much as a &quot;yes&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother part of this equation in my opinion is the level of interest for the <br/>\nparent.<br/>\nIf you get excited about something, it is very likely to spill over to other <br/>\nindividuals in the house....just as their excitement hopefully gets you going.<br/>\nIf you have varied interests that you&#39;re willing to explore, this really sets <br/>\nthe tone for the children.<br/>\nShow them the wide world of opportunities, offer up many options, but be <br/>\nrespectful of them as individuals. Look at them as your companions in <br/>\nlearning instead of a person that needs knowledge imparted to them and you&#39;ll <br/>\nbe well on your way to this concept of   strewing!!<br/>\nIf you&#39;d like to read more about how other people &quot;strew their paths&quot; there <br/>\nis a thread titled just that at unschooling.com message board, full of <br/>\nwonderful ideas.<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35479,"nextTopicId":35534}}
