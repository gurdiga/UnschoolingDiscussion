Last year my son did an &quot;experiment&quot;<br/>\nwhere he (unknown to me) stuffed toilet paper in the bathroom sink drain and<br/>\noverflow hole, turned on the faucet full blast and closed the door.  Then he<br/>\nsuggested we play outside.  I, again unknowingly, agreed and three hours<br/>\nlater returned.  Once I felt the squishy carpet (10 feet down the hall) and<br/>\ndiscovered the ocean of water streaming out of the bathroom down the hallway<br/>\nand into the heating ducts, I was a screaming zombie!!!!  The water ruined<br/>\nthe subflooring, carpet and pad (throughout 3/4 of the house), ductwork and<br/>\nswelled the doorjambs and drywall.  The damage was over 5 thousand dollars.<br/>\nThankfully insurance picked up a good deal of the &quot;experiment&quot;.  I asked him<br/>\nlater what he was trying to do...he said that he was trying to create an<br/>\nocean by closing the door.  Boy, at the time, school was sure looking good.<br/>\nAnd there are other days when I think school doesn&#39;t look all that bad.  But<br/>\nI must admit, that it was pretty smart of him (at four) to have noticed that<br/>\nthe water flows out better if you stuff it into the overflow hole!  But<br/>\nseriously, I know that I would be having equally hard days (if not harder)<br/>\nsending him off to school and all the issues that brings.  I so enjoy seeing<br/>\nhim grow and learn (and experiment--within reason!) and I would not want to<br/>\nmiss that for the world.<br/>\n    I understand your frustrations.  It sounded like though that the day was<br/>\ngoing really well up until that point.  Hang on to the treasures of the day.<br/>\nWe keep a short journal and write down tidbits of the day to reassure us<br/>\nthat we are on the right path.  Keep sharing your experiences with us...that<br/>\nhelps too.<br/>\nTake Care,<br/>\nTiffany<br/>\nMom of Nick<br/>\nWashington State</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12307,"nextTopicId":12295}}
