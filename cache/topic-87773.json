As much as I want to read every email <br/>\n(and there are many people that ARE able to keep up and read it all) I just <br/>\nHAVE to delete a good part of it.  For instance:  There&#39;s a thread on potty <br/>\ntraining...I read a few but I don&#39;t have any children potty training, so I delete <br/>\nthem all (sorry guys!)  Also, if a thread turns into an argument, unless it&#39;s <br/>\nsomething I believe passionately about and feel I have something more to add, I <br/>\ndelete it.  I don&#39;t have the time, energy, or mental capacity (LOL) to deal <br/>\nwith all the negativity...I&#39;m a foster mom and HAVE to keep my mind positive to <br/>\ndeal with the kid&#39;s daily problems.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to read everything to do with older child parenting, keeping peace and <br/>\nharmony in our lives, new or effective &quot;school&quot; stuff (DVD&#39;s, games, toys, <br/>\nartsy stuff).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe downside, is that TOO OFTEN people don&#39;t change the thread title, and the <br/>\nconversation will be completely different from the title, and unfortunately I <br/>\nmiss some really good stuff.
