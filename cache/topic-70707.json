I&#39;ve been doing it for a few years. The name is gastfreundschaft. German name for an Australian newsletter, a little confusing I know!<br/>\n<br/>\n   I read a book a while ago by Henri Nouwen, a Dutch priest and part of the book was about hospitality. He wrote about friendship and seeing it as  a safe place we create where people can come and be free to be themselves, to be accepted and ministered to while they have need. A friendship that doesn&#39;t try to possess but will allow them to come and go in our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Gastfreundschaft is the German word for hospitality and a german friend explained that it is the opening up of your home to someone and treating them not only as an honoured guest but as a part of the family. An all I have is yours kind of attitude.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So I guess I wanted the newsletter to be that for my homeschooling friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorry, rather long winded explanation but it&#39;s a pretty weird name!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Julie<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

By books many <br/>\n  people mean school-style text books designed for one subject area, one school <br/>\n  year, one level. They mean school books. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Even when I know they mean school books I say, &quot;Yes, we use lots of books.&quot; <br/>\n  By then, my nervous system has relaxed from the unexpected screech of the <br/>\n  realization that some people think that unchoolers somehow have houses devoid of <br/>\n  books. <br/>\n<br/>\n  School-trained adults (like me) have developed an internal school year, and <br/>\n  in the fall we might pine for school supplies and new books. I have a <br/>\n  suggestion for new unschoolers who feel the book-buying imperative coming upon them, <br/>\n  or for experienced unschoolers who have been given money for &quot;supplies&quot; or <br/>\n  whose relatives want ideas about what to buy. The good news is there are hundreds <br/>\n  of these books. The better news is you can find them used almost anywhere. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m talking about collections of trivia. These are gold and diamond mines <br/>\n  for unschooling. I&#39;ll name some books we&#39;ve played with to good advantage, but <br/>\n  there are many out there at used book stores and garage sales, or on the <br/>\n  shelves of your friends and relatives, and probably some right under your nose. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I have a few personal favorites the kids haven&#39;t yet discovered: The Voice <br/>\n  of the Middle Ages in Letters, Royal Anecdotes and Eyewitness to History. Some <br/>\n  people might be &quot;tsking&quot; at this moment that those are not trivia books, but <br/>\n  they are! They are snippets of the best parts of some obscure situations about <br/>\n  which a whole book or chapter might never be written. They&#39;re books about real <br/>\n  things and people and places, but they don&#39;t have to be read from beginning <br/>\n  to end. In fact, there&#39;s no reason to read the whole book. It makes more sense <br/>\n  to flip through, open randomly, play with the index. Mine are all filled with <br/>\n  sticky notes, marginal marks, and folded corners. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Then there are things to read to children at odd moments, when they&#39;re <br/>\n  eating, when we&#39;re sitting in waiting rooms, driving in the van, or reading someone <br/>\n  to sleep. How to Do Just About Anything, published by Reader&#39;s Digest, has <br/>\n  been a guessing game on van trips. I start reading the instructions for making <br/>\n  or doing, and the kids and my husband shout out guesses, getting progressively <br/>\n  closer until they know, and I start another one. Sometimes they want me to <br/>\n  finish what I was reading even though they&#39;ve guessed. Shish kebabs, short <br/>\n  circuits and shower curtains are all on one page! Now that&#39;s educational. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Brewer&#39;s Dictionary of Phrase & Fable has snippets from songs, stories, <br/>\n  riddles, mythology, and literary references which came into public use with a <br/>\n  vengeance. Their entry for Nine Man&#39;s Morris has the game board illustrated, with <br/>\n  instructions for play. The &quot;Whitsun Morris Dance&quot; mentioned in Henry V can be <br/>\n  illuminated for your whole family with this book, as can a few thousand other <br/>\n  common linguistic details of everyday life. <br/>\n<br/>\n  So what is trivia, then? For school kids, trivia is (by definition) a waste <br/>\n  of time. It&#39;s something that will not be on the test. It&#39;s &quot;extra&quot; stuff. For <br/>\n  unschoolers, though, in the wide new world in which everything counts, there <br/>\n  can be no trivia in that sense. If news of the existence of sachets ties in <br/>\n  with what one learned of medieval plagues in Extraordinary Endings of Practically <br/>\n  Everything and Everybody, there are two pointers which tie microbiology to <br/>\n  European cities in the Middle Ages, and lead to paradise-guaranteed pilgrimages <br/>\n  to Rome. Nowadays sanitation and antibiotics keep the plague from &quot;spreading <br/>\n  like the plague.&quot; [Note: Extraordinary Endings... and Extraordinary <br/>\n  Beginnings... might not be suitable for young children who read well. Read-aloud can <br/>\n  avoid some topics that might not be ideal for pre- teens.] <br/>\n<br/>\n  Looking around my office for another book to name, I see Fowler&#39;s Modern <br/>\n  English Usage. Trivia!? Well if there isn&#39;t going to be a test, the history of <br/>\n  the word &quot;paraphernalia&quot; is as interesting as the death of Billy the Kid. There <br/>\n  are minotaurs and griffins in there , just for flipping through! <br/>\n<br/>\n  The edition of The New York Public Library Desk Reference we have might be a <br/>\n  little outdated, but the rules of ice hockey haven&#39;t changed, nor the way in <br/>\n  which one addresses a letter to the Pope, nor the date of the discovery of <br/>\n  Krypton. (Some of you thought it was just a Superman thing, didn&#39;t you? <br/>\n  Nope--1898, the year before aspirin.) <br/>\n<br/>\n  We have a quiz book on New Mexico. You can find one for your state too. We <br/>\n  challenge our adults friends in front of the kids and the kids can&#39;t wait to <br/>\n  know enough to play. I won dessert at a restaurant once knowing how many <br/>\n  counties there were and the kids were in awe. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Stephen Biesty&#39;s cross-sections books, David MacCaulay&#39;s The Way Things <br/>\n  Work, any &quot;What to Do With the Kids...&quot; kinds of books, question/answer books like <br/>\n  The Star Wars Question and Answer Book about Space, all will fill your kids <br/>\n  with more questions than they had before they opened the books. This is good. <br/>\n  This is not school-good, but it&#39;s unschooling-good. Parents don&#39;t have to know <br/>\n  the answers, they just need to be on the lookout for a source to come along. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Doing the Days might be a good intro book for those afraid to embark upon <br/>\n  the sea of trivia. (Look up the history of the word &quot;embark.&quot; Any word history <br/>\n  book will enthrall your whole family.) It&#39;s a set of activities divided by days <br/>\n  of the year, designed to encourage thinking and doing in children. I never <br/>\n  pay attention to the dates, much, just mine it for trivia! <br/>\n<br/>\n  2201 Fascinating Facts is well worth the dollar I paid for it, and The Book <br/>\n  of Fascinating Facts by Encyclopaedia Britannica is worth the whole $13 I paid <br/>\n  for it on sale at Toys &#39;R Us because it has over 350 pages of colored <br/>\n  pictures. Life-size photo of a human stomach, a 1930&#39;s typewriter with the paper half <br/>\n  typed and legible in it, and singing cowboys. Every one of those leads us to <br/>\n  pull out another book, or a record, or to go dig in the garage. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visual dictionaries, books of birds, mammals, local flora, the dictionary, <br/>\n  encyclopedia, atlas, almanac--these books can be used by the hour or by the <br/>\n  half minute. There is no time wasted when children are thinking, asking <br/>\n  questions, fitting new information with what they already have, and all the while <br/>\n  smiling and laughing. Have fun! <br/>\n<br/>\n  © 1998, Sandra Dodd <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

The good news is there are hundreds <br/>\nof these books. The better news is you can find them used almost anywhere. <br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;m talking about collections of trivia. These are gold and diamond mines <br/>\nfor unschooling. I&#39;ll name some books we&#39;ve played with to good advantage, but <br/>\nthere are many out there at used book stores and garage sales, or on the <br/>\nshelves of your friends and relatives, and probably some right under your nose. <br/>\n<br/>\n I have a few personal favorites the kids haven&#39;t yet discovered: The Voice <br/>\nof the Middle Ages in Letters, Royal Anecdotes and Eyewitness to History. Some <br/>\npeople might be &quot;tsking&quot; at this moment that those are not trivia books, but <br/>\nthey are! They are snippets of the best parts of some obscure situations about <br/>\nwhich a whole book or chapter might never be written. They&#39;re books about real <br/>\nthings and people and places, but they don&#39;t have to be read from beginning <br/>\nto end. In fact, there&#39;s no reason to read the whole book. It makes more sense <br/>\nto flip through, open randomly, play with the index. Mine are all filled with <br/>\nsticky notes, marginal marks, and folded corners. <br/>\n<br/>\n Then there are things to read to children at odd moments, when they&#39;re <br/>\neating, when we&#39;re sitting in waiting rooms, driving in the van, or reading someone <br/>\nto sleep. How to Do Just About Anything, published by Reader&#39;s Digest, has <br/>\nbeen a guessing game on van trips. I start reading the instructions for making <br/>\nor doing, and the kids and my husband shout out guesses, getting progressively <br/>\ncloser until they know, and I start another one. Sometimes they want me to <br/>\nfinish what I was reading even though they&#39;ve guessed. Shish kebabs, short <br/>\ncircuits and shower curtains are all on one page! Now that&#39;s educational. <br/>\n<br/>\n Brewer&#39;s Dictionary of Phrase & Fable has snippets from songs, stories, <br/>\nriddles, mythology, and literary references which came into public use with a <br/>\nvengeance. Their entry for Nine Man&#39;s Morris has the game board illustrated, with <br/>\ninstructions for play. The &quot;Whitsun Morris Dance&quot; mentioned in Henry V can be <br/>\nilluminated for your whole family with this book, as can a few thousand other <br/>\ncommon linguistic details of everyday life. <br/>\n<br/>\n So what is trivia, then? For school kids, trivia is (by definition) a waste <br/>\nof time. It&#39;s something that will not be on the test. It&#39;s &quot;extra&quot; stuff. For <br/>\nunschoolers, though, in the wide new world in which everything counts, there <br/>\ncan be no trivia in that sense. If news of the existence of sachets ties in <br/>\nwith what one learned of medieval plagues in Extraordinary Endings of Practically <br/>\nEverything and Everybody, there are two pointers which tie microbiology to <br/>\nEuropean cities in the Middle Ages, and lead to paradise-guaranteed pilgrimages <br/>\nto Rome. Nowadays sanitation and antibiotics keep the plague from &quot;spreading <br/>\nlike the plague.&quot; [Note: Extraordinary Endings... and Extraordinary <br/>\nBeginnings... might not be suitable for young children who read well. Read-aloud can <br/>\navoid some topics that might not be ideal for pre- teens.] <br/>\n<br/>\n Looking around my office for another book to name, I see Fowler&#39;s Modern <br/>\nEnglish Usage. Trivia!? Well if there isn&#39;t going to be a test, the history of <br/>\nthe word &quot;paraphernalia&quot; is as interesting as the death of Billy the Kid. There <br/>\nare minotaurs and griffins in there , just for flipping through! <br/>\n<br/>\n The edition of The New York Public Library Desk Reference we have might be a <br/>\nlittle outdated, but the rules of ice hockey haven&#39;t changed, nor the way in <br/>\nwhich one addresses a letter to the Pope, nor the date of the discovery of <br/>\nKrypton. (Some of you thought it was just a Superman thing, didn&#39;t you? <br/>\nNope--1898, the year before aspirin.) <br/>\n<br/>\n We have a quiz book on New Mexico. You can find one for your state too. We <br/>\nchallenge our adults friends in front of the kids and the kids can&#39;t wait to <br/>\nknow enough to play. I won dessert at a restaurant once knowing how many <br/>\ncounties there were and the kids were in awe. <br/>\n<br/>\n Stephen Biesty&#39;s cross-sections books, David MacCaulay&#39;s The Way Things <br/>\nWork, any &quot;What to Do With the Kids...&quot; kinds of books, question/answer books like <br/>\nThe Star Wars Question and Answer Book about Space, all will fill your kids <br/>\nwith more questions than they had before they opened the books. This is good. <br/>\nThis is not school-good, but it&#39;s unschooling-good. Parents don&#39;t have to know <br/>\nthe answers, they just need to be on the lookout for a source to come along. <br/>\n<br/>\n Doing the Days might be a good intro book for those afraid to embark upon <br/>\nthe sea of trivia. (Look up the history of the word &quot;embark.&quot; Any word history <br/>\nbook will enthrall your whole family.) It&#39;s a set of activities divided by days <br/>\nof the year, designed to encourage thinking and doing in children. I never <br/>\npay attention to the dates, much, just mine it for trivia! <br/>\n<br/>\n 2201 Fascinating Facts is well worth the dollar I paid for it, and The Book <br/>\nof Fascinating Facts by Encyclopaedia Britannica is worth the whole $13 I paid <br/>\nfor it on sale at Toys &#39;R Us because it has over 350 pages of colored <br/>\npictures. Life-size photo of a human stomach, a 1930&#39;s typewriter with the paper half <br/>\ntyped and legible in it, and singing cowboys. Every one of those leads us to <br/>\npull out another book, or a record, or to go dig in the garage. <br/>\n<br/>\n Visual dictionaries, books of birds, mammals, local flora, the dictionary, <br/>\nencyclopedia, atlas, almanac--these books can be used by the hour or by the <br/>\nhalf minute. There is no time wasted when children are thinking, asking <br/>\nquestions, fitting new information with what they already have, and all the while <br/>\nsmiling and laughing. Have fun! <br/>\n<br/>\n© 1998, Sandra Dodd</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: New - HELP!!!!!!!!!1","postDate":"1054048745","msgId":71016,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI5LjQwZDRkMjQ5LjJjMDRkYmU5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70999,"nextInTopic":71019,"prevInTime":71015,"nextInTime":71017,"topicId":70707,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/27/03 5:46:37 AM, momhomenurse@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-842556854\">In a message dated 5/27/03 5:46:37 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:momhomenurse@...\">momhomenurse@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I know some unschoolers, some have been  <br/>\n<br/>\nfor years some just started but either way these children for the <br/>\n<br/>\nmost part don&#39;t even touch the TV except if they are watching <br/>\n<br/>\nsomething about what they are learning about.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow will they know &quot;what they are learning about&quot; until it presents itself?<br/>\nI think you mean they only turned the TV on if a program had been listed that <br/>\nwas a resource for an academic subject they had on their list to study.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not unschooling at its wild and vibrant best.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust accidently, Marty came upon a PBS show on Viking ships and how they&#39;re <br/>\ndated.
