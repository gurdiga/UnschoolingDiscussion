It is the <br/>\nwhole story about Jesus and what he has to offer and why he came to earth.  <br/>\nIt sounds like you may have read it before, but now you can read it through <br/>\ndifferent eyes so to speak for a different reason, you instead of your <br/>\ndaughter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand your thoughts about church.  I just started a bible study called <br/>\nBSF (bible study fellowship).  Apparently, it is all over the world.  We have <br/>\nbeen studying the book of John since September and it has been extremely <br/>\nmeaningful to me personally.   Jesus did not go to church.  I think just <br/>\nreading a bit on your own time might really help your daughter and maybe you <br/>\nin a new way this time.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck,<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14879,"nextTopicId":62039}}
