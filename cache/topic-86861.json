I keep forgetting <br/>\nto call the dishwasher repairman to fix our leaking dishwasher, and instead <br/>\nhave been washing them by hand. It has become a &quot;thinking time&quot; for me. I <br/>\nchoose to wash them by hand. And it has actually become  enjoyable to me because of <br/>\nthe new colorful dishes.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What I don&#39;t like is sorting the silverware. It didn&#39;t bother me a bit when <br/>\nthe divider broke. I just dump them in the drawer now...hahahaha. I know one <br/>\nof these days I &quot;should&quot; ( I suppose) have more order to that drawer..but boy, <br/>\nwhat fun it is to just dump all of them in...it must be my inner child coming <br/>\nout &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marcia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":86697,"nextTopicId":86824}}
