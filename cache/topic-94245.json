It isn&#39;t often that I (or we) talk to people about this. We may talk of how hard it was to deal with behaviors and such...but not usually about the impact the lying has had on us. Or in some cases, how it has hurt us forever. For instance, I now have PTSD from the chaos here at home. And worse, because of the &quot;professionals&quot; believing the child instead of us, we feel violated and distrustful of many other &quot;professionals.&quot; <br/>\nI&#39;ve had to do a lot of soul searching in the past few months, to try to come to terms with what our lives were really like. Sometimes after people telling you over and over you did something wrong, you tend to believe it. Self doubt is a powerful thing. When those feelings creep back, I go read my journal. I read about how scared I was for myself and my family. I read about how much I loved him and how I wanted to help him...  Yes, I read about a lot of anger too.. but I read about it because it was in there that I wrote it, instead of acting on it. Then, after reading...I can remember that I was very much the victim in my house. My finance&#39;s child was definatly the victim in his mothers house...but not here. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I&#39;m not alone, but sometimes it does seem it.

Twice he was in family therapy where they <br/>\nwould see family members some of the sessions.  Once it was when I was living <br/>\nwith him and my mom, when I was about 25 and he was seven, I think.  The <br/>\ncounsellor LOVED him, love him loved him, and concluded that somehow we were <br/>\ntotally screwing him up.  Well I think my mom was. &lt;g&gt;  But I wasn&#39;t able to <br/>\nconvince her much.  And I knew much of it was him being like his alcoholic, sneaky, <br/>\nabandoning father (not MY father), who had another family he had walked out on <br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few years later he was in my custody and was 13/14.  He was court-ordered <br/>\nto be evaluated by a therapist.  He went four times and then I went in for the <br/>\nadvisement and summary, for the therapist to tell me what he was planning to <br/>\ntell the social workers.   We (Keith and I) weren&#39;t in question.  It was <br/>\nwhether they were going to put in him a group home or therapy or what, because he <br/>\nhad gotten in trouble not many months after he came to live with us in <br/>\nAlbuquerque.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe therapist started talking to me and after a few statements, I interrupted <br/>\nhim and asked if maybe he had the wrong folder.  I honestly thought he was <br/>\ntalking about an entirely different human.  No, he had the right folder.  My <br/>\nbrother had just created a character and laid on the drama and soundtrack and <br/>\nthere was things in there that had never even remotely happened.  It wasn&#39;t like <br/>\nhe told his own story skewed.  He made up a whole new story.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a waste of time. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut me telling the therapist that made him defensive.  Had he been totally <br/>\nduped?  Or was I trying to cover up my neglect of this poor, sweet teen who had <br/>\ntrusted me to help make his life better?<br/>\n<br/>\nuh... yeah.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo they sent him on an Outward Bound trip as further combo eval-therapy.  The <br/>\ncounsellors there LOVED him.  One of the juvenile court judges visited and <br/>\nLOVED him.  What could possibly be his relatives&#39; problem?  This child is <br/>\nWONDERFUL.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo listen, he&#39;s 32 now and his name is Justin Eugene Bradley.  He&#39;s probably <br/>\nin Arizona.  He&#39;s tall, has straight teeth (braces we paid for), cheap <br/>\ntattoos, GREAT smile, self-effacing manner, sweet first impression, and if you tell <br/>\nhim you&#39;re homeschooling he&#39;ll name me and he WILL charm you.  Do NOT lend him <br/>\nmoney, don&#39;t give him beer, don&#39;t let him know where your car keys are.  Don&#39;t <br/>\ntrust him with your stuff or your daughters.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut maybe tell him his mom&#39;s dead.  He&#39;s been gone nearly a year, since he <br/>\nstole all her money after her SS and VA checks arrived in May 2003.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was his biological mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe birth control should be mandatory, in the water, required.

I know <br/>\nthat I tried so hard to love him and help him...but it wasn&#39;t enough. He needs <br/>\nconstant 1 on 1 attention and direction. And with two other kids I couldn&#39;t <br/>\ngive him that. I tried so hard...&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n*************************************<br/>\nAna - I sat here nodding my head at your entire letter.  I too have read <br/>\neverything I could find on RAD.  It is such a sad, disheartening situation for a <br/>\nkid.  Unfortunately, some children are just so far gone that an institution or <br/>\nhospital is the only safe place for them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith attachment disorders, the sooner it is dealt with, the better.  Time is <br/>\nof the essence.  Our 10 yo was pretty bad off when we first got him, but he <br/>\nwas placed with us at 7 1/2 years old (we were his 11th home) and he has <br/>\nimproved so much we believe he&#39;s attached really well.  He is also mildly MR, which <br/>\nhonestly has probably helped him.  I believe his limitations softened the <br/>\neffects of the abuse and moving around he had to deal with the first 7 years of his <br/>\nlife.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd like I said earlier, luck had a lot to do with our adoptions/fostering <br/>\nbeing successful.  We were NOT placed with kids who could not be helped.  I know <br/>\nof a few kids in our agency that act out as your fiance&#39;s son did, and the <br/>\nparents are hanging on by a thin thread.  The only one keeping their lives <br/>\ntogether is the attachment therapist many of us have gone to.  She&#39;s awesome, and <br/>\nhas studied with Dr. Keck and Regina Kupecky at their Ohio attachment clinic.  <br/>\nThey are a God-send.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy heart goes out to you, you&#39;re in my thoughts today.

Its no picnic..<br/>\n<br/>\nMy fiance&#39;s son who is 9 left out house last November because we could not handle his behaviors any longer. He had been abused as a baby by his biological mother, deprived, and failed to form any bond to her. The state took him away from her when he was 4 and gave him to my fiance. His behaviors though kept getting worse. (they gave all three kids to him. The two girls were quickly taken by the state again because they were acting out too much because of their mother)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe things he did threatened our children, and myself. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve been physically assulted by him. Our house destroyed. Animals abused. Locks on my bedroom door to keep him out. We went without food because he detroyed or ate it all. He urinated and defecated all over his room daily. No remorse. No empathy. Nothing. Just anger, sadness (though he didn&#39;t show it) and violence towards me...the Mom..<br/>\n<br/>\nI love him...and I tried so hard to help him. We adhered to Nancy Thomas&#39;s books and videos. (When Love is Not Enough) and read everything we could about Reactive Attachment Disorder..  still, we couldn&#39;t stop the hurt inside him. Coudn&#39;t find a therapist that took Medicaid...an attachment therapist. Oh sure, we found lots of regular ones...but those don&#39;t work...<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter countless lies to his teachers in school about not being fed, etc.. (a very common issue with RAD children is food) the state decided to take him and put him in foster care. They even had the nerve to say that his problems were because of us. My two biological kids disagree...and they are very happy with him out of the house now.<br/>\n<br/>\nconsidering he has two older sisters, both RAD, ODD, ADHD, and one BPD and in residential treatment....and he was raised by the same mother ... I&#39;m not surprised that he is hurt and I wanted him badly to get some help. Unfortunatly, they diagnose him with RAD but they won&#39;t help him. They just put him in a home like his sisters and work on behavioral problems...but not the real core problem. (his lack of attachment) I know, because his sisters have been gone for over 3 years now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey will soon be terminating my fiance&#39;s parental rights because they say he doesn&#39;t know how to parent their &quot;special needs&quot;... yet they won&#39;t show him how.. they will take the time to show the foster parents and the adoption parents how they think it should be done though.. I wish the same consideration was given here...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been a long road for me, living 2 1/2 years with a child that has RAD.
