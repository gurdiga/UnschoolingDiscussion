I would <br/>\nguess that a radical unschooler is one that extends unschooling into a way <br/>\nof life. One that sees unschooling as more than just a way to educate but as <br/>\na way of life, a philosophy. (anyone who has a better explanation....) One <br/>\nthing I have never, ever heard an unschooler, radical or not, say is that <br/>\nthey *let* their children be destructive in the name of unschooling because <br/>\nit is &quot;what the child needs to do.&quot; I do know of a family who has a very <br/>\nartistic daughter. She has decorated her room in her own way. The walls are <br/>\npainted by her, in an ever-changing mural. Her Mom has said on many <br/>\noccasions that, if need be, she can just paint it all over, its good that <br/>\nher dd can express<br/>\nherself and they encourage it. In my own home, the attic accesses are in my <br/>\nkids rooms. They are little doors close to the floor. I have painted those <br/>\nwith blackboard paint, and my kids color away on those little doors. <br/>\nColoring on the walls in the name of doing what you want to do because you <br/>\nneed to do it isn&#39;t unschooling. Giving your children the freedom to express <br/>\nthemselves in their own space isn&#39;t a bad thing. Is this contradictory? I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think so, but some might.<br/>\n~Nancy clear as mud right? &lt;bwg&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nActually Nancy, to me it is clear. I was just wondering about it and was <br/>\nonly relaying the thought as it was conveyed to me. I was the one that <br/>\nmentioned radical unschoolers only because my friend said they had a name <br/>\nfor their beliefs. Radical was the only term I had heard of but not used as <br/>\nshe mentioned. I was on a radical unschoolers list years ago and didn&#39;t see <br/>\nmention of letting kids destroy things. It was a just a word I thought maybe <br/>\nshe was thinking of. I have no problem with kids decorating their own rooms. <br/>\nYou should see my kids walls!!!!! The oldest just recently pulled off her <br/>\nnaked Abercrombie and Fitch models to substitute Eminem. I like the naked <br/>\nguys better!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut again my friend said this particular group would actually let the kids <br/>\ndraw where they wanted with no thought as to paint the walls with blackboard <br/>\npaint or even hang paper up. Just let them at it wherever.<br/>\nAgain, not sure how accurate her account of all this is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1512150,"authorName":"Peggy","from":"Peggy &lt;peggy@...&gt;","profile":"margotapple","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] radicals?","postDate":"1034536646","msgId":46288,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEQTlDNkM2LkRDOUZBNDQ4QGxpbm1heC5zYW8uYXJpem9uYS5lZHU+","referencesHeader":"PEYxODVSUWNxbVN2dXg0SmY3enkwMDAwM2NkZkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":46286,"nextInTopic":46289,"prevInTime":46287,"nextInTime":46289,"topicId":46252,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sounds like TCS, which taken out of context can be seen as out of control to outsiders.

Those who want to explore the TCS viewpoint should check out their<br/>\nwebsite. Debating it without understanding where they are coming from is<br/>\npretty senseless. It does seem pretty extreme to those who think they have a<br/>\nright to tell their children how to live their lives. [ I am not TCS and am<br/>\nnot affiliate with the site. ;) ]<br/>\n<br/>\nRadical unschoolers are *us*. On other lists the term is used to distinguish<br/>\nthose who unschool from those relaxed homeschoolers who follow some kind of<br/>\nprescribed curriculum guides, like math or english of some sort on a regular<br/>\nschedule. Guess it is just so much fun to call oneself an unschooler than<br/>\neveryone wants to whether they do or not. Letting go of control seems<br/>\nimportant. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Bianco wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was recently talking to another homeschooler.
