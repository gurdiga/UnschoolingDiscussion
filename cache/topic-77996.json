I belong to a smaller local hs support<br/>\ngroup and we&#39;ve just started to go to some things they are having. One lady<br/>\nin the group decided herself she would have craft day once a week at her<br/>\nhouse. She has 3 kids and seems very crafty herself with ideas I just don&#39;t<br/>\nthink of. She has a large folding table in her playroom area with access to<br/>\nall kinds of paints, paper, shells etc. So that&#39;s where the kids do stuff.<br/>\nShe comes up with the ideas and anyone else who has a great idea can offer<br/>\nto bring things for the following week. I just bring the drinks and snacks<br/>\nand supplies when I&#39;m told. &lt;BG&gt; The very first thing my kids did was make a<br/>\nmini rain forest. It cost $4.00 per child for that one. They made them in<br/>\nbig soda bottles which we brought and she supplied all the dirt and other<br/>\nstuff we put in the bottles. She bought little plants to put in there too.<br/>\nThen we made wind chimes from seashells. She didn&#39;t charge anything for that<br/>\none. It was shells she had collected (we&#39;re in FL) and string and some round<br/>\nwooden thingies she had. Then someone else brought in little crafts from the<br/>\nOriental Trading Co. which she bought 12 of for like 5 bucks. She didn&#39;t<br/>\ncharge us for those either. Little foam hands that the kids cut out (in the<br/>\nshape of their own hand) decorated and attached a clothespin to. It had a<br/>\nmagnet on the back you can attach to the fridge and it was like a reminder<br/>\nclip or a chore (gasp) list or something. Kids really liked those. We were<br/>\nto do tie dye T shirts today but it was cancelled. I was supplying the<br/>\nrubber bands and everyone was to bring their own shirt. She supplied the dye<br/>\nand didn&#39;t charge us for that either. Of course we all help out with<br/>\nbringing supplies when she needs them and food and stuff too. I made her a<br/>\nhomeschooling T shirt today and also came home with a kitten!!! Not a craft<br/>\nbut the real thing.

You can get over it.<br/>\nI take my kids every week to a house where we do crafts. The house is<br/>\nnothing like mine at all. There is stuff everywhere. You have to move things<br/>\njust to sit down on the couch or dining room chair. My first thought when I<br/>\nwent there was &quot;Oh My!!&quot; To myself of course. There are animals everywhere.<br/>\nThe house looks like a tornado when through it, literally. My kids<br/>\nabsolutely love going there. They can&#39;t wait for Wednesdays. It was<br/>\ncancelled today and they were heartbroken. And you know what, even though I<br/>\nwould never have my house look that way, I love going over too. We all just<br/>\nhave the best time there and I really admire this woman to open her house up<br/>\nto us all regardless of what it looks like. She did comment that she worries<br/>\nabout what others think, but doesn&#39;t care enough to stop because her kids<br/>\nenjoy it so much. (having the others come over to play) I really try to use<br/>\nthis woman as an example to me and not be so darn anal about what my house<br/>\nlooks like when I have someone over. The kids really don&#39;t *see* it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went for the first time to a good friends house a couple weeks ago. They<br/>\nalways come over here. There&#39;s more to do here and I don&#39;t mind at all. When<br/>\nwe went to their house, the kids had fun. My mom was later asking me about<br/>\nit and I mentioned how small the house was and how many people were there in<br/>\nreference to Alyssa being very shy until some people left and there was room<br/>\nto breath. Sierra heard me and asked me with much shock if I thought the<br/>\nhouse was really small. She didn&#39;t think so at all. It was funny because I<br/>\ncould put there house inside my living and dining room. Made no difference<br/>\nto me, but I realized how kids just don&#39;t see things like some of us do.<br/>\n<br/>\nInvite the kids and people over, forget about worrying what they will think<br/>\nand you will all have fun. And if by some chance they do have a problem with<br/>\nit, they&#39;re probably not the kind of people you want to hang out with<br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3899762,"authorName":"coyote&#39;s corner","from":"&quot;coyote&#39;s corner&quot; &lt;jana@...&gt;","profile":"calourojm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] difficulty making connections","postDate":"1060188904","msgId":78023,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA2ZGMwMWMzNWMzYiQ3YzIwYjUxMCQ0MTM2MDk0NEBBb3Blbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDljLjM0MDRjYzE4LjJjNjI4NzRlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":78021,"nextInTopic":78028,"prevInTime":78022,"nextInTime":78024,"topicId":77996,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"YES!!!
