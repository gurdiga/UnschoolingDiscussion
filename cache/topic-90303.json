So, do you think this is due to laziness and they were lying about <br/>\ndoing a lot of reading, or are some people simply unable to relate to what&#39;s <br/>\nbeing <br/>\nsaid unless it&#39;s said directly to them?  I know these aren&#39;t the only two <br/>\npossibilities, but they seem the most likely to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What do you think?  I&#39;m finding myself saying the same old [stuff] over and <br/>\nover, and it&#39;s getting hard to come up with new ways of wording it.  I know <br/>\nthe new people don&#39;t realize it, but it has to get old for the rest of us.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s <br/>\nreally cool when someone asks something that I have to actually think about, <br/>\nlol.  I can only imagine how you must feel.  You&#39;ve been doing this a lot <br/>\nlonger than I have, and I&#39;m feeling a little burnt out sometimes.  &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first read this, I thought *I* might have written it in a daze or <br/>\nwhile sleeping and had just forgotten I&#39;d written it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, the problem is not necessarily the same &quot;idea&quot;----it&#39;s the same damned <br/>\nQUESTION. Word for word. No alterations. Sometimes the child-in-question is <br/>\nthe *same* age and gender as the child who was discussed the *last* time it was <br/>\nbrought up (not to mention the month or season before). Did the questioner <br/>\nREALLY read last week&#39;s posts? Really? REALLY???<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that the questioner maybe *has* read for a week or two (not just <br/>\nthe daily posts, but also the archives) and that maybe she&#39;s thought about what <br/>\nshe&#39;s read. But she wants to know that it&#39;ll ALSO work in *her* family. Well, <br/>\nwe&#39;re all willing to say YES, it can. Again. It can. We can NOT tell her <br/>\nexactly how it will work. We can&#39;t even tell her definitively that it will <br/>\nwork----if she doesn&#39;t DO the work. We can tell her again and again that it *has* <br/>\nworked in our families and how. We can tell her that it can work if she&#39;s willing <br/>\nto trust and respect her children and the process. But it really won&#39;t be any <br/>\ndifferent from the way we told the last person.  (Except for Joyce----she can <br/>\npull another great analogy out of her butt every single DAY!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, I&#39;m willing to &quot;do it again&quot; and sometimes I&#39;m not. I&#39;m about to <br/>\nthe point where I&#39;m NOT.  I just want to scream, &quot;READ!&quot;  And then I&#39;ll just <br/>\nwatch Joyce and Sandra and Deb and and Mary and Tia and Kathryn and Pam(s) and <br/>\nRen and Rue and Lyle and ... do it all over again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m on Unschooling-101 because I feel that &quot;someone&quot; has to be there (other <br/>\nthan Joyce and Deb). Otherwise it&#39;s overrun by NON-unschoolers giving really <br/>\nbad advice----which has happened!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there weren&#39;t ---what did someone call us? Professional unschoolers? &lt;g&gt; <br/>\nIf there weren&#39;t &quot;seasoned/experienced/got-it unschoolers&quot; around to answer the <br/>\nsame questions over and over, what would happen to all the potential <br/>\nunschoolers? They&#39;d HAVE to read what others had already written (in the archives) <br/>\n---just like many of the old-timers did before the &#39;net (when they just had GWS <br/>\nand a few books)! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf other experienced unschoolers like this original poster *are* getting <br/>\nburnt out and exhausted, there&#39;ll be fewer and fewer experienced unschoolers to <br/>\nhelp. Burn out is burn out!  What if we ALL quit? (won&#39;t happen, but you know...)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will (I hope! &lt;g&gt;) always be experienced unschoolers around to help the <br/>\nnewbies. It&#39;s a passion! But the burn out factor IS there! I think that you <br/>\nshould definitely ask a question if you have one----ALWAYS. BUT! If you can <br/>\nfind the answer in the same spot without asking the *same* question, <br/>\nwell----isn&#39;t that better? MUST it be explained *just* to you? To your exact <br/>\nspecifications? Can&#39;t you take what you read and translate it into your situation? You&#39;re <br/>\ngoing to have to anyway because EACH family is different: there are no two <br/>\nalike!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one of the &quot;issues&quot; that comes up here often: that some poster&#39;s <br/>\nadvice/writing style/inspiration is not what *you* wanted to hear. Well, then the <br/>\nnext poster might be &quot;just what you  needed&quot;---or the next or the next or the <br/>\nnext. And the first poster might have been spot on with someone else. If we <br/>\nlose one, well.......<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advice and inspiration here is free. My fear is that when an experienced <br/>\nunschooler has had enough of the same-old-same-old,.....well, I&#39;d HATE to lose <br/>\nthat poster! Each experienced unschooler is invaluable to this process of <br/>\nnurturing newbies. Each one! Because *that* experienced poster&#39;s advice might be <br/>\nthe one that&#39;s so inspiring to YOU.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo! &lt;g&gt; Please read, read, and read some more----not just the daily posts, <br/>\nwhich can indeed be daunting all by themselves: this is a *very* active list. <br/>\nBut read the archives at the site. Follow threads that interest you or that <br/>\naddress your concerns. It&#39;s rare that a new issue comes up. They happen, but it&#39;s <br/>\nrare. Spanking, chores, reading, bedtimes, algebra, in-laws, alarm clocks, <br/>\nspouses, etc.----they&#39;ve all been discussed again and again. After you&#39;ve read <br/>\nand read, it&#39;ll be a part of you and you can even start *quoting* some of these <br/>\nbrilliant people. We&#39;ll still be here for your more pressing concerns (that <br/>\nwe&#39;d LOVE to explore---we&#39;re always up for a *new* challenge! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess we&#39;re between a rock and a hard place: if you don&#39;t ask questions, <br/>\nwe&#39;re here twiddling our thumbs. If you ask the SAME questions that have been <br/>\nrepeatedly answered, we&#39;ll burn out. I guess my suggestion is this: read until <br/>\nyou&#39;re blind! &lt;g&gt; Then if you STILL have questions, challenge us! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve probably muddied the situation even more, but I know where this note to <br/>\nSandra came from. I&#39;ve been there. I don&#39;t want newbies to quit asking; I just <br/>\nwant them to think about their situation a bit more before jumping in with <br/>\nthe same word-for-word questions. I WANT to help; I really do. I enjoy it. I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be here ever day if I didn&#39;t. I certainly wouldn&#39;t have put on the <br/>\nconferences! But the &quot;if I let him, he would________ all day&quot; ....well, I find it <br/>\nhysterical that Sandra&#39;s finally started a list of those! We hear it so much! <br/>\n&lt;G&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nYour situation *is* different from the last poster&#39;s, but our advice can&#39;t <br/>\nchange much: we&#39;re still describing our own families and what *we&#39;ve* done/can <br/>\ndo! It&#39;s all we have! You&#39;re going to *have* to tweak our advice anyway to fit <br/>\nyour family. Try it ----or at least THINK about it----before you ask the same <br/>\nquestion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~VERY respectfully, Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":144628419,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"&quot;Kelli Traaseth&quot; &lt;tktraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] question about how people learn about unschooling","postDate":"1076089727","msgId":90356,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzIwMWMzZWNkOSQ3OTQyNmE4MCRhMjMzMTlhY0B5b3VyZ2c4N3Zxem96cT4=","referencesHeader":"PDE0LjIxZGM4NWRhLjJkNTNmNWU3QGFvbC5jb20+IDwwMDA3MDFjM2VjYzEkYTYyMTc2ODAkNjEwMWE4YzBAZGVpcmRyZXBqMzEwOHk+"},"prevInTopic":90355,"nextInTopic":90357,"prevInTime":90355,"nextInTime":90357,"topicId":90303,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I think that&#39;s why we have grandparents. :)  Unfortunately in <br/>\ntoday&#39;s society we often don&#39;t have grandparents living nearby their <br/>\ngrandkids, or the grandparents are working or don&#39;t have the <br/>\nexperience needed to help people.  (If Grandma didn&#39;t breastfeed or <br/>\ncook from scratch or sew, she can&#39;t pass those skills down to her <br/>\ngrandkids)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a huge mental block when it comes to sewing.  I&#39;ve read books <br/>\nand websites, I&#39;ve read my sewing machine instruction book, but I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t figure out how to thread my bobbin.  And once I took the <br/>\nbobbin compartment apart, I couldn&#39;t figure out how to put it back <br/>\ntogether again. The diagrams in the instruction book didn&#39;t help me <br/>\nand my very non-technical brain couldn&#39;t figure it out.  I&#39;m an <br/>\notherwise intelligent person, but I have huge difficulties figuring <br/>\nout how to sew.  So last time dd had pants she wanted hemmed, I <br/>\ncalled a friend.  I made her lunch, her kids played with my kids, and <br/>\nshe patiently helped me through all the steps so that I could hem the <br/>\npants. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot of literature available about breastfeeding.  But La <br/>\nLeche league exists even though people could just read The Womanly <br/>\nArt of Breastfeeding.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen dd wanted to make pancakes for the first time, she read the <br/>\ncookbook but still wanted me to stand with her and encourage her as <br/>\nshe made them.  &quot;I can flip them now?&quot;  &quot;Yes, I told you, as soon as <br/>\nyou see bubbles&quot;.  &quot;There are bubbles here, but are there enough <br/>\nbubbles?&quot;  &quot;Yes, go ahead and flip them.&quot;  &quot;What if the pancake <br/>\nbreaks when I flip it?&quot;  &quot;That would be ok, it will still taste just <br/>\nas good.&quot;  &quot;So I should flip it?&quot;  &quot;Yes, go ahead and flip it.&quot;  And <br/>\nshe finally did.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I have obtained permission to quote from a private e-mail, from a <br/>\nconfident <br/>\n&gt; unschooler who has spent a lot of time trying to help others get <br/>\nit.

Unschooling goes against what society and loved ones say is &quot;right&quot; and &quot;good&quot; for children. Newbies just need to hear from people living this right now that they are not going to screw up their kids, the kind of rhetoric probably being flung at them from lots of directions. They&#39;re in that hand-holding phase where advice needs to be tailored to their lives. Whether veterans really want to continue this coddling is a whole &#39;nother question. *g*  It&#39;s like when people join twelve step programs and get a sponsor to check in with daily.

I was intrigued.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the short time I&#39;ve been on this list and reading websites, testimonials, etc....I have noticed a lot of the same questions/concerns tossed around.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor myself, I know that my upbringing has contributed a lot to my fears of &quot;Am I really doing the right thing???&quot;, but I have simply to watch what&#39;s really happening to discover that I am, indeed, doing what&#39;s best for my family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the last week, I kept thinking &quot;Man, if Nathan comes home and finds out I let Madison play video games all day...he&#39;s going to be really upset and I&#39;m going to get a lecture on how irresponsible I&#39;m being!!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I sat down and showed him some articles.  Madison is an avid gamer.  He always has been.  I remember when he was 3 and we had a PlayStation.  He would sit there and get so into playing that he&#39;d forget he was potty trained.  He was just flat out passionate about it.  It drove me crazy.  I kept saying &quot;He&#39;s going to end up some veggie that&#39;s addicted to video games and never make anything of himself!!!!&quot;  He was only 3!!!  I&#39;ve still struggled with it over the years, but in making the decision to homeschool/unschool him, I have also forced myself to let go.  To stop being my parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how people learn about unschooling (this is stricty opinion) is by doing.  It&#39;s a process.  Although, I can honestly say that the instinct to reach for the nearest &quot;seasoned&quot; unschooler and say &quot;OH PLEASE HELP ME!!!  I&#39;M SCARED!&quot; is strong, I try to hold myself back and say &quot;The info is here somewhere&quot;...in other words..look before you leap.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve ingested a lot of information over the last two weeks or so.  It&#39;s helpful.  It&#39;s still scary, but I did talk to my husband.  I showed him the same articles I&#39;d read.  I told him about how Madison really needs to &quot;de-school&quot;..and you know what the result was?  He was proud.  He was proud of me for letting go and finally getting to know this really cool little boy I&#39;ve got.  We can&#39;t wait to get started on the other two :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly Selden<br/>\nMom to Morgan Elaine, Madison William and Ayden Maxwell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, February 05, 2004 2:39 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] question about how people learn about unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have obtained permission to quote from a private e-mail, from a confident <br/>\n  unschooler who has spent a lot of time trying to help others get it.

I have done a lot of reading.  I also was raised <br/>\ncompletely opposite to what I am trying to achieve with my own family.  In <br/>\nmy mind, I often feel like I have this battle going on between what I <br/>\ninstinctually know is right (and from what I have read), and my own <br/>\nupbringing.  So although I have read a lot and know where I am going, I also <br/>\nhave to struggle with responding to my children in ways that my own parents <br/>\nresponded to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nB)  Reading something and understanding it, and then actually living it are <br/>\ntwo different things.  I have come to this site to learn from parents who <br/>\nhave been unschooling for awhile and who have dealt with various situations, <br/>\nto learn concrete ways that I can live peacefully with my own family.  Like <br/>\nI said before, I never have actually seen a family live peacefully.  And <br/>\nwhile I am not really &quot;seeing&quot; it on this message board, I am hearing <br/>\nreal-life situations that will more than likely occur in my own family <br/>\nsomeday.<br/>\n<br/>\nC)  I love John Holt&#39;s books (and other&#39;s too - but especially John  :).  <br/>\nAnd while I read them before I found this message board, it wasn&#39;t until I <br/>\nstarted reading this board that I really started to &quot;get&quot; what he was saying <br/>\nin relation to living in day-to-day life.<br/>\n<br/>\nD)  I am uncertain as to the &quot;repeat question&quot; remark.  It isn&#39;t a repeat <br/>\nquestion if the person has never asked it before.....?  I am sure it is to <br/>\nother people who have been on the board awhile, but that is to be expected, <br/>\nright?  Especially if this board is for explaining unschooling to other <br/>\npeople...  Also, although I have read a lot about unschooling, there are <br/>\ncertain things that I never read in unschooling books that I have learned at <br/>\nthis message board - such as issues regarding eating, bedtimes, TV, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nErika  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nWhat are the 5 hot job markets for 2004?
