She plays it as well as my 11 and 14 year olds.<br/>\nThe skills needed to use all 7 buttons on the controller (most often in<br/>\ncombinations of two or more buttons) is definately nothing to sneeze at.<br/>\nTabitha can manuever her way around the Mario game and the Banjo Kazooie<br/>\ngame even though just to get to the &quot;world&quot; you are looking for is a huge<br/>\nmaze of hallways and secret rooms, pipes and tunnels.  She astounds me with<br/>\nher ability to &quot;discover&quot; secret rooms the rest of us never found.  She also<br/>\nlearned to recognize numbers that no amount of flashcards in combination<br/>\nwith counting bears could teach her.  She knows how many &quot;lives&quot; she has<br/>\nleft by looking at the numbers.  When we reached the goal the other day in<br/>\nBanjo Kazooie there was a big quiz about sounds and sites in the game.  If<br/>\nTabitha hadn&#39;t helped us with it we would not have cracked it.  She learned<br/>\nmore from that game than from anything else!<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also has an incredible vocabulary.  Her preschool teacher wants to do a<br/>\ntest on her because she thinks she&#39;s brilliant.  You know what our secret<br/>\nis?  Cartoons!  I know they are violent and I hate that but she has learned<br/>\nso much from them that I don&#39;t tell her not to watch them.  She has tested<br/>\nas near adult in vocabulary skills alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis child was born weighing just over one pound and we were told not to<br/>\nexpect much from her.  Well, if anyone ever tells me that unschooling can&#39;t<br/>\nwork, I have my Tabby as a demonstration that watching tv and playing<br/>\nNintendo can teach plenty.  Now if I could get her to watch more of PBS than<br/>\nBarney and TeleTubbies maybe she could start working on world peace...or<br/>\nmaybe Barney and TeleTubbies are all you need for world peace!<br/>\n<br/>\nKim, the long winded.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64,"nextTopicId":282}}
