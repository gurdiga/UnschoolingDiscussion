The Biography<br/>\nGame.&quot;<br/>\nSo this is for some new people who are still puzzling about TV and what<br/>\nkids will learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve never seen this game it&#39;s like a modern Trivial Pursuit where<br/>\nall the questions are about people. <br/>\nWe were three adults and four children playing.   Dylan was the youngest<br/>\nat ten and the others twelve, thirteen and fifteen.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, these other kids don&#39;t get to watch The Simpsons so it was actually<br/>\npretty funny when Dylan answered questions right and said &quot;That was on<br/>\nthe Simpsons!&quot;   I wonder if their mom will give it some thought now?    <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the clues my son answered were for Karl Marx,  The Who,  Pope<br/>\nJohn Paul II, Paul Newman, Maya Angelou,  Walt Whitman,  Davy Crockett, <br/>\nJesse Jackson, Steven Hawking and Eric Clapton.  Dylan had the third<br/>\nhighest score and the highest of the kids, who were all older and in<br/>\npublic school.   We can attribute most of what he knew to the Simpsons<br/>\nand other TV shows and at least one answer to popcorn.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62147,"nextTopicId":62128}}
