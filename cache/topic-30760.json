When my family asked why last Christmas we had left so early, I told them about the TV.  We discussed it in a positive way and this year was much better.  So no, it is not that we have no more to say, although we did ask my bil why he wasn&#39;t very talkative at Christmas since he was ready to change the world at Thanksgiving.  As you might have guessed, I like to talk, especially about things that require a little thought.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Sarah Carothers <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Monday, January 07, 2002 11:23 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] TV question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPat,<br/>\nI wonder....<br/>\ncould it be that your family has exchanged all the funny stories and so on<br/>\nat your Thanksgiving dinner and then just three weeks later, you&#39;re all back<br/>\ntogether again with no new storeis to tell? <br/>\n<br/>\nor could it be that Thanksgiving doesn&#39;t usually require as much energy as<br/>\nxmas?

These are adults as well as children and none of them have any restrictions so this does not speak to the debate going on about the merits of not restricting TV.  My sister has the family over for Christmas, I have the family over for Thanksgiving.  When we get together at my house, the TV does not go on and everyone sits around talking or we play a group game after dinner.  I find it very enjoyable.  At my sister&#39;s house when we arrive, everyone is sitting around watching a movie on the big screen TV and there is barely any acknowledgement that we have arrived.  After dinner, the TV goes back on and people either fall asleep or zone out.  I don&#39;t enjoy it.  Unfortunately we only see each other 3 or 4 times a year so I want to interact.  Along a similar line, When children come to our house, they play non-stop until it is time for them to go home.  My kids rarely like to go to other kids houses because they say it is boring.  The same kids that play non-stop here, will go off and play Nintendo or something anti-social at their own house.  Maybe I am the one with the problem here but sheesh, if I want to watch TV I can do that alone.  Do any of you have similar problems? <br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30771,"nextTopicId":30774}}
