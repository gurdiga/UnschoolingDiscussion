I feel that way even though one of my children <br/>\ngoes to school, we are still an unschooling family. I feel this way, because <br/>\nhe choose to go to school, he loves being there and he knows he will always <br/>\nhave that choice. I don&#39;t have the early morning battles over getting up, <br/>\neating... and all that. He loves going. My daughter on the other hand, hated <br/>\ngetting up, resisted eating so early in the morning... since we changed to a <br/>\nmore child-led lifestyle last year, our lives have been much smoother. This <br/>\nis not to say that my children make all the decisions, and my husband and I <br/>\njust stand by and let it happen. If I think its time to do something, or go <br/>\nsomewhere, we do so. My kids don&#39;t get to say no, they are too young to be <br/>\nleft alone. If one of my children were to say &quot;Im not going to do the dishes <br/>\ntoday, I am going to do something else.&quot; this is not acceptable as they both <br/>\nhave to participate in daily living activities that benefit the family as a <br/>\nwhole. But should my daughter say &quot;I don&#39;t want tuna for lunch&quot;, even though <br/>\nI had fixed it, I would tell her she is welcome to fix something else, <br/>\nwhereas a year ago I would have told her &quot;Im not a short order cook, I fixed <br/>\ntuna, we are having tuna.&quot; I think being an unschooler is one thing, letting <br/>\nthat part of your life into other aspects of you life can take some courage. <br/>\nWe have found it easy to do this, for the most part. I just couldn&#39;t see <br/>\nunschooling becoming an all encompassing part of our lives.

I&#39;m sorry if I made you repeat yourself, but <br/>\nyou have given me a clearer picture of what you&#39;ve been trying to say.<br/>\nI think I am sensative(and maybe others too) to the idea of asking <br/>\nfor anything schooly to be done because it would be,for me, a major <br/>\nslip in my growth into unschooling.  Like was said in another post <br/>\nfrom you, we are coming at this from different perspectives.  I think <br/>\nit would be helpful to remember that many people come at this <br/>\nphilosophy, fighting the urge to control their childrens learning.  <br/>\nSo many are around them, doing the &quot;school&quot; thing, and this is a <br/>\nplace to come where you can be reminded that children don&#39;t need <br/>\nthat. Infact, seem to benefit greatly without that.  For some people, <br/>\nthat is way easier to see than others.  It is way easier for me now, <br/>\nthan it was a year or two ago.  <br/>\nAnyway, I hope this explains a little of the strife here.<br/>\nJoanna :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., Bridget E Coffman <br/>\n&lt;rumpleteasermom@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Or at the very least, that you expect NOTHING from them.

Yes there are some things<br/>\nconsidered (by those who differentiate) schoolwork on our jobs list.  The<br/>\nlist was worked out by all of us together and was working great.  My<br/>\ngirls asked for a little more &#39;guidance&#39; with schoolwork.  I gave them<br/>\nthe bare minimum of suggestion.  Things like do a science experiment or<br/>\nwrite something.  The list is always up for revision.  If anyone is<br/>\nunhappy with any part of it, it is up for discussion (well not the<br/>\ndishes).  <br/>\nBut my point here has less to do with how our family &#39;works&#39; and more to<br/>\ndo with the fact that we have been over this repeatedly and I am still<br/>\nbeing told that I &#39;require&#39; writing.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I believe that was the point of contention. Not housework.<br/>\n&gt; To me there is a difference in requiring my children to do chores  and <br/>\n&gt; help out our family in our everyday lives, and requiring them to <br/>\n&gt; learn thing that I believe are important to know.  The former deals <br/>\n&gt; with the immediate ( a livable environment, a sane mother ;-/, <br/>\n&gt; respect for each other and their things....,) the latter has nothing  <br/>\n&gt; to do with me personally and I would feel hugely invasive, and wrong  <br/>\n&gt; if I tried to make my children practice writing or math or ....as if <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I NEVER tell them what to learn or think or believe.  The only parts of<br/>\ntheir lives that I have a definitive &#39;say&#39; over are the parts that affect<br/>\nus all - things like &quot;No Rachel, your painting project can&#39;t tie up the<br/>\ndining room table indefinitely - put it on the porch table please.&quot; <br/>\nOf course that is why I have one witch, one militant agnostic one<br/>\npantheist and one undecided living here with me, the tree worshipper<br/>\n(Druids - we don&#39;t worship the trees, we worship WITH the trees.)  I<br/>\nbelieve it is their right to decide what they believe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you deny that you require certain school type stuff from <br/>\n&gt;  your children, even if it is part of a larger choice?(your list, as <br/>\n&gt; I  recall).   Simply by putting writing on that list implies an <br/>\n&gt; importance to you, and a mistrust that writing will be learned, <br/>\n&gt; because your children will, on their own, come to see it as a vital <br/>\n&gt; part of their lives.(or not, and therefore don&#39;t really need to do <br/>\n&gt; much of it).  Requiring anything implies a mistrust in the person to <br/>\n&gt;  do it on their own(as I have done with my children and my household <br/>\n&gt; rules),  If I ever extend that into areas of their education, I <br/>\n&gt; would  no longer consider myself an unschooling parent.<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s my take on it.<br/>\n&gt; Joanna<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t deny that there are suggections for &#39;schoolwork&#39; on the list.  I<br/>\ndo deny that it is MY list.  It is OUR list.  And as for what is tied to<br/>\nit, Jenni has never had any problems with the household stuff.  Rachel<br/>\nhas some medical problems and when she gets to doing nothing, the list is<br/>\nan acurate indicator that she needs help - either help avoiding allergens<br/>\nor a medication adjustment.  When Rachel is out of whack physically, she<br/>\nlooses my mothers car.  The list just tells us when that is happening so<br/>\nwe can catch it earlier.<br/>\nAs for overseeing their &#39;education&#39;, I wish . . .  I am sick to death of<br/>\nhearing about hydraulic brakes and locomotive wheel bases, but I still<br/>\nhave to feign interest anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I explained before, the list is not about me imposing MY household<br/>\nrules on them.  It is about the fact that my husband could not<br/>\ndisassociate himself from certain things.  I sat down with the girls and<br/>\ntalked about what needed done and why it was unfair to expect him to keep<br/>\ndoing it.  The list just defines what has to get done without his help.<br/>\nIt is as much for his benefit as any of the rest of us.  It just works<br/>\nbackwards for him.   He in not allowed to do anything on the list<br/>\n(generally - there have been exceptions) when he gets home from a 10 hour<br/>\nday at work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t care if you don&#39;t want to consider us unschoolers or not.  At<br/>\nthis point I think I would like to NOT be confused with the few here who<br/>\nkeep attacking my home life, so maybe I prefer not to be called that at<br/>\nthis point.  But the one thing I can say for sure is that I am tired of<br/>\nexplaining the same things over and over again as if I have not said it<br/>\nbefore.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - They KNOW how to string words together.  The suggestion arose<br/>\nbecause Rachel wants to go to college in the spring and I think (from<br/>\npersonal experience) that it would be helpful if she got used to writing<br/>\nnow.  (Physically writing - you know as in taking notes and writing<br/>\ntests.)  So we put it on the list.  She has, to my knowledge written a<br/>\nfew things but not much.  In three weeks or so, I think I&#39;ve seen one<br/>\npage.<br/>\n<br/>\nPPS - Someone else said they don&#39;t call it a &#39;chore&#39; it is just something<br/>\nthey can do together.  That attitude would get a hearty laugh here.  My<br/>\ngirls have a great sense of wordplay.  I suspect if I told them about<br/>\nthat, they would decide to start calling all chores &quot;Fred&quot; or &quot;Albert&quot;. <br/>\nAs in &quot;Who&#39;s doing that Fred today?&quot;  They are firm believers in  &quot;A rose<br/>\nwould smell as sweet by any other name.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~<br/>\nThink like a man of action, act like a man of thought<br/>\n<br/>\n                     - Henri Bergson</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"9KUmGl7gPWav8qS0JjEVOP5hDDd_0U5O0R3QVBD_6nvrU5gE9nYBBXOi1t9dhTfcLzEb6dsgBi5X","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] unschooling","postDate":"1000818923","msgId":25917,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRiLjExNDQ1MmQ3LjI4ZDhhMmViQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":25916,"nextInTopic":25928,"prevInTime":25916,"nextInTime":25918,"topicId":2152,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/17/01 9:38:55 PM, wew99@sssnet.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-85075070\">In a message dated 9/17/01 9:38:55 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wew99@...\">wew99@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Now, what would I do if I had a 15 year old that wanted to get married or <br/>\ngo<br/>\nin to the illegal drug business?

Or the entire disucssion was a<br/>\nmisunderstanding about what people were saying was not unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI pulled the quotes from your original message that were being objected to.<br/>\nThey were about *academics*. You didn&#39;t explain (despite the fact that I<br/>\nposted them twice and asked twice) how it could be child-led, uncoerced,<br/>\nnatural learning if you&#39;re determining that a specific amount must be done<br/>\nin order for the learning to take place. I *understand* that you have this<br/>\non your chores chart. I *understand* you put it there for convenience sake.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for those trying to understand how kids can learn what *they* need to<br/>\nknow (as opposed to what others say they need to know) by pursuing what<br/>\ninterests them, it is confusing if someone says it&#39;s unschooling to insist<br/>\nthat something needs to be learned in a particular way.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, an unschooling approach would be to give a child information she&#39;s<br/>\nlacking in order to make an informed choice. For instance, let her know that<br/>\ncolleges *may* expect more writing than she&#39;s used to. (It really depends on<br/>\nthe college and the course of study she pursues.) She may or may not feel<br/>\nthat&#39;s a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she does, there are many ways to approach it. She could take a community<br/>\ncollege course. She could find a program and go through it on her own. She<br/>\ncould post to message boards. She could find pen pals. She could write in a<br/>\njournal. She could write articles for the local paper. She could write to<br/>\nsome students at the colleges she&#39;s thinking of and *ask* how much writing<br/>\nis involved. (Colleges generally have some students who volunteer to host<br/>\nothers.) Or other options. She could ask mom to remind her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf *she* insists writing 500 words each week is the best approach and *she*<br/>\ninsists she needs someone to *make* her do it each week and punish her if<br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t, then that&#39;s an area to discuss.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be motherly (or following your heart or &quot;common sense&quot; or whatever<br/>\nyou&#39;d care to label it nor not label it) to insist it is a problem and she<br/>\nneeds to do something about it. And if someone wants to do that, then they<br/>\nshould do that. But it&#39;s unfair to others trying to understand unschooling<br/>\nto call it unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be unschooling to know that she&#39;s the best judge of who she is and<br/>\nwhat *she* needs and to know that she needs to make the decisions that feel<br/>\nright for her. If she later finds out the decision had consequences she<br/>\nhadn&#39;t anticipated, then she&#39;s learned something else and can then reassess<br/>\nthe problem and seek a new solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way to learn to write is by writing for real, personally meaningful<br/>\nreasons. If the kids aren&#39;t writing without someone reminding them, then it<br/>\nisn&#39;t real or personally meaningful to them. It may be a &quot;chore&quot; they choose<br/>\nover cleaning the toilet, but it isn&#39;t child led learning anymore than<br/>\nchoosing an apple over dog food is child-led eating.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way to write a lot is by having real deadlines for real reasons.<br/>\nShe&#39;ll be getting those (sort of) in college. (Only sort of because the<br/>\nconsequences are all made up. Unlike in the business world, neither the<br/>\nworld nor the college will be a better or worse place if a paper is or isn&#39;t<br/>\nturned in. Colleges have to make up consequences -- grades -- so that there<br/>\nare consequences to doing or not doing homework.) There will be a real<br/>\nreason for doing the writing to a certain standard and she will have full<br/>\nfreedom to do it or not do it, knowing the consequences are not negotiable.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, anyway, writing as a chore is even further removed from real actions<br/>\nbeing tied to real consequences since the chore consequences don&#39;t depend<br/>\nspecifically on the writing. The purpose of writing should be to communicate<br/>\nsomething to someone else for a real reason. (As I&#39;m doing here.) Not to<br/>\nfulfill a word limit. The consequences of writing well or not writing well<br/>\nare not gaining or losing car privileges (or whatever) but communicating or<br/>\nnot communicating. Writing in order to get 500 words onto the page won&#39;t<br/>\nhave the same result as writing because *the writer wants* to change<br/>\nsomeone&#39;s mind about something, or tell them something they didn&#39;t know<br/>\nbefore.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, here&#39;s the quotes:<br/>\n<br/>\nthe word &quot;MY&quot; in &quot;as long as it meets my basic standards of HOW MUCH.&quot; (in<br/>\nreference to writing each week.)<br/>\n<br/>\nthe words &quot;have to&quot; in &quot;they have to write (physically)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there was another quote a few days later that said your daughter<br/>\n(paraphrasing since I&#39;ve emptied my deleted items folder) &quot;had to get used<br/>\nto writing this much in college each week.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"r0SLivNm44iS2ca1LgyqmMndX7kcJxVl8pLP3mzWJ_7jEM7KXvZFzuz-w0gLyiPzcQGsSUgFXtyTEm3alZ8aipiyUInt5oB-6Qs","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: parenting  vs unschooling Re:  [Unschooling-dotcom]unschooling","postDate":"1000790807","msgId":25946,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAxMDkxNzIyMjEzNi4wMGE1ODdiMEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDEwOTE3MjI1NTQ3Ljk5NjkyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MzExLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAxMDkxNzEwMjgxMi4wMGE2ZmQ5MEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+"},"prevInTopic":25945,"nextInTopic":25951,"prevInTime":25945,"nextInTime":25947,"topicId":2152,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I don&#39;t see this as the <br/>\nlogical end to my own parenting method. I believe my son (and generally any <br/>\nchild) naturally wants to help, be a part of, etc. Sure there are times when <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t want to do stuff, there are times when I don&#39;t either. And <br/>\nsometimes, it&#39;s ok. I think when I push myself or my son too hard without <br/>\nsome just do nothing time is when we see more resistance.

Isn&#39;t it great when something like this happens?<br/>\nMy 12yr old dd has been out of ps since last may and is very <br/>\nunmotivated.  Yesterday I bought this *Who dunnit* project pack.  She <br/>\nsaw this among the shopping and looked at it with interest. We then <br/>\nspent the next 3 hours (at her request) trying to discover *who <br/>\ndunnit*.  You have to solve all the clues to be able to do this - the <br/>\nclues include maths = games - map reading  - lots of reading.  Some <br/>\nof the clues were really quite hard.  We did not get the right <br/>\nanswere - but we did have a lot of fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, dare i say, I think I&#39;ve got it!!<br/>\n<br/>\nmarianne</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Anita Bower","from":"Anita Bower &lt;homequaker@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Wwjx09hez0F_2r1vTK5WtgWYqSf7HVfOinRwKg93Sy2FXkz6zWr7sq8-v_EuN6XMrKd8W7u4Yf-FSWdJpMuSB4hJGu6PMDCD8xFTVvqk","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"unschooling","postDate":"955712238","msgId":8123,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMuMC42LjMyLjIwMDAwNDE0MDczNzE4LjAwOWMwYjAwQHRyb3V0LmJyYW5keXdpbmUubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":2152,"nextInTopic":15612,"prevInTime":8122,"nextInTime":8124,"topicId":2152,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am an unschooler that periodically gets worried and imposes some academic requirements (other than reading, which we do daily and is a joy for all).

We<br/>\nspent time most days working through &quot;Scoring High&quot; in preparation of the<br/>\ntest--both to learn test-taking skills and cover material we might not have<br/>\ntouched upon (turned out to be a quick way of learning some grammar).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, having taken the test, I am back to letting my son do what he wants<br/>\n(except--no &quot;screen time&quot; until my nap in the afternoon).  I am<br/>\nrediscovering the joys of unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is pursuing  his various interests:  Roller Coaster Tycoon,<br/>\ncarpentry, Little League, Karate, riding his dirt bike, listening to us<br/>\nread aloud, mowing our large yard, taking care of his chickens, and<br/>\nstarting a mowing business (he has one customer).  He is also asking<br/>\ninteresting questions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am enjoying my role as facilitator.  I get info on the various questions<br/>\nhe asks: &quot;Why do most pictures of teeth show two roots but his baby teeth<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have any?&quot;--this led to reading about teeth and doing an experiment<br/>\nwith eggs.  &quot;What is the difference between hail and snow?&quot; This led to a<br/>\nfamily discussion and looking up many references until we felt we<br/>\nunderstood the basic differences.  &quot;How can I catch bass in our pond?&quot;  We<br/>\nwent to the library, found a couple of excellent books on fishing, he<br/>\ntalked with 2 friends about fishing and what lures, etc. to use, we have<br/>\ngone fishing.  &quot;I wish I could draw better.&quot;  We attended &quot;Art all Morning&quot;<br/>\nand he learned some pointers for drawing faces.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are having a wonderful time.  I am reminded, as I need to be time and<br/>\nagain, that my son is naturally curious and that much will be learned by<br/>\npursuing his interests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to read about other&#39;s experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnita  <br/>\n&quot;There are many will claim to tell you what is due from you, but only one<br/>\nwho can shear through the many, and reach the truth.
