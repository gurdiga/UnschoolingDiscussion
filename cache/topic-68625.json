I&#39;ve always believed in beneficial neglect for my son Alex, now 5 and 1/2 (who just lost his first tooth!) When he wants time with me, he tells me and when he wants to do his own thing, he just wanders away till he wants to come back. We have a very slow pace of life here and lots of yard enclosed by a safe fence and I just love that he can go by himself to the sandbox and build for an hour. He loves it too.I think it gives him a chance to think his own thoughts and figure stuff out on his own. And when something cool happens, he comes running in excited to show me. Solitude is great for me too.
