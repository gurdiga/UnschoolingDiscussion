They require study in <br/>\naviation and aviation history.  Once their first stripe is earned <br/>\n(this requires a physical test and mutilple choice test), they can <br/>\nprepare and get a gliders license.  They also do o-flights (I think <br/>\nthat&#39;s the right name) and they go up in private planes like a <br/>\nCessna, with the pilot and two Cadets in each plane.  They will land <br/>\nat two different airports and hopefully get a chance to take over the <br/>\ncontrols for a little while.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m a bit worried that it may be too regimented for him, being <br/>\n </span></blockquote>associated with the military and all.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes he like anything about the military?  I would say my <br/>\nson,too,hates anything regimented, but he enjoys the Civil Air <br/>\nPatrol.  They do make them learn all the &quot;about face&quot; stuff and are <br/>\nquite strict about their appearance.  You can always find your local <br/>\nunit and try it.  They require you to attend at least three or four <br/>\nmeeting before you make your final decision.  They may vary from one <br/>\ngroup to the next, I am not sure.  They are an auxillary of the Air <br/>\nForce.  They do a lot of community service such as crowd control for <br/>\nair shows and traffic control for local events and for the BIG <br/>\nfirework shore on the fourth.  They have a CAP t-shirt that he would <br/>\nhave to wear if he joined, until he was there long enough to get his <br/>\nBDU (Basic Dress Uniform) and after six months gets to wear his Dress <br/>\nBlues. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"lbergfam@msn.com","from":"lbergfam@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"9E_lXoAbN-HTfn6ldj5Bfh6iXJKri9RLvuzL4TgZj45XDaO8RG_aCf5apKh-hL0TbOarMD8ugw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Pop Warner Football","postDate":"997207328","msgId":23004,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlrcGFmMCs1YzlmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23132,"prevInTime":23003,"nextInTime":23005,"topicId":23004,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Laura, What can you tell me about the Civil Air Patrol?
