Who *begins* a conversation this way?  Even I at my worst have <br/>\nnever *started* in such a curt, preemptory way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I&#39;m running from, running toward respect and <br/>\nsaying, &quot;Could you let me know when you have a break so I can ask you <br/>\nsomething?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, late, Fisher (6) lost a battle in his Pokemon GameCube <br/>\ngame.  He ended up losing a rare Pokemon because he had forgotten to <br/>\nsave before the battle.  He cried off and on for two hours (we ended <br/>\nup going to bed at 1 a.m.)  I knew he was overtired, and just <br/>\nmentioned to him that he might feel better about it in the morning.  <br/>\nBut instead of insisting that he turn it off or go to bed or stop <br/>\ncrying or just shut up and play until he got the Pokemon again, I <br/>\nwaited to see what he wanted to do.  Sometimes I played for him while <br/>\nhe was waiting to get that Pokemon again, going through some of the <br/>\nmore repetitive battles.  I brought him snacks to keep his energy <br/>\nup.  I rubbed his back and talked to him when he felt like talking -- <br/>\nwhen he was too upset to talk, I backed off.  At one point he was up <br/>\nin his room, but I asked if he wanted to keep me company in the <br/>\nkitchen while I cleaned up, and he took me up on it.  He showed me a <br/>\nlot of the game while we did that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time we went to bed, he was smiling and okay again.  Still <br/>\nvery disappointed (he never did get that Pokemon back) but I could <br/>\ntell he felt like I was on his side, and it helped a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I think &quot;How can I help Fisher get what he wants?&quot; everything <br/>\nabout parenting seems to fall into place.  I suppose it&#39;s more work, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s easier because I know what the work is about and it&#39;s work <br/>\ntoward a good relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus on the Family isn&#39;t going to show me that.  Mothers who don&#39;t <br/>\nlet their children play with neighborhood kids, ever, aren&#39;t going to <br/>\nshow me that.

It shows a boy pretending to shave, with shaving <br/>\ncreme and a comb.  The cover blurb is &quot;Raising Right-Minded Rascals.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRight away, it seemed disrespectful of boys.  &quot;Rascals&quot; might be a term of <br/>\nendearment, but it&#39;s not positive.  The issue was largely an advertisement for a <br/>\nseries of videos called &quot;Bringing Up Boys.&quot;  It was pro-leadership and <br/>\nanti-homosexuality (&quot;Teaching that homosexuality is genetic is one of the biggest <br/>\ndeceptions taught in schools today.  Two former homosexuals testify of their <br/>\nturn from homosexuality and it origins&quot; and one tape is all about the role <br/>\nparents have in preventing homosexuality.)   But that&#39;s not what I wanted to bring <br/>\nto the list, it&#39;s just the tone of this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a short article, though, called Backing Down Back Talk (&quot;featuring <br/>\nDr. James Dobson,&quot; who is quoted but didn&#39;t write it, and there isn&#39;t an author <br/>\ncredit).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to quote some.  Were the question put to this list, the answers <br/>\nwould have been MUCH much different.<br/>\n<br/>\n======<br/>\n<br/>\nKids can say the cutest thins.  but not everything coming out of etheir <br/>\nmouths is sugar and spiec.  Sometimes their syllables can sizle. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out a scene between a mom and her precocious 7-year-old:<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda:  Tess, get in here and clear your breaflast dishes.<br/>\n<br/>\nTess:  Just  a minute, Mom.  I&#39;m watching television.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda:  No, right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nTess:  I said, in a minute!<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda: And I said right now!<br/>\n<br/>\nTess:  (stomping into kitchen):  HUMPH!  You&#39;re such a pain, mom.  Why can&#39;t <br/>\nyou let me do what I want?<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda:  Because I&#39;m your mom.  It&#39;s my job to help you do the right thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTess:  That&#39;s not a REAL job.  Why can&#39;t you get a job like vicki&#39;s mom?<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda:  Because I&#39;m YOUR mom.  I&#39;m supposed to make your life miserable.<br/>\n<br/>\nTess:  I am miserable.  Thanks to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a scale of one to 10, how d you think Linda handled the situation?  <br/>\n(Cheesy game show music.)<br/>\nBUZZ!  Got your answer?<br/>\n<br/>\nDr.  James Dobson says Linda needs to discourage the disrespectful behavior <br/>\nnow--before it gets worse.  He might give her a three.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo they&#39;re not recommending it as an ideal conversation, but are they <br/>\nsuggesting the mother could have been more respectful and patient?  No.   The <br/>\nreecommendation is this:<br/>\n&quot;By punishing disrepectful talk now, Linda will help squelch battles in the <br/>\nteen years before they start.  Added chores, a spanking or being grounded from <br/>\nthe television may be a good reminder for Tess to treat her mom better.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------end of quotes-------<br/>\n<br/>\nI used caps to show where they used italics.<br/>\nThere was more, about trying to understand a child&#39;s viewpoint and being big <br/>\nenough to apologize, and helping them find ways to communicate.  But there was <br/>\nNO criticism of a mother saying &quot;get in here and...&quot; or &quot;no, right now.&quot;  The <br/>\nmother is assumed right.   &quot;But if you feel your actions were correct, you <br/>\nshould explain your reaction and what you expect next time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTelling children what you expect, with the threat of &quot;added chores, a <br/>\nspanking or being grounded from the television&quot; is not respectful of children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91876,"nextTopicId":91859}}
