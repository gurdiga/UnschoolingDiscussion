It helps them begin <br/>\nto think of others less fortunate, as well as clearing out the surplus of <br/>\nstuff accumulated.With the things I know we are keeping, I have put up lots <br/>\nof floor-ceiling bookshelves.  Then I fill up baskets and contact paper <br/>\ncovered boxes with the &quot;stuff&quot;.  Also, I ran across an idea in a magazine <br/>\nwhere they made 2 pc fabric covered ottomans for the living room that could <br/>\nbe filled with toys, papers and magazines.  They look like large hat boxes!)  <br/>\nSomething I have started doing this year , is in the kid&#39;s rooms, we are <br/>\nputting up shelves  about a foot below where the ceiling and wall meets (up <br/>\nhigh on the walls) with decorative brackets, and we are storing old toys, <br/>\nstuffed animals, trophies, etc .  It makes a good place to put things that <br/>\nare rarely played with, yet wanted to  be kept.  Hope some of this  helps, <br/>\nStella.
