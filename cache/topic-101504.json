But you really don&#39;t need a starter <br/>\n  culture or a machine.  You can easily make your own yogurt using a <br/>\n  commercial brand yogurt as a starter.  I&#39;ve done this, and it makes <br/>\n  a fine yogurt, but a little on the thin side.  I use the recipe and <br/>\n  instructions from &quot;The Encyclopedia of Country Living&quot; by Carla <br/>\n  Emery.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Start by pasteurizing one quart milk by heating it to 150 F-<br/>\n  degrees.  Cool milk to 110 F-degrees.  I use organic whole milk.  If <br/>\n  you like really thick yogurt (the pudding-like kind), add about 1/4 <br/>\n  cup of powdered milk to the quart milk and mix well before heating.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you start from store-bought yogurt, make it an unflavored, <br/>\n  additive-free one.  Stoneyfield Farms is a good organic one, but <br/>\n  some people swear that Dannon unflavored makes the best yogurt <br/>\n  starter.  Once the milk has cooled to 110F, add 2 tablespoons of <br/>\n  yogurt to the milk.  Stir gently and completely, but don&#39;t whisk.  <br/>\n  Pour the mix into small, clean jars and cover loosely.  I use old <br/>\n  glass peanut butter jars because they have nice wide mouths.  Set <br/>\n  the jars in a warm place for several hours.  The mix needs to be <br/>\n  kept warm, as close to the 110F as possible.  An oven set at 150 <br/>\n  degrees, or an insulated cooler with a heating pad inside with the <br/>\n  jars will do fine.  Try not to jostle or move the jars while the mix <br/>\n  is setting.  Once it&#39;s cultured, refridgerate for about 12 hours, <br/>\n  and it&#39;s done.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Save about 1/4 cup of your first batch, and keep it sealed <br/>\n  separately in the refridgerator.  You want to keep it as fresh as <br/>\n  possible, because it will be the starter for your next batch.  But <br/>\n  you should really use it within a week.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We use a LOT of yogurt, and this has saved me a lot of money.  Once <br/>\n  the yogurt is done, I add some honey to the yogurt I&#39;ll be using for <br/>\n  fruit smoothies.  The other yogurt I leave plain, and I use that in <br/>\n  baking and cooking.  I buy all-fruit butters from a local supplier, <br/>\n  and my kids add whatever flavor they want to their yogurt.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My goodness, this got long.  I hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Debbie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

This is fine, and I&#39;m<br/>\n  just glad they&#39;re getting enough sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The problem is that I wake up early in the morning, between 5:00<br/>\n  a.m. and 6:00 a.m., and I need to go to sleep by 10:00 p.m.,<br/>\n  sometimes as early as 9:00 p.m. if we&#39;ve had a really physically<br/>\n  active day.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Many times dd-R. and ds-R. want to start games or discussions, or<br/>\n  start watching a movie together (meaning with *me*) at 9:00 p.m.,<br/>\n  and I have such trouble concentrating.  It disappoints them and me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve explained my sleep needs to R. and R., and I&#39;ve asked that we<br/>\n  schedule stuff for earlier in the evening, but it seems that they<br/>\n  have a burst of energy right around 9:00 p.m., just as my energy is<br/>\n  sputtering to a stop.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have the most energy early in the morning and throughout the<br/>\n  morning, and my kids have the opposite.

So one day I sought HIM out at 11, <br/>\ntold him we&#39;d watch a movie together THEN I&#39;d go in my own bed.  What a <br/>\nhappy compromise!  I&#39;ve not said that line again, he&#39;s not had to be sad <br/>\nand missing his mama, and we get some time together.  Hannah (8) is <br/>\nhappy to fall asleep between 10-11 and get up around 9 am; it&#39;s a sign <br/>\nof their love when she is staying up really late with him [lately it&#39;s <br/>\nbeen to do christmas letters while I&#39;m not around] and truly enjoying it. <br/>\nLast night, I pooped out at 12:30 and began &quot;closing up&quot; by turning off <br/>\nextra lights, blowing out candles, etc... Hannah asked to have the <br/>\nlights ON and as I breathed in for my speil, she stopped me by offering <br/>\nto take care of the lights herself.  They both came upstairs a few <br/>\nminutes later, I heard all the lights turning off, they closed my <br/>\nbedroom door and their own... Hannah came in to sleep with me an hour <br/>\nlater and it looks like Hayden fell asleep to Looney Tunes, Back in <br/>\nAction &lt;bg&gt; <br/>\n:) diana<br/>\n<br/>\nmyfunny4 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;My kids, dd-15 and ds-12, like to stay up until 11:00 p.m. or <br/>\n&gt;midnight, and sleep until 9:00 a.m. or later.

I&#39;m available from <br/>\nwhen they get up through early evening for pretty much anything they want.  I <br/>\ntake them places, <br/>\nwe watch our favorite shows, we play games etc.  If I do stay up late we <br/>\nsometimes all watch a movie or play a game together.  Mornings I have my time to <br/>\nwork out or get on the computer before they get up.  It&#39;s been a gradual <br/>\nprocess but it seems to be working out for everyone.  I get my rest and they have <br/>\nthe evenings to do other things that interest them.  I do miss some things but <br/>\nthey understand I&#39;m in a much better frame of mind the next day if I&#39;ve had the <br/>\nsleep I need.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we&#39;ll watch a movie the next day that they have already seen the <br/>\nnight before.
