Not only do we have the upset reactions from<br/>\n&gt; new people but we have lots of people jumping on others for upsetting<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n&gt; Anyone who can&#39;t pick up obvious clues like that is probably dead and not<br/>\n&gt; offering advice here anyway. ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That different people need to receive different advice is obvious and no<br/>\none<br/>\n&gt; is disputing that. The problem is how to deal with it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do we offer only advice that is guaranteed nonthreatening and then slowly<br/>\n&gt; offer more and more difficult stuff up to someone&#39;s tolerance level? And<br/>\nhow<br/>\n&gt; would we &quot;train&quot; everyone who wants to give advice in how to do that? A<br/>\n&gt; dozen different readers can interpret the same thing in a dozen different<br/>\n&gt; ways.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do we somehow read someoene&#39;s mind and figure out they aren&#39;t quite ready<br/>\n&gt; for the hard questions yet and just give them the advice they want to<br/>\nhear?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (And what if their comfort point is being assured that what they are doing<br/>\n&gt; is fine when it isn&#39;t unschooling? It may be fine in the great scheme of<br/>\n&gt; things but why would someone *specifically* need to seek out unschooler --<br/>\n&gt; not fellow homeschoolers but *unschoolers* -- to reassure them what they<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; doing is fine?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or, like a library, do we offer them what they are asking for and let<br/>\n*them*<br/>\n&gt; pick and choose what they find useful and discard what they don&#39;t? And<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt; of those who are reading who need a different style of advice?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have all heard loud and clear that some people feel attacked by certain<br/>\n&gt; styles of advice. I think two things are being missed:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The ones who interpret the hard advice as attack are not *just* being<br/>\n&gt; offered hard advice. They *are* being offered a variety but they&#39;re taking<br/>\n&gt; exception to the fact that some of it is not to their liking.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The people who have spoken up and said they *needed* the harder type of<br/>\n&gt; advice for them to get unschooling. They don&#39;t get hurt and angry because<br/>\n&gt; some of the advice is soft. (Nor should they!) They just take what&#39;s<br/>\nuseful<br/>\n&gt; to them and leave what isn&#39;t. And if the advice gets limited to soft<br/>\nthey&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; just have a vague sense that this list isn&#39;t meeting their needs and leave<br/>\n&gt; without a big grandstanding fuss. The effect of losing people will be<br/>\n&gt; *exactly* the same. The difference is we won&#39;t have to be upset by the<br/>\nfact<br/>\n&gt; that we did something to make them leave because we won&#39;t even be aware of<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s also helpful to keep in mind that this advice that upsets<br/>\n&gt; people *isn&#39;t* intended to hurt them. It *isn&#39;t* hate literature we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; offering people in our library. It&#39;s perfectly fine literature that some<br/>\n&gt; people love and some people find objectionable. *And* we&#39;re offering them<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; variety to choose from. Some people are just getting upset that the stuff<br/>\n&gt; they deem objectionable is being offered at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, what to do?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rather than censor or control advice or advice givers, I think helping new<br/>\n&gt; people be better informed is a better -- a more democratic and unschooling<br/>\n&gt; ;-) -- answer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But how to deliver the information? In an introductory letter? If people<br/>\n&gt; read them. :-/ (But if they don&#39;t, it isn&#39;t the lists fault!) A monthly<br/>\n&gt; reminder on the list is probably annoying and impersonal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I like what Pam said:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Some of the advice you get here might challenge you, shock you, disturb<br/>\n&gt; you, or seem harsh. But remember that people are offering it to be helpful<br/>\n&gt; and what feels uncomfortable to you might be just what someone else needed<br/>\n&gt; to hear. If you don&#39;t like the way someone says something, ignore it. If<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; disagree with the content of what they say, offer your own alternative<br/>\n&gt; ideas.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (Just thinking out loud there.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any sensitive types who are afraid to post because you don&#39;t want attacked<br/>\n&gt; want to comment?

Not only do we have the upset reactions from<br/>\nnew people but we have lots of people jumping on others for upsetting them.<br/>\nAnyone who can&#39;t pick up obvious clues like that is probably dead and not<br/>\noffering advice here anyway. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat different people need to receive different advice is obvious and no one<br/>\nis disputing that. The problem is how to deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo we offer only advice that is guaranteed nonthreatening and then slowly<br/>\noffer more and more difficult stuff up to someone&#39;s tolerance level? And how<br/>\nwould we &quot;train&quot; everyone who wants to give advice in how to do that? A<br/>\ndozen different readers can interpret the same thing in a dozen different<br/>\nways.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo we somehow read someoene&#39;s mind and figure out they aren&#39;t quite ready<br/>\nfor the hard questions yet and just give them the advice they want to hear?<br/>\n<br/>\n(And what if their comfort point is being assured that what they are doing<br/>\nis fine when it isn&#39;t unschooling? It may be fine in the great scheme of<br/>\nthings but why would someone *specifically* need to seek out unschooler --<br/>\nnot fellow homeschoolers but *unschoolers* -- to reassure them what they are<br/>\ndoing is fine?)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, like a library, do we offer them what they are asking for and let *them*<br/>\npick and choose what they find useful and discard what they don&#39;t? And what<br/>\nof those who are reading who need a different style of advice?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have all heard loud and clear that some people feel attacked by certain<br/>\nstyles of advice. I think two things are being missed:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ones who interpret the hard advice as attack are not *just* being<br/>\noffered hard advice. They *are* being offered a variety but they&#39;re taking<br/>\nexception to the fact that some of it is not to their liking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people who have spoken up and said they *needed* the harder type of<br/>\nadvice for them to get unschooling. They don&#39;t get hurt and angry because<br/>\nsome of the advice is soft. (Nor should they!) They just take what&#39;s useful<br/>\nto them and leave what isn&#39;t. And if the advice gets limited to soft they&#39;ll<br/>\njust have a vague sense that this list isn&#39;t meeting their needs and leave<br/>\nwithout a big grandstanding fuss. The effect of losing people will be<br/>\n*exactly* the same. The difference is we won&#39;t have to be upset by the fact<br/>\nthat we did something to make them leave because we won&#39;t even be aware of<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s also helpful to keep in mind that this advice that upsets<br/>\npeople *isn&#39;t* intended to hurt them. It *isn&#39;t* hate literature we&#39;re<br/>\noffering people in our library. It&#39;s perfectly fine literature that some<br/>\npeople love and some people find objectionable. *And* we&#39;re offering them a<br/>\nvariety to choose from. Some people are just getting upset that the stuff<br/>\nthey deem objectionable is being offered at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than censor or control advice or advice givers, I think helping new<br/>\npeople be better informed is a better -- a more democratic and unschooling<br/>\n;-) -- answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut how to deliver the information? In an introductory letter? If people<br/>\nread them. :-/ (But if they don&#39;t, it isn&#39;t the lists fault!) A monthly<br/>\nreminder on the list is probably annoying and impersonal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like what Pam said:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Some of the advice you get here might challenge you, shock you, disturb<br/>\nyou, or seem harsh. But remember that people are offering it to be helpful<br/>\nand what feels uncomfortable to you might be just what someone else needed<br/>\nto hear. If you don&#39;t like the way someone says something, ignore it. If you<br/>\ndisagree with the content of what they say, offer your own alternative<br/>\nideas.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(Just thinking out loud there.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny sensitive types who are afraid to post because you don&#39;t want attacked<br/>\nwant to comment?

Does that mean that one has to<br/>\nbe a good debater to be a good unschooler? Aaack!! I hope not. I&#39;m not<br/>\nreally a good debater. I *do* have strong opinions about many things,<br/>\nunschooling being one of them, and I can defend my opinions *to a point*,<br/>\nbut when the discussion gets to the point when if feels like I&#39;m losing<br/>\nground and we&#39;re going in circles, I would rather give up than go on<br/>\ndebating. I don&#39;t really enjoy heated discussions. They make me feel<br/>\nuncomfortable. And I think this has to do with ones personality. BUT, I<br/>\nstill think I can unschool my kids, regardless of my debating skills. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just thinking out loud here.

It does not mean that I am going to stick them in a class and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make them do everything the instructor says and stick it out even<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it isn&#39;t what they though it would be.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; No I don&#39;t get upset if someone says &quot;so, what exactly do you mean<br/>\n&gt; by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lessons?&quot;  I do get upset when someone says, &quot;We don&#39;t believe in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lessons here.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This thread didn&#39;t start because of something *you* said.<br/>\n&gt; And no one ever said, &quot;we don&#39;t believe in lessons here&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; If anyone is jumping on things, it is you.<br/>\n&gt; Your example says, &quot;....my girls wanted to find lessons...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; That is not comparible to what the OP(and ensuing posts) was<br/>\n&gt; discussing.<br/>\n&gt; Your putting a slant on it that never existed.<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re trying to discuss unschooling here.
