Not for its crass commercialism and forced <br/>\nfrivolity, but because it&#39;s the season when the food police come out with <br/>\ntheir wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the holidays <br/>\nwithout gaining 10 pounds. You can&#39;t pick up a magazine without finding a <br/>\nlist of holiday eating do&#39;s and don&#39;ts. Eliminate second helpings, high-calorie <br/>\nsauces and cookies made with butter, they say. Fill up on vegetable sticks, <br/>\nthey say. Good grief. Is your favorite childhood memory of Christmas a carrot <br/>\nstick? I don&#39;t think so. Isn&#39;t mine, either. A <br/>\ncarrot was something you left for Rudolph. I have my own list of tips for <br/>\nholiday eating. I assure you, if you follow them, you&#39;ll be fat and happy. <br/>\nSo what if you don&#39;t make it to New Year&#39;s? Your pants won&#39;t fit anymore, <br/>\nanyway. <br/>\n<br/>\n1. About those carrot sticks. Avoid them. Anyone who puts carrots on a <br/>\nholiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit. In fact, if you see <br/>\ncarrots, leave immediately. Go next door, where they&#39;re serving rum balls. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Drink as much eggnog as you can. And quickly. Like fine single-malt <br/>\nscotch, it&#39;s rare. In fact, it&#39;s even rarer than single-malt scotch. You can&#39;t find <br/>\nit any other time of year but now. So drink up! Who cares that it has 10,000 <br/>\ncalories in every sip? It&#39;s not as if you&#39;re going to turn into an <br/>\neggnog-aholic or something. It&#39;s a treat. Enjoy it. Have one for me. Have two. It&#39;s later <br/>\nthan you think. It&#39;s Christmas! <br/>\n<br/>\n3. If something comes with gravy, use it. That&#39;s the whole point of gravy. <br/>\nPour it on. Make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes. Fill it with gravy. Eat <br/>\nthe volcano. Repeat. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they&#39;re made with skim milk or whole <br/>\nmilk. If it&#39;s skim, pass. Why bother? It&#39;s like buying a sports car with an <br/>\nautomatic transmission. <br/>\n<br/>\n5. Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control your <br/>\neating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat other people&#39;s <br/>\nfood for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college? <br/>\n<br/>\n6. Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New Year&#39;s. You <br/>\ncan do that in January when you have nothing else to do. This is the time for <br/>\nlong naps, which you&#39;ll need after circling the buffet table while carrying a <br/>\n10-pound plate of food and that vat of eggnog. <br/>\n<br/>\n7. If you come across something really good at a buffet table, like frosted <br/>\nChristmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa, position yourself near them <br/>\nand don&#39;t budge. Have as many as you can before becoming the center of <br/>\nattention. They&#39;re like a beautiful pair of shoes.You can&#39;t leave them behind. You&#39;re <br/>\nnot going to see them again. <br/>\n<br/>\n8. Same for pies. Apple. Pumpkin. Mincemeat. Have a slice of each. Or, if you <br/>\ndon&#39;t like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin. Always have three. <br/>\nWhen else do you get to have more than one dessert? Labor Day? <br/>\n<br/>\n9. Did someone mention fruit cake? Granted, it&#39;s loaded with the mandatory <br/>\ncelebratory calories, but avoid it at all cost. I mean, have some standards, <br/>\nmate. <br/>\n<br/>\n10. And one final tip: If you don&#39;t feel terrible when you leave the party or <br/>\nget up from the table, you haven&#39;t been paying attention. Reread tips. Start <br/>\nover. But hurry! Cookieless January is just around the corner.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
