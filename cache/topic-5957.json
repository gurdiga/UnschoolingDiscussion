Does anyone here combine the Oak Meadow stuff with<br/>\nan<br/>\n&gt; unschooling philosophy? Just curious I know they are very structured their<br/>\n&gt; curriculum and teacher directed but I wonder if there is a way to use the<br/>\n&gt; stuff they do without spending all the money just to get inspired. I want<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; learn how to play the recorder and also knit and think if I do it myself<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; kids may want to join me which is the Waldorf Kindergarten philosophy and<br/>\n&gt; Native American of being a role model but carry it over to other aspects<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; life using story telling and teaching writing through art in a child<br/>\n&gt; centered way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Beth<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Looking for the lowest refinance rate for your mortgage?<br/>\n&gt; GetSmart.com can help.
