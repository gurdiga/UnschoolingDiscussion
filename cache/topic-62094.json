She <br/>\nbasically has told me that she is only there because of sports and <br/>\nher friends.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, sorry for your daughter to be in such a horrible situation. I certainly wouldn&#39;t force her to stay home if she&#39;s really against it. Maybe though if you explain exactly how you would like things to work, she might consider doing it for awhile to see how she would like it. I would definitely have a plan to present to her before you do this though. Find out what kinds of sports you can get her into without her being in school. Rotary club and optomist sports programs and such. Find out where and when and what. Then make a plan for her to get together with kids her own age. Either plan something where she can invite her school friends or find out about organized teen dances, clubs whatever in your town. Look into homeschooling support groups and find out about teen functions and join now. <br/>\n<br/>\nPresent it all to her and then discuss the educational part of unschooling. Explain to her what it&#39;s all about. Child led, doing what interests her. If it means sports and bowling and friends, then you are fine with that. If she&#39;s concerned about the diploma part, then explain it can be as structured as she wants it also. If she would like it, tell her you will help her work towards getting her GED which she can do at 16. Would she like to get a job, maybe even part time now doing something? All possible things if she decides that&#39;s what she wants. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf none of this sounds appealing to her, I would let her decide on her own about school. Just what she wants out of it and how she wants to deal with school consequences. Meaning is she wants to skip, she&#39;ll have consequences for that. Extra work to make it up or skipping too often will mean suspension and maybe charges of being truant. Explain that you will be there for her, but that she can&#39;t call homeschooling if she skips too often and gets caught. It has to be a decision before any trouble occurs. Then I would back off and be there for her when she needs you to just listen or if she akss for help. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just suggestions on ways to go. My daughter Tara just turned 17 today and has always been in the system. When she was 15 she started to have a real rough time in school. Didn&#39;t want to be there aside from her friends. Was doing very poorly in her classes and suffereing mentally and physically as well. Of course we had some other problems to work on with her but school was a big one. I laid out a plan just like I described above. We discussed taking a year off from school and doing what she would like. Work, friends, job and such was all a part of the plan. We discussed her going back to school or working towards a GED. She had options and knew we were her for her every step of the way. I too am no longer with her dad and he&#39;s as stubborn and pigheaded and one sided as they come. (please no help on trying to find nice word for him!!!!) I stodd my ground and Tara saw I was serious and I would fight the world to get her what it would take to make her happy. She thought about long and hard. I also started to treat her more like a person instead of my 15 year old confused daughter. Does that make sense? That helped a lot too. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce she saw that she had some control, she had to seriously think about where she wanted to go. She opted to stay in school. Not the outcome I really wanted, but the one she did. She&#39;s doing wonderfully now. Happy and social and a delight all around. She has figured out the school system so she knows just how to work them all there. &lt;BEG&gt; Her grades are better than they have ever been. She has a great boyfriend, a wonderful job that she loves. They even promoted her after being there only 4 months. She saves money for her future and manages the rest to get what she wants. She&#39;s thinking of college and so far has her heart set on the University of Miami. Total turn around. All because it&#39;s what she really wanted and the decision was all hers to make. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts. I honestly believe for school kids, 12-15 is the roughest age. It gets better and telling your daughter that too will help. If you have any questions feel free to e-mail me off list. Can&#39;t plug up all these great unschooling thoughts with school!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":114499515,"authorName":"Lara Nabours","from":"&quot;Lara Nabours&quot; &lt;nabours@...&gt;","profile":"homenlovinit","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Teen issue","postDate":"1048703536","msgId":62148,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE1BQkJLTUNPRUZISUtJSlBBSUNLRUVEQ0VFQUEubmFib3Vyc0BhdHRiaS5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGI1c2NxaytvNGVwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62142,"nextInTopic":62178,"prevInTime":62147,"nextInTime":62149,"topicId":62094,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I rarely have time to post, but I couldn t resist as I have thought about this myself.

Eric <br/>\nis an only child, and they met at the gaming shop.<br/>\n<br/>\nEric was kind of jealous when Kirby got a job at the shop.  That was okay.<br/>\nHe used to tell Kirby &quot;You&#39;d like school.&quot;<br/>\nFrequently he would ask Kirby things like whether he could get into college.  <br/>\nThe regular stuf. <br/>\n<br/>\nEric&#39;s favorite school stuff is music and theatre and last year he went to <br/>\nafter-school Japanese classes every day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA year ago, Keith, Eric and Kirby were in the car and Eric said Kirby should <br/>\ntake at least one class at the high school so he would know how papers and <br/>\ntests were in case he went to college.  Keith said &quot;Why don&#39;t you both just go<br/>\n visit classes at UNM with Sadie or somebody?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt hadn&#39;t occurred to Erik that one could go to the university and look <br/>\naround.  Sadie was unschooled and she&#39;s doing fine, full time, at the <br/>\nuniversity.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Keith also said Kirby could take a class at the tech/vocational school <br/>\n(very near where we all live) anytime he wants to just try it out, and get <br/>\ncredit.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoor Eric! His pressured attempts to get Kirby into school were totally <br/>\nfoiled.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this year Eric&#39;s a junior.  His mom moved to another town and Eric didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to go so stayed with his step dad.  Moved in with his girlfriend&#39;s <br/>\nfamily.  Moved out (four days ago) into an apartment with her, but he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave a job.  They&#39;re seventeen, trying to live on their own, I think she has <br/>\na waitress job after school.<br/>\n<br/>\nEric also had gotten to the point were he was cutting his arms at school, <br/>\nwriting black, depressing, suicidal kind of goth trash all the time, being <br/>\ndramatic about how horrible life is, and so on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThrough all those years, Kirby and Marty (both of whom hang out with Eric, <br/>\ntogether and separately) have been calmly even-keeled, and very realistic in <br/>\ntheir assessments of Eric.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s sad, to see a kid get just entirely fed up and broken that way.  But two <br/>\nyears ago Eric was pretty sure he knew what Kirby and Marty really needed, <br/>\nand it was to be more like him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey play D&D every Saturday, and so the relationship will continue, and my <br/>\nboys have front-row seats to the play of Eric&#39;s life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t even have to begin to comment.

It was her job to type it up.  I called and excused <br/>\nher from school, but now I&#39;m not sure that was the right thing to <br/>\ndo.  I feel like I am giving her permission to procrastinate her <br/>\nschool work and responsibilities.  I hate the public school system, <br/>\nmy other children will not be going, but what do you do when one of <br/>\nyour kids is there and it is so obvious that it is not working for <br/>\nthem? I just want her to be happy.  She is a bright artistic young <br/>\nlady, but she is not allowed to be either in school.  All the <br/>\nprincipal has to say is that she is &quot;quite the manipulator&quot;.  Sorry <br/>\nto go on and on, but I am struggling with what to do.  Any ideas?<br/>\nJill</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62399,"nextTopicId":62412}}
