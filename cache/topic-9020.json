My dh&#39;s whole side of the family was getting together for a family<br/>\nportrait (13 of us in all). Not only were we having the large group, but all<br/>\nof us were each doing smaller groups (our own families, kids, one of just<br/>\nthe cousins, etc). We were going to purchase 2 of the biggest cameo<br/>\nportraits they have, over $125 ea. plus others. We probably were going to be<br/>\nspending over $500 in all. It took forever for them to take us in for the<br/>\npictures and the photgrapher was extremly rude. Two weeks later they called<br/>\nus and told us we had to go back and have them taken all over again! They<br/>\nhad cut off someone&#39;s head in the large group photo and the one of my family<br/>\nhad a light in it that wasn&#39;t supposed to be. So we all gort ready and<br/>\ntrugged back (with a special appointment). We walked into a mob scene. After<br/>\n~20-30 min. the photographer appeared and told us there was a 4 hour wait!<br/>\nNeedless to say we walked out and they lost $500. It still makes me mad to<br/>\nthis day!<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jaam1224@...\">Jaam1224@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 08, 2000 4:28 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] more venting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 6/7/00 11:19:09 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tn-k4of5@...\">tn-k4of5@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; Her demand for swim trunks on my babies gave me the urge to march over<br/>\n&gt; there and ask her to please refrain from screaming obscenities and abusing<br/>\n&gt; her children where mine could hear and see it.

So we went yesterday, when the little one took a nap in the car seat<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; Ali (3) was so tired she could hardly walk to get our $50 back.  When we<br/>\ngot<br/>\n&gt; there, the manager was taking a picture of a little boy probably 3 and was<br/>\n&gt; say rather nasty &quot;it is going to take longer if you keep moving.  see you<br/>\n&gt; already have moved from the way I put you.&quot;  and she was acting very<br/>\n&gt; frustrated and angry.

I ve had similar experiences with photographers and I know what you mean about the difficulty of getting ready and going out with small children.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-239208086\">Hi Julie. I&#39;ve had similar experiences with photographers and I know what<br/>\nyou mean about the difficulty of getting ready and going out with small<br/>\nchildren. I&#39;ve pretty much resigned to just taking photos myself and having<br/>\nthem enlarged, but I found an older lady who has obviously been a mother<br/>\nbefore  that I use when we do use a photographer. I think that makes a big<br/>\ndifference--if they&#39;ve been a mother themselves.<br/>\nAnd as for shyness, people have annoyingly commented about my daughter<br/>\nbeing shy too. I too am careful not to label her, and I would usually say,<br/>\n&quot;No she&#39;s not shy, she just has to get to know you,&quot; which is true. Kids<br/>\nwho are home with their mom and not dropped off with strangers regularly<br/>\nare naturally more cautious around strangers, which is a good thing. Though<br/>\npeople advised me that I needed to push her to &quot;be brave&quot; and give her more<br/>\nexperience in other&#39;s care, I didn&#39;t listen and just gave her all the time<br/>\nshe needed. Now she has become a trusting, outgoing, independent<br/>\nalmost-6-year-old.  ---Becky<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jaam1224@...\">Jaam1224@...</a><br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] more venting<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thursday, June 08, 2000 6:28 AM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 6/7/00 11:19:09 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tn-k4of5@...\">tn-k4of5@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; Her demand for swim trunks on my babies gave me the urge to march over<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; there and ask her to please refrain from screaming obscenities and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>abusing <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; her children where mine could hear and see it.
