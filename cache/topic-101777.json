They <br/>\neven  accepted this atheist! &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s a full weekend---intensive and exhausting.  <br/>\nBut it&#39;s very powerful. If you *want* help, it&#39;s a great place to go. One <br/>\nthing  Ben and I realized after hearing others&#39; situations was that *ours* wasn&#39;t <br/>\n nearly as bad! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nHere&#39;s a blurb from their website. On the website, you can click on your  <br/>\narea of the country to see when the next session near you will be  held.<br/>\n <br/>\nI highly recommend it.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\n   <br/>\nABOUT THE RETROUVAILLE PROGRAM<br/>\n<br/>\nRetrouvaille is a live-in weekend and post weekend program for  married <br/>\ncouples. The emphasis is on a technique of communication between a  husband and <br/>\nwife. During the weekend, a series of in-depth presentations are  given to you <br/>\nand other couples like yourselves. Each presentation, given by one  of three <br/>\nmarried couples and a priest, focuses on a specific area of a marriage  <br/>\nrelationship. After each presentation, you will have a chance to reflect on it  by <br/>\nyourself, then discuss it with your spouse in complete privacy. The weekend  is <br/>\nnot a spiritual retreat, not a sensitivity group, not a seminar, nor is it a  <br/>\nsocial gathering. You will, however be encouraged, to put the past behind you  <br/>\nand start &#39;rediscovering&#39; one another again. The weekend is not a &#39;miracle  <br/>\ncure&#39;, therefore, post-weekend sessions have been designed to continue the  <br/>\nmarriage renewal begun on the weekend. These follow-ups review earlier concepts  in <br/>\ngreater depth, present new ones and help you apply these concepts to your own <br/>\n marriage.  <br/>\nHOW CAN YOU GET MORE INFORMATION? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wish to remain anonymous when calling for more  information, you need <br/>\nnot identify yourself. <br/>\nIf you then wish to register on  a program, please be assured that all names <br/>\nare kept in strictest confidence.  <br/>\nFor U.S.A. contacts, please call 800-470-2230  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"marriage counselling and anniversaries","postDate":"1104149471","msgId":101777,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQuM2E2MDU1ZWMuMmYwMTU1ZGZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":101783,"prevInTime":101776,"nextInTime":101778,"topicId":101777,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/26/04 9:12:32 PM, kbcdlovejo@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-675565243\">In a message dated 12/26/04 9:12:32 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Between now & then, Ben & I will celebrate 19 years of marriage on  the <br/>\n28th. <br/>\nWhile waiting for _Finding Neverland_ to start this afternoon, he  leaned <br/>\nover and said this was our best year yet! &lt;G&gt; The Sweetie! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations!
