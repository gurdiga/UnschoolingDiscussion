I was told this is <br/>\n  discouraged because the county agent feels that it defeats the purpose of 4H <br/>\n  and meeting with other people.  She made it clear that this was her personal <br/>\n  philosophy. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra:  Why join 4H just to do a family project?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Me:  I&#39;m not really interested in doing just a family project.  When I asked about it, I was just gathering information and clarifying the information that others on this list gave me.  What irked me was that she wasn&#39;t giving me *all* of the information.  She only gave me what *she* was comfortable with because she (apparently?) doesn&#39;t agree with everything 4H promotes.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If the club isn&#39;t offering something we are interested in at the time, then it would be nice to be able to start our own project for that time period and add it to the club&#39;s repertoire.   If thats not part of the overall 4H philosophy, thats fine with me.  But if it *is* part of the overall philosophy, then she needs to tell me that, even if she doesn&#39;t agree with it.  If its a county decision, then she needs to also be clear about that so that we can look at other counties.  She did give me a neighboring county contact, but only because I specifically asked for it, not because she was trying to get us hooked up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra:  Individuals can enter things at county fairs and state fairs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Me:  Yes, but we aren&#39;t really interested in the fairs.  We want to meet other people.  I can&#39;t do that in our local 4H because &quot;enrollment is closed&quot; until next March and the community clubs here only run from June to August.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  In neighboring counties, the clubs run all year long and have open enrollment which is why we are enrolling there.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra:  Like a grange hall, part of the purpose <br/>\n  is knowing the neighbors.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Me:  Well my first preference would be to enroll in a club more local to us.   However, our &quot;neighbor&quot; clubs are &quot;closed&quot; until next March.  I think that is a problem when 4H is supposed to be for anyone interested at any time of year.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=I asked if families were required to attend meetings (we live in a rural <br/>\n  area).  She said &quot;yes&quot;.  And then she clarified and said that attendance at <br/>\n  meetings was &quot;expected&quot; (because of judging, etc).  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra:  If you didn&#39;t go to the meetings, why would you want to be in the club?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Me:  I *do* want to attend meetings.  But since we aren&#39;t really interested in competition, I don&#39;t want it to be held against us if for some reason we *can&#39;t* make all the meetings.   <br/>\n<br/>\n  There are projects that have some stringent rules, and they have those rules for good reasons.  I don&#39;t have a problem with that.  But there are plenty of other projects that are not competition based.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra:  Experiential learning doesn&#39;t need a club.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Me:  No, it doesn&#39;t.  But since our goal was to meet other people with similar interests, it would probably be fun and enriching to do it in a club.  And again, 4H has resources that aren&#39;t available to &quot;individuals&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-But it seems as though it is run in such a way as to make it out of reach <br/>\n  for a lot of kids (and other parent volunteers) who might otherwise be <br/>\n  interested in being involved.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra:  Having been involved for years in the SCA, I know that nobody needs a club to <br/>\n  learn about the Middle Ages.  If they want the club, they need to go where <br/>\n  the club meets, or create their own groups according to the guidelines the club <br/>\n  has, or find a different club.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Me:  The difference is that the SCA makes that clear in the materials.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What I have a problem with is that the national 4H organization and the state organization promote lots of options for families interested in 4H, but our county agent isn&#39;t &quot;comfortable&quot; with some of these options, and so doesn&#39;t even offer them unless pressed, and then strongly discourages them.  (Her exact words were, &quot;I&#39;m not comfortable with that&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t agree with that kind of interference.  I heard from the State office late this afternoon, and they agree with me and they will be discussing these issues with the county agent to see if they can bring her up to speed on the current philosophies of 4H.  In fact, the state coordinator mentioned right off the bat that the entire state is to have &quot;open enrollment&quot; and that my kids can enroll *any* time.  She also said there is a parent/child project called &quot;You Two&quot; that we can do as an intro to 4H for our first year.  Again, the county agent didn&#39;t even *mention* that even after all of my questions about us working on our own.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  In the meantime, we&#39;ve found another group in another county.  I&#39;ve corresponded with the leader and she is WONDERFUL!!!  She and I have so much in common.  She only lives 20 minutes from me.   Her club is kid run, and very flexible.  I think we&#39;ve found our match.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kristen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":131255249,"authorName":"Cornerstone Community Farm","from":"Cornerstone Community Farm &lt;joyfullife@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Fw: 4H concerns (to state office)","postDate":"1083874251","msgId":93604,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNTA2MTUxMC41MTM0Ny5qb3lmdWxsaWZlQG13dC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDJkLjNkMmVhYzI1LjJkY2JlNjQyQGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDJkLjNkMmVhYzI1LjJkY2JlNjQyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":93602,"nextInTopic":93609,"prevInTime":93603,"nextInTime":93605,"topicId":93583,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;d love anymore feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some concerns about the 4H program in our area.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few times we have tried to get involved with 4H, but its been nearly impossible, starting with sign ups.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I called to enroll, I was told there was an informational meeting held once a year and I would need to attend that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone who attends the meeting for the community club then gets to sign up for the projects they like.  It is first come first serve, and many of the projects are limited in space.  (The county agent lets the project leaders limit space if they feel they need to, and I do understand that).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis means that everyone RUSHES to the sign up table they are interested in, and if they don&#39;t get there in time, they can&#39;t do that project.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also means that kids with other committments on the night of the meeting are pretty much out of luck.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe gave up on the whole thing until just now.  I have been talking to others in other states who love 4H and it seems things are different for them, so I called our county extension office to see if I&#39;m missing something or if things are really that different.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some examples:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe national website says that a person can enroll any time of year.  But in our county, there is a specific time frame in which a child can enroll.  When enrollment is closed, the child must wait until the following year.  This enrollment period is in place for all the clubs in our county.  I asked why a child couldn&#39;t just &quot;catch up&quot; and I was told that wouldn&#39;t work because of show deadlines, &quot;and enrollment is closed for this year anyway&quot;. (It was closed May 1st).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was told that I could start my own club, and I wouldn&#39;t have to have a closed enrollment, but it sounded like she discourages that because of &quot;all the work it would be&quot; for me.  And she said that even if took enrollments after enrollment was &quot;closed&quot; in the rest of the county, the kids might not get on the county rolls until the FOLLOWING YEAR!  I assume that means they would not be able to do *any* shows, etc. for this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked about how our family might do our own project.  I was told this is discouraged because the county agent feels that it defeats the purpose of 4H and meeting with other people.  She made it clear that this was her personal philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked about joining an existing club and *then* doing our own project, if there weren&#39;t any offered by the club that we were currently interested in.  This is *also* discouraged and for the same reason though she said if the project were &quot;opened up&quot; to everyone else, and only my child &quot;signed up&quot; then it might be possible but would not be ideal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked if families were required to attend meetings (we live in a rural area).  She said &quot;yes&quot;.  And then she clarified and said that attendance at meetings was &quot;expected&quot; (because of judging, etc).  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut as I understand it there are many projects that don&#39;t involve &quot;shows&quot;, etc. but are simply about experiential learning.  Perhaps I&#39;m mistaken.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked if there were any homeschool groups (we homeschool).  But there are none in our county which is *very* surprising in this county as we have one of the largest homeschool populations in the state. <br/>\n<br/>\nI might add that nobody ever told me there were such a thing as &quot;project clubs&quot;.  I had no idea there was such a thing, or what the difference was between that and a community club.  The information wasn&#39;t even offered to me until I *asked* and then I only knew to ask after someone in another state described it to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is disappointing because I have talked to the extension office at least 4 or 5 different times and had I known about that, I might have started a club before I got involved with being a leader in another organization.<br/>\n<br/>\n4H has a great deal to offer, much more than I thought because the information I was given was so sketchy and enrollment is so difficult.  My kids have many interests they&#39;d like to pursue, but there seem to be constant obstacles in our way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe county agent sets up the 4H here to make it easier on the volunteers, and I do understand that.  I&#39;m a volunteer in another organization.  But it seems as though it is run in such a way as to make it out of reach for a lot of kids (and other parent volunteers) who might otherwise be interested in being involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you tell me if this is the norm across the state or is this limited to our county?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93468,"nextTopicId":93640}}
