I have been listening and contributing as I felt led to for<br/>\na while.  I still don&#39;t know why on email people feel such a need to<br/>\ndefend themselves.  It fuels the fire and fills up inboxes wastefully.  I<br/>\nthink we should just state our disagreement with the other&#39;s<br/>\ndisagreement, and leave it at that.  Someone has to take the first step<br/>\nof not reacting off the other&#39;s reaction.  If people had not disagreed<br/>\nwith other&#39;s definitions of unschooling, I would not have learned as much<br/>\nas I have about unschooling.  Our disagreements give us an opportunity to<br/>\ncommunicate, learn and challenge ourselves to grow.  People can argue<br/>\nwithout taking things personally.  My husband and I are very different. <br/>\nWhen we disagree, we state our differing feelings and opinions, then come<br/>\nup with a solution.  If there isn&#39;t any mutually agreeable solution<br/>\nbecause our opinions are so opposed, we agree to disagree.  No one has to<br/>\nwin.  No one has to lose.  But we both get to express our viewpoint and<br/>\nthat is what keeps us sane and together.  I think the world should have<br/>\nmore peace-no need to get mad just because someone is disagreeing with<br/>\nus.  Bonni</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34202,"nextTopicId":34207}}
