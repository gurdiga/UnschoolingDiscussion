I have created a private moderated list<br/>\nand I&#39;d like to invite any children who are interested to join.  The list is<br/>\nopen to all ages so please keep that in mind when you submit stories and<br/>\nkeep them clean.  The stories will come to me first and then as moderator, I<br/>\nwill send them on to the list.  This will help to keep it safe for our<br/>\nchildren.  If I feel something is unsuitable for the list, I may ask the<br/>\nauthor revise it and send it back again.  If you have children who are<br/>\ninterested in joining and sharing their stories and reading other children&#39;s<br/>\nstories, then please drop me a note and I&#39;ll send them an invitation to join<br/>\nthe list.
