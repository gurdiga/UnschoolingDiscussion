I can say that<br/>\nI have been homeschooling and especially unschooling way before I knew<br/>\nthe terms. I thought of it as parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live here in NYC. Our first field trip was to be to the top of the <br/>\nWTC. After<br/>\nthe 11th, my husband and I became even more resolved to have our kids enjoy<br/>\nlife without the pressures of conforming to a 9-5 lifestyle that we do not live<br/>\nas artists. So life has become our school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;A child who has manipulated how much allowance she has to figure out how<br/>\n&gt;much more she needs to buy something, and figured out the scores in games --<br/>\n&gt;and has heard her parents do these things so she&#39;s comfortable with the<br/>\n&gt;process -- can &quot;get&quot; what borrowing and carrying means (say before she takes<br/>\n&gt;the SATs ;-) because she&#39;s done that without realizing it. Whereas it can<br/>\n&gt;take hours and hours to teach it to a child whose major experience with<br/>\n&gt;numbers is problems in a book.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is absolutely right. At school I had to struggle to keep my grades up.<br/>\nIt was more a matter of pride that enjoyment. I WANTED that summa cum<br/>\nlaude. It did not mean I wanted to learn math. I just wanted that piece of<br/>\npaper that said I was on top.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love shopping for clothes and have always loved to since as far as I can<br/>\nremember. My parents did not talk about allowances. We had budgets<br/>\nand had to manage out money for whatever we needed. Needless to say,<br/>\nI became an excellent bargain shopper and that is a skill that involves<br/>\naccounting, appraising and logistics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;People tend to think of the addition and multiplication tables as synonymous<br/>\n&gt;with being able to do addition and multiplication.

For good baking to happen, measures have to be exact. <br/>\nAlthough US cookbooks<br/>\nuse spoons and cups, there are a few (live Levi-Beranbaum&#39;s Cake Bible and<br/>\nPie & Pastry Bible) that use weight measures. Cups and spoons are great for<br/>\nfractions and multiplications. The pans for cupcakes and cakes are <br/>\ngreat for showing<br/>\nratios and weights are a wonderful way of seeing the difference <br/>\nbetween &quot;analog&quot;<br/>\nand digital measures. Then, of course, there is the added bonus of having the<br/>\nopportunity to go over physics, chemistry, biology and physiology <br/>\n(especially if there<br/>\nare food allergies involved).<br/>\n<br/>\nMath can be as easy as the reward of a home-baked cupcake ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nLiza Sabater-Napier<br/>\nESPAÑOL PARA TODOS<br/>\nMamá de Evan y Aidan Napier<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Getting math (was Math experiences)","postDate":"1019396928","msgId":35449,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4RTgzQjgwLjc4RDMlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PEI4RTgyMkIwLjc4QzIlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":35434,"nextInTopic":35453,"prevInTime":35448,"nextInTime":35450,"topicId":35170,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Look at what they did when let<br/>\nloose of demanding curriculums!<br/>\nI believe that we learn detailed things better as ADULTS than any other<br/>\ntime in our lives. When we set our hearts to getting something done we<br/>\nget it done. Like you being the Chief Financial Officer of your<br/>\ncorporation. The math classes that you near failed at are nothing but a<br/>\ndistant memory. It didn&#39;t REALLY matter did it?<br/>\nI want my children to not be lazy. I believe that if I give them the<br/>\nroom to do things that they are interested in they will have<br/>\nself-motivation.<br/>\nToo much manipulated structure creates laziness.<br/>\nYou sound very motivated in your work. Maybe it was a blessing that the<br/>\nteachers didn&#39;t give you a hard time and found a heart to &quot;pass&quot; you, it<br/>\ntook the pressure off and kept you motivated, maybe?<br/>\nWe do use Saxon math around here. I pick and choose what to use<br/>\naccording to my children&#39;s bent.<br/>\nSometimes the book just sits there. There is no pressure to do the work<br/>\nanymore. I found that when I required a lesson a day my 14 yr. old was<br/>\nmiserable and didn&#39;t have the motivation to do anything else. The<br/>\nlessons literally ruined her day.<br/>\nI shoved the book across the table and told her, &quot;Do it when you feel<br/>\nyou can.&quot;<br/>\nShe loves working in her math book at night, She prefers to do only 15<br/>\nproblems a day. She went from getting 15 out of 30 wrong to 2 out of 15<br/>\nwrong and she&#39;s able to find her own mistakes. She has even begun to<br/>\nreference back in her book all by herself! I remember when she was<br/>\nworking on a problem and I asked her what her first thought was and she<br/>\ntook the book and began searching back a few chapters! I almost fell on<br/>\nthe floor! This is a child that would well up in tears at the sight of<br/>\nher math book. Her heart has totally changed!<br/>\nShe likes to do it now, but on HER terms. Not mine. And you know what?<br/>\nIf she slid it under the bed and didn&#39;t touch it again, that&#39;s okay with<br/>\nme. She&#39;ll be alright, I know she will. AND she isn&#39;t lazy. She knows<br/>\nwhere to find the information she needs. <br/>\nThanks for letting share! Sorry so long too! This is a great place to<br/>\nrelate.

In every other subject, I never even<br/>\n&gt; studied<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; until I was in graduate school, but math kicked my butt.<br/>\nSoooo......I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learned how to be friends with math teachers and that got me through<br/>\n&gt; &gt; school.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As an adult, I was taking flying lessons but couldn&#39;t pass the exam<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the math.
