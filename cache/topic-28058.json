I just meant that sometimes the initial<br/>\nmitigating factor is psychological and sometimes it is physical, but yes,<br/>\nthe two very definitely play together.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral years ago, I tore my anterior cruciate ligament in my knee and<br/>\nrequired surgery because it kept making me fall.  The doctor told me I would<br/>\nwalk out of the hospital.  When I woke up after the surgery, I panicked when<br/>\nI was unable to move my leg at all.  I was reassured by the nurse that this<br/>\nwas normal and it took 2 weeks to learn how to move my leg by using my thigh<br/>\nmuscles differently.  I felt myself to be in tremendous pain and thoroughly<br/>\nenjoyed all narcotics given to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 2 years after that, I tore the ligament again.  This time it required<br/>\nsurgery on both knees (on the left to repair the damage and on the right to<br/>\nscavenge spare parts).  I knew what to expect.  I was able to move both legs<br/>\nwithin hours of the surgery and took absolutely zero pain medication.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn both cases, the root cause was physical but the mental made all the<br/>\ndifference in my perception of the event how I handled it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28050,"nextTopicId":28066}}
