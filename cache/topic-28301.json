So, for<br/>\nexample, I&#39;m trying to work on something that&#39;s due that afternoon, I  am<br/>\nrepeatedly interupted, I yell. We chill for a bit, I come back and<br/>\napologize, I explain my frustration, and I say that next time,, I&#39;ll<br/>\narrange for here to be at a friend&#39;s house, or I&#39;ll make sure I let her<br/>\nknow when I&#39;m about to start this project so that we can take care of<br/>\nthings then, or whatever. I&#39;m not only apologizing, I&#39;m problem solving.<br/>\nIt&#39;s important that it not be a blaming thing - &quot;I&#39;m sorry I yelled but<br/>\nyou kept bugging me&quot; - but I think explanations help kids make sense out<br/>\nof their world. <br/>\n<br/>\nCacie has also yelled at me, then come bak after eating and apologized,<br/>\nand said she realizes now that she was really hungry and she&#39;s going to<br/>\ntry to eat breakfast next time even if she doesn&#39;t really feel hungry. <br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!

(I&#39;ve been on lists <br/>\nwhere it&#39;s been called &quot;educational neglect&quot;.)  And not vaccinating <br/>\ncould be called medical neglect.

To me there is a HUGE<br/>\n&gt; difference between &#39;cutting parents some slack&#39; and<br/>\n&gt; supporting abusive discipline patterns. Of course none<br/>\n&gt; of us our perfect. I however, I&#39;m pleased to say that<br/>\n&gt; my daughter has NEVER been hit with anything or by<br/>\n&gt; anyone, other than another child :-(. And speaking of<br/>\n&gt; that, why is it that we tell our kids that it&#39;s wrong<br/>\n&gt; to hit another person and yet there&#39;s a lot of people<br/>\n&gt; out there doing just that!? Who can possibly think<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s in the kid&#39;s best interest to be disrespected and<br/>\n&gt; belittled to such a degree!? I think it comes back to<br/>\n&gt; setting an example to your kids by your actions. I<br/>\n&gt; understand that sometimes people &#39;fly off the handle&#39;<br/>\n&gt; and may do something that they later regret, but I<br/>\n&gt; still think and feel that it&#39;s wrong. And I believe<br/>\n&gt; that everytime a child is hit, a little more of their<br/>\n&gt; self-esteem/respect is erroded.

When I <br/>\napologize to one of my children it is usually because I shouted at them <br/>\n(which, I think, is probably just as bad as spanking).  I always like to <br/>\nexplain why something happened.  Usually, it&#39;s something like &quot;I lost my <br/>\ntemper&quot; or &quot;I didn&#39;t get enough sleep last night&quot;.  I give them a big <br/>\nhug and I ask them to &quot;please forgive me, it was my fault&quot;.  They almost <br/>\nalways do within seconds and things go back to normal.  If I made them <br/>\nangry, I think they should be allowed to be angry.  After all, it was my <br/>\nmistake to shout at them.  I hurt them and they should be allowed to <br/>\nexpress their feelings.  I have found they never stay angry with me for <br/>\nmore than a half hour.
