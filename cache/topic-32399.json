At the<br/>\ncommunity college, if you want to enter a specific program, they test and<br/>\nplace you according to what you need to take for the career you are<br/>\nseeking.  There is also the g.e.d. course there, which my son wants to<br/>\ntake when he is sixteen, so he can say he got it, not because it is<br/>\nrequired.  We have to take a test every two or three years so the school<br/>\ndistrict will allow us to keep homeschooling.  I can&#39;t help but ask, why<br/>\ndon&#39;t you do that for kids in p.s.?  My husband asked me about tests, and<br/>\nI quoted John Holt from &quot;How Children Learn&quot;, page 293.  &quot;We do not need<br/>\nto keep picking away at their minds to make sure they are learning.  What<br/>\nwe need to do, and all we need to do, is bring as much of the world as we<br/>\ncan into the school and the classroom; give children as much help and<br/>\nguidance as they need and ask for; listen respectfully when they feel<br/>\nlike talking; and then get out of the way.  We can trust them to do the<br/>\nrest.&quot;<br/>\nBonni<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32398,"nextTopicId":32401}}
