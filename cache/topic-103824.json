Now, they have chosen not to read anything at this point but that<br/>\nis their choice.  At least I have offered information. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I manipulated a situation for one half a second. I reached over with my &quot;manus&quot; (hand) and paused a movie, because Holly had come into the room.  It was the bloodily horrible, little Jody Foster screaming &quot;NO&quot; scene near the end of Taxi Driver, which I had never seen and decided to take off into Kirby&#39;s room and watch by myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s lately interested in Robert DeNiro, so I had earlier shown her a pleasant, happy scene with him and Jody Foster, mentioned that they&#39;re considered two of the best American actors, and there they were young and together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t want Holly to have that bloody picture in her head, especially out of context.  She asked me something, and I said I was sorry she had even seen THAT much, and turned to her in such a way that she wasn&#39;t looking at the screen anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t being sneaky about watching that movie, and I didn&#39;t know how loud and bloody it would get.  Holly really trusts me about movies and other things, though, because of years and years of my being honest with her, and compassionate when she insisted anyway, and willing to let her sleep with me if she was scared, and willing to help her talk through her concerns and fears and expressions of regret.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat can all apply to karate lessons and playdates too, I think.  Trust is trust, separate from other things.  It&#39;s one measure of the relationship between two people, and maybe it&#39;s the main part.  So parents who have been manipulative or dishonest can change direction just a little, and avoid that in the future.  But first they have to see it, and so I think this conversation is probably useful to a few lurkers and will be helpful to some in the future who wander in there and find it in the archives, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] manipulation and hot dogs, was Re: Manipulation.....","postDate":"1109005720","msgId":103846,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDMkU5MjRBLjZENDIyRjZDLjBDOEQ0NUE4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103839,"nextInTopic":103848,"prevInTime":103845,"nextInTime":103847,"topicId":103824,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-This is what I was beginning to think about some (not all) of the situations described: that sometimes some of the kids might feel like they just want to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1766035942\">-=-This is what I was beginning to think about some (not all) of the<br/>\nsituations described: that sometimes some of the kids might feel like<br/>\nthey just want to have some control over what&#39;s going on...-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night there was a PBS show on gorilla habitats at zoos.  I didn&#39;t see all of it, just about half and that choppy. But one thing that was very cool was a discussion of giving them as many choices as possible.  They&#39;re unwilling to mate when they don&#39;t have choices in their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnimal behavioralists have said for a long time that perceptions of safety and of plenty help animals in the wild to decide to mate or to raise litters/offspring optimally.  So it makes sense that with primates, one of their &quot;safety&quot; issues will be the feeling of power and choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiving them choices is another way we can empower our kids, respect them, and make them real. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] manipulation and hot dogs, was Re: Manipulation.....","postDate":"1108999550","msgId":103839,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRGNTlDMkMxLjQzRTRCQzE3LjBCOTdBM0ZCQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103837,"nextInTopic":103846,"prevInTime":103838,"nextInTime":103840,"topicId":103824,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
