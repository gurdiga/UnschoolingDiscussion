I have a question that has been concerning me about my kids. I have <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;9 1/2yr. old son and a 7yr. old son. My 9 yr old will ask me every question<br/>\n&gt;under the sun about everything in life. Together we find and search out the<br/>\n&gt;answers to all his questions (and sometimes he reads and searches for <br/>\n&gt;answers<br/>\n&gt;by himself). But, my 7 yr. old never asks us any questions about anything. <br/>\n&gt;He<br/>\n&gt;loves dinosaurs and big trucks. He does a lot of dinosaur digging in the <br/>\n&gt;back<br/>\n&gt;yard and he plays with his trucks most of the day. He looks at picture <br/>\n&gt;books<br/>\n&gt;but doesn&#39;t yet read. I haven&#39;t pushed him in anyway to learn anything. <br/>\n&gt;But,<br/>\n&gt;yet he asks us no questions about anything. Is this strange or normal or<br/>\n&gt;what? Is it because he learns in a different way? Should I be concerned or<br/>\n&gt;just let things be? Any suggestions? I would appreciate some advice about<br/>\n&gt;this.<br/>\n&gt;Lisa H.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8175,"nextTopicId":8168}}
