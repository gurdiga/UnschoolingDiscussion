They bought a piece of pvc pipe<br/>\n(18&quot;) and found the middle.  Dad drilled a hole through it and they put a<br/>\ndole through that which they set on some books.  They drilled two pie tins<br/>\n(old fashioned metal ones that they found at Goodwill) and they had the<br/>\nbutcher weight them and the bolts they fixed them on with (o.k., so middle<br/>\nchild is perfectionist &lt;g&gt;) until they found a match for as close to exact<br/>\nweight as they could find.  They then used pennies for their counter<br/>\nbalance.  I don&#39;t remember what the number is (but I&#39;ll bet someone on the<br/>\nlist does) but I think it is about 3 or 4 pennies is an ounce.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe also made a hanging one using the same method.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Tim and Kerry Jones &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pakt@...\">pakt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Measuring<br/>\n&gt; Date: Saturday, March 04, 2000 6:56 AM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Tim and Kerry Jones &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pakt@...\">pakt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi all!  Anyone out there with any ideas or instructions for making your<br/>\n&gt; own balancing scale?  We&#39;re about to delve into the Guinness Book of<br/>\n&gt; World Records for awhile and it has set off an interest in measuring<br/>\n&gt; around here.  We thought it would be fun to compare weights and volumes<br/>\n&gt; until we checked into how much a brand new balance and weights costs! <br/>\n&gt; WHEW!!  So any and all ideas would be appreciated. Thanks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kerry<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
