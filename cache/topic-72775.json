I think we use the word lightly and<br/>\nhumorously when a task with small number of steps becomes a project<br/>\nbecause of many obstacles - sometimes because of interruptions.<br/>\nSometimes for me loading the dishwasher becomes a &quot;project&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn primary (US-grade) school a &quot;Project&quot; was regurgitating encyclopedia<br/>\ninformation about the wildlife in Antarctica with illustrations, a<br/>\npretty title page and formatted like a picture book. Drawing (or<br/>\ntracing) got more points than pasting. Neatness counted. It makes me<br/>\nthink of the craft of scrapbooking without the personality. Sometimes it<br/>\nwas making diorama. Presentation was all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly in high school, Projects became Assignments, and the many<br/>\nillustrations needed to be fewer b&w line drawings and the words typed,<br/>\nand a &quot;Project&quot; was some kind of group produced thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nCome to think of it, I think we were just recreating the visual style of<br/>\nthe &quot;grade appropriate&quot; textbooks we were using.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":70316959,"authorName":"AimeeL73@cs.com","from":"AimeeL73@...","profile":"aimeels73","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Project (was Changes/struggles)","postDate":"1055017016","msgId":72775,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGExLjM5YjQxNTQ1LjJjMTNhMjM4QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":72779,"prevInTime":72774,"nextInTime":72776,"topicId":72775,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"ecsamhill@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1434295887\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ecsamhill@...\">ecsamhill@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; **Don&#39;t have a lot of expectations about <br/>\n results, just have fun.**<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Maybe THAT&#39;S the downside of the word &quot;project&quot;.

But really, the point is to hem the <br/>\nsheers.  I could do it crooked, or sewn badly, but I have my own standards.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re not rigid standards, I just want it to look right after all this <br/>\nplanning and work, that&#39;s all.  <br/>\n<br/>\n    Alex is making a wooden box.  He&#39;s not sanding down the edges of the <br/>\npieces yet, and he&#39;ll probably figure out soon that if he wants the end flush to <br/>\nthe other piece, he&#39;s gonna hafta sand that puppy down a bit. Because his <br/>\nproject is a box, and he&#39;ll want it to look like a box when he&#39;s done.  <br/>\n<br/>\n    I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with working toward a desired <br/>\noutcome.  People do it in real life.  They set goals, and work towards them.
