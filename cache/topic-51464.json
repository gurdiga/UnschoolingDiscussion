If <br/>\nthe family felt that it was an inconvenience, wouldn&#39;t the family choose to clean<br/>\nit up? <br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe a different option would be to ask how you would ask your husband...<br/>\n&quot;hey guys, we can&#39;t walk in here, can you help me clean it up?&quot; and work with <br/>\nthem to get it straightened up. I know that if my husband came in and said,<br/>\nthis place is a mess, no computer time until you get it cleaned up&quot;, I would<br/>\nhave a few choice words for him (and it wouldn&#39;t be &quot;sure honey!&quot;, more along the<br/>\nlines of, if you think that it is messy, feel free to clean it yourself!). I also<br/>\nwill admit to having asked Jason if he could help me pick up the floor before<br/>\nwe play a board game. But that is because there is no place for the board game if<br/>\nwe don&#39;t and I have also explained to him that mommy can&#39;t concentrate and enjoy<br/>\nthe game if surrounded by a complete mess. If he does not help me, then I just pick<br/>\nthings up myself, but for the most part he does help because it goes faster and it<br/>\nis more fun  because we are doing it together.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are happy with doing things the way you are doing them. Great. Please don&#39;t<br/>\ntake my advice as saying that you *must* do things this way. But rather that there<br/>\nare other options that don&#39;t involve threats or punishments. This has been<br/>\none of the best things that I have learned after being on this list for several <br/>\nmonths now, there are always other options.  I am able to look at my interactions<br/>\nwith my kids and see things from their perspective easier. This has been hard at <br/>\ntimes because I have seen some areas where I have not been as respectful to them<br/>\nas I had always thought that I was. Because my parents talked to me that way and <br/>\nmost of my friends talk to their kids that way. And it is accepted and even promoted<br/>\nin parenting books and mags. Some may think that it is extreme, that it is no big deal to<br/>\nsay that the room must be cleaned before the tv is watched. And it probably works in <br/>\nthe short run. But I keep coming back to how I would feel if someone held that kind <br/>\nof power over me.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may not agree with me. That is fine. But there are more respectful ways to deal<br/>\nwith the situation you talk about above. And that is what the ladies here are <br/>\nwonderful at pointing out. Because it may not be obvious at first. You may not<br/>\neven see it as a problem. If it is not, then don&#39;t take the advice. If it is, <br/>\nthen you have another option to try.
