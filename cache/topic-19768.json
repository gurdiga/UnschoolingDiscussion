I have been subscribed to this group for<br/>\n&gt; awhile, but nervous about posting.  I am 35; have 3 kids (6,3 & 1).<br/>\n&gt; My oldest is now at the age that I have to decide on a charter<br/>\n&gt; school.  For my husband&#39;s comfort level, I am going to try one out<br/>\n&gt; for this first year. Are there any Californians out there that can<br/>\n&gt; refer me to one?  I really do not want one that imposes a curriculum<br/>\n&gt; on us. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19765,"nextTopicId":19772}}
