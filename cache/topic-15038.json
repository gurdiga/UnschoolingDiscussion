I usually lurk here but I wanted to reply <br/>\nto this and to thank you for taking the time to boost my confidence. I live <br/>\nin PA so we are legally bound to certain laws such as a portfolio and book <br/>\nlists and objectives. These things have a tendency to upend your confidence <br/>\nwhen you arent &quot;doing&quot; school. The way this year has gone for us, &quot;doing&quot; <br/>\nschool has been scarce indeed. I wince when I think of the other day and how <br/>\nangry I was at my 10 yr old for forgetting how to borrow in subtraction. You <br/>\nsee, THAT would look bad for me if anyone knew. &lt;sigh&gt; I must constantly keep <br/>\nin mind that I am not doing this for the school system. Basically what I am <br/>\nsaying is that it is soooooooo encouraging to know that they will grow into <br/>\nthe peop[e they are meant to be if I will allow it without pushing them.... <br/>\nAnd your letter helped remind me.<br/>\nty :o)<br/>\n~~~Carrie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15036,"nextTopicId":15043}}
