I don&#39;t<br/>\neven want to do that!  I know my son is learning so much, but since we live on a<br/>\nfarm most of it is not book learning.  And besides who cares?  As long as he<br/>\nknows what he needs to know in order to fulfill his dreams that&#39;s fine with me,<br/>\n:)<br/>\nI&#39;m planning on buying the tests, and then just doing them together.  I think he<br/>\nwill understand that we have to have them in our file just so we can continue to<br/>\nstay home.  He is a very philosophical child at 6!<br/>\nAn<br/>\n<br/>\nclaudia partick wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;claudia partick&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pinintree@...\">pinintree@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just finished reading all the intros and now here is mine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My name is Claudia I live in Kansas with my husband and 4yr old daughter,<br/>\n&gt; We decided to homeschool Victoria when she was still very young.  I love<br/>\n&gt; to do research and so after we decided I set about reading as much as I<br/>\n&gt; could about homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; and that is how we ended up becoming unschoolers.  I am now reading John<br/>\n&gt; Holts books and they<br/>\n&gt; just reinforce everything I knew in my heart and logical mind.  I still have<br/>\n&gt; the problem with testing or not<br/>\n&gt; testing, I really like feedback and I still have the public school instilled<br/>\n&gt; need for knowing if she is learning<br/>\n&gt; I fight my urge to test her even informally.  And everyonce and awhile she<br/>\n&gt; will surprise me by knowing something I was sure she didn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; I am so glad there is this list and site I don&#39;t know any unschooler in my<br/>\n&gt; area everyone seems or school at home.  and I just love getting email!!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Deadline is June 19.
