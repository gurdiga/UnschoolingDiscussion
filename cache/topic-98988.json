Should I be more interested in converting <br/>\nothers?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n-----<br/>\nNo, I don&#39;t think people should worry if they sense another isn&#39;t really <br/>\ninterested, or wouldn&#39;t begin to understand.    Just say &quot;We homeschool a <br/>\ndifferent way&quot; or whatever will get them past that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think others should be converted.  It&#39;s hard enough to communicate the <br/>\nsubtleties of successful unschooling to those who really WANT to get it.   It&#39;s <br/>\nimpossible to convey that to the clueless or resistant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s harder to get to, those who get there will be more appreciative and <br/>\nattentive than if it&#39;s scattered out all over the place and nobody has to work to <br/>\nfind it.  If we somehow could make it an easy option for everyone the first day <br/>\nthey discovered homeschooling,what would probably happen (I fear) is that <br/>\nthere would be MUCH noise made about it being &quot;doing nothing.&quot;  And <br/>\npeople would rejoice that they &quot;didn&#39;t have to do anything.&quot;  And so how long <br/>\nwould it be before they even wondered what they DID need to do to make it <br/>\nwork?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people just don&#39;t like to play missionary or teacher, either, and so I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink they should feel the least big guilty if a &quot;teaching moment&quot; goes by and <br/>\nthey haven&#39;t told other people what unschooling is. Let it go.  Let those who do <br/>\nhave the urge to nudge others to the point of discomfort do it. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way to deal with it is to just answer direct question simply.<br/>\n&quot;Do you use a curriculum?&quot;  &quot;No.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;How do you know they&#39;re learning?&quot;  &quot;Various ways.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":44699497,"authorName":"James and Lari Johnston","from":"&quot;James and Lari Johnston&quot; &lt;mop@...&gt;","profile":"larijjo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Those pesky competitive feelings","postDate":"1094131359","msgId":98988,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmMwMWM0OTBlZiRlZjE4MDlkMCQwODhlYjBkOEB0b3NoaWJhdXNlcj4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":99021,"prevInTime":98987,"nextInTime":98989,"topicId":98988,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One of the moms there just figured out that I really mean it when I say we don t do lessons.

And she asked me the dreaded <br/>\nquestion &quot;So -- what do you DO all day long?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n============<br/>\nTo those people I&#39;m sensing disbelief from and not a true desire to really learn about unschooling and how it does work; to those not interested in investing some time to discover the truths of unschooling I simply say &quot;we as a family can&#39;t learn in a school environment&quot;. That &quot;we learn better through life lessons&quot;. That &quot;we have to be creative in with our learning styles&quot;. That usually does it if they&#39;re not really wanting to investigate the options for themselves, if they&#39;re just looking to see just how crazy we really are :).<br/>\nI would love to preach the virtues of unschooling to those who are and even those who aren&#39;t asking... all the time...everywhere, because I&#39;m so convinced, but I don&#39;t. Am I a betrayer of unschooling? Should I be more interested in converting others? At this point I can sense the difference between  who really wants to know because  what they&#39;re doing now isn&#39;t working for them or they are open minded interested people who may not even have kids at school age compared to those that the only impression I&#39;ll leave with them is what  *neglectful* parents we are.  <br/>\nI choose who to intimately share our unschooling lives details with. I may even phrase, ever so politely,  a description so it will sound somewhat acceptable (if not a little mysterious) just to get people to shut up and leave us alone. I&#39;m not always up for the argument-is that so wrong?<br/>\nLari<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98993,"nextTopicId":99004}}
