I especially like what <br/>\nSandra Dodd posted below.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t going to post on this topic until a conversation I had with <br/>\nmy chiropractor&#39;s secretary inspired me to share...<br/>\n<br/>\n(Preface: my 17month old head-butted me in the nose yesterday <br/>\nafternoon and after hearing a crunch and looking in the mirror to <br/>\nfind my nose having shifted a good few centimeters to the right, we <br/>\nrushed off to the chiropractor&#39;s convinced my nose was broken!!  <br/>\nFortunately it was not and this saved me a trip to the hospital.  Woo-<br/>\nhoo!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, after having my nose inspected, the secretary commented on my <br/>\n3 year old saying that he was such a beautiful child and was just <br/>\nshining with a glow on his face.  She asked me, &quot;He doesn&#39;t watch any <br/>\ntelevision does he?&quot;  This made be laugh inside because what I really <br/>\nwanted to say was something like, well, you have no idea how much tv <br/>\nhe watches!  Quite an addict my partner would say!  I came close to <br/>\nsaying, actually I let him watch as much tv as he wants!  And, boy, <br/>\nis it alot!  When in fact what I did say was that no, he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwatch television because we don&#39;t get cable, and thus no channels, <br/>\nbut he does like to watch quite a few vidoes!  More than my partner <br/>\nprefers, but I am much more flexible about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was an interesting conversation, and she was suprised that <br/>\nSebastian watched any tv at all, because she said it seemed like <br/>\nchildren who watch a lot of tv don&#39;t have a glow like my child does.<br/>\nPerhaps his glow comes from the fact that we let him watch whatever <br/>\nhe wants whenever he wants, and respect his desires and interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nSebastian started watching tv (back when we had cable- gotta love The <br/>\nCroc Hunter and Nick Jr.!) towards the end of my pregnancy with his <br/>\nbrother (they&#39;re 22 1/2 months apart).  Then, we let the cable go <br/>\n(due to finances) and soon he was a video junkie.  His video watching <br/>\nescalated to a good 5 videos a day easily, and at times I did <br/>\nfeel &#39;concerned&#39;, but this was something I had to process myself.  He <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t play, or do something else while watching a video.  He <br/>\nliterally did just sit on the couch and watch.  He was concentrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not concerned anymore, and he still loves to watch.
