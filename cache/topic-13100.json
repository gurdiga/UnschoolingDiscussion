Since they&#39;re all non-partisan and I couldn&#39;t tell<br/>\nby their written profiles how they felt about homeschooling, I emailed all<br/>\nof them to ask. (this was a great lesson for my kids)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first to respond was David Blomstrom. I give him points for promptness<br/>\nand honesty...as he said he never really thought about homeschooling, but<br/>\ncould understand why people would leave the p/s system. He wanted to &quot;fix&quot;<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen came Neil T. B. Helgeland, who rambled almost as bad as in his on-line<br/>\nprofile. He then asked me for money.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile on-line  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dnet.org/wa/\">http://www.dnet.org/wa/</a>  (thanks to Blomstrom) I read that<br/>\nArthur Hu is in favor of homeschooling and any other alternative to<br/>\ntraditional p/s also, but gives no details. (IOW, regulated homeschooling or<br/>\nhands-off homeschooling?) He has yet to respond to my email so I can&#39;t say.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can imagine, Terry Bergeson didn&#39;t say anything meaningful in her<br/>\nprofile and has not emailed, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe winner for me is Don Crawford. His response to my question &quot;What is your<br/>\nposition on homeschooling?&quot; is below.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Valerie (sorry for any duplicates...I&#39;m sending this to all my<br/>\nhomeschooling lists)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am in favor of home schooling.  It should be totally deregulated (as<br/>\nshould the public schools-back to local control).  I also would support a<br/>\ntax credit for anyone whose child is not schooled at taxpayer expense, which<br/>\nwould include homeschoolers as well as private schoolers (like our family).<br/>\nI&#39;m a Libertarian so I&#39;m firmly committed to such ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nDon Crawford<br/>\n6063 Orchard Court, Ferndale, WA 98248<br/>\n(360) 380-4158  Fax (360) 312-8729<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.att.net/~donald.crawford/index.html\">http://home.att.net/~donald.crawford/index.html</a><br/>\nfor Supt. of Public Instruction<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://go.to/crawford2000\">http://go.to/crawford2000</a><br/>\nThe essence of individualism derives not from accumulating idiosyncratic<br/>\naffectations, but rather from stripping those affectations away.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13098,"nextTopicId":13102}}
