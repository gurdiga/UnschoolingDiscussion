I&#39;ve seen them in Wal-mart, Shopper&#39;s Drug Mart, Canadian Tire, even Grand & Toy (stationary store.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve never tried sleeping pills, as I usually have enough trouble getting up in the morning even after a full nights sleep with nothing in my system, LOL.  I have used herbal stuff, though.  Valerian is quite powerful, knocks me right out.  Chamomile tea works pretty well too, I usually drink a &quot;tummy mint&quot; kind, cause my belly will wake me up at night as often as my head.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve often been kept awake by the &quot;spinning thoughts&quot; stuff, can&#39;t make my brain stop.  For that, I&#39;ve found the only thing I can really do is to get up, turn on the light, and start writing out what I&#39;m thinking, and try to bring my thoughts to a logical end point.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Allison<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; A sound machine?<br/>\n  &gt; I know what you mean but I have never seen one.<br/>\n  &gt; Where would you find such a thing?<br/>\n  &gt; A pharmacy?<br/>\n  &gt; I live in Canada so the stores may carry different items.<br/>\n  &gt; interesting idea....<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I may need to use drugs in hte short term as things are really coming to a<br/>\n  &gt; head and I need to keep myself in good mental shape to handle the events.<br/>\n  &gt; Has anyone used any sleeping pills and have any advice about which ones<br/>\n  &gt; would help me sleep through the night??
