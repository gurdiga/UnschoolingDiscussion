The first time I saw it my<br/>\ndaughter was just a baby -ish sort (I can&#39;t remember<br/>\nhow old but it seems soooo small and young compared to<br/>\n3)  :( and my son...must have been like 3 1/2 or 4 or<br/>\nsomething...<br/>\nand we were travelling (my son&#39;s favorite thing to do,<br/>\nhe was so &quot;easy&quot; to travel with, too) with my oldest<br/>\nsister who had left doing Electrical contracting<br/>\n-owned her own business (cuz of all the stupid<br/>\npolitics involved with doing ANYTHING of any authority<br/>\nas a woman),- to do &quot;wax hands&quot; (make wax molds of<br/>\npeople&#39;s hands) at fairs and festivals across the<br/>\ncountry on her own and thus make money expressing<br/>\nherself creatively and doing something she really<br/>\nloved- travelling. Well, I had gone with her while<br/>\npregnant with dd, travelling up the east coast -ending<br/>\nup in NY before coming home- and seeing alot of things<br/>\nwe (ds and me) may not have seen otherwise. Alot of<br/>\nour time was spent in a small RV (our &quot;temporary<br/>\nhome&quot;) and we loved it. It was not a popular move to<br/>\nsome people, travelling all summer while pregnant and<br/>\n&quot;dragging&quot; your 2 yr old along with you, with nothing<br/>\nbut two other women and your 13 yr old niece, not a<br/>\nman in sight! (*gasp*), but my son still remembers it.<br/>\n<br/>\noh my I&#39;ve gotten off on a tangent again. anyway,<br/>\nafter dd was born we travelled just somewhat locally<br/>\nwith my sister, cuz it was a relaxed creative way to<br/>\nmake money and expose my kids to alot of interesting<br/>\npeople and places, and on our way home dd got a little<br/>\nbit of a cold, along with me, and we decided to spend<br/>\nthe day in our hotel room (RV was not around for this<br/>\ntrip) and order in for food and swim and watch TV. ds<br/>\n(and me I must admit) loves NickJr so we turned there<br/>\nof course, expecting to find Blue&#39;s Clues and lo and<br/>\nbehold there is this new show that they are having a<br/>\nMARATHON of, allll day long. and it is about AN<br/>\nUNORTHADOX TRAVELLING FAMILY WITH *****SMART**** KIDS<br/>\nTHAT DON&#39;T GO TO SCHOOL!!!!! I was in heaven , and<br/>\nTHEN I heard Nigel&#39;s voice. Being a HUGE, and let me<br/>\nemphasize *HUGE* Tim Curry fan, it really couldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave gotten any better for me. Ds said &quot;Mom look! they<br/>\nhave a driving house just like we did! Cool!&quot; <br/>\n And surprisingly, my kids have actually learned alot<br/>\nabout some very interesting animals that I didn&#39;t even<br/>\nknow existed cuz they saw them on Thornberrys and then<br/>\nthought they were so cool that we had to read more<br/>\nabout them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI love that show. I think it actually is my very<br/>\nfavorite current cartoon. Dd&#39;s is Dora the Explorer.<br/>\nDora&#39;s her hero. :)<br/>\nhm. well, thanks for taking the time to read this<br/>\nextremely looong rambling if you&#39;re still reading. :)<br/>\n-Bobbie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Never heard of this show -- could someone tell me<br/>\n&gt; what channel it&#39;s on, how<br/>\n&gt; long it&#39;s been running, and about what age group you<br/>\n&gt; think would enjoy it?<br/>\n&gt; Also, my pet peeve regarding most television shows,<br/>\n&gt; are the people on the<br/>\n&gt; show nice and respectful to each other?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks, Ashley Harvie, mom to Willis, 5, and<br/>\n&gt; Frances, 2<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!

It&#39;s on Nickelodeon. When I first saw it, I thought, &quot;Eew. Did<br/>\nthey have to draw the characters like that?&quot; but it grew on me. Mostly<br/>\nbecause the main character, Eliza, reminds me of my own pre-adolescent<br/>\ndaughters. And the fact that they unschool. The idea is, the family creates<br/>\na nature show for TV. They travel all over the world. To make it really<br/>\ninteresting, Eliza magically has the ability to talk with animals. So we get<br/>\nto learn about animals and other cultures, etc. And it&#39;s just funny. The<br/>\nsisters fight and complain, but they all definitely love each other. There&#39;s<br/>\nalso Darwin the chimp and Donny the wild boy they adopted. I don&#39;t know if<br/>\nyour kids are old enough to really enjoy it, though.
