I joined this unschooling list because I want to read/discuss unschooling -- not politics. Don&#39;t get me wrong, politics and discussions of public policy have a prominent place in my life. I&#39;ve spent most of my adult career in politics, public policy and advocacy as a paid professional and as a volunteer.  I enjoy a lively debate of opposing views, but I don&#39;t enjoy having it imposed on every aspect of my life.  It reaches a saturation point after a while, ya&#39;know?      <br/>\n<br/>\nNed, this list is not the place.  Please take your politically-oriented posts over to NHEN Speak-out or some other list where politics is an appropriate topic. Or perhaps create your own yahoo group list. Please help keep this list on the unschooling topic for which it was created.<br/>\n           <br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nAlicia <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody&#39;s treated me that way for a long time except you, Ned.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t answer people&#39;s questions when they ask them.  You&#39;re not really <br/>\ndiscussing anything with us, just telling us over and over and over and over <br/>\nand over the same screeching thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling laws and policies are summarized in very many places on the <br/>\nweb, at www.unschooling.com, at the NHEN site, probably at HEM&#39;s site, A-to-Z <br/>\nHome&#39;s Cool, before even getting into the conservative sites.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we use an international list to discuss immediate needs of unschoolers, it <br/>\nwill be a great use of an international list.  Discussing American <br/>\nLibertarian &quot;philosophy&quot; is not a good use of an international unschooling <br/>\nlist.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40716,"nextTopicId":39455}}
