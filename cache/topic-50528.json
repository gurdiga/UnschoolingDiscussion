This sounds <br/>\nstrange, but it&#39;s the advice I got here and it&#39;s working beautifully.  <br/>\nRecently, we moved a tv out of Trevors room and into the living room. I made <br/>\na deal in which the N64 became family property instead of his (now I have to <br/>\nfigure out how to afford that Gamecube which was part of the deal) and <br/>\neveryone has access to it more easily now.<br/>\nJared was spending hours on it, and Sierra was getting mad. I would gently <br/>\nremind him that if he wasn&#39;t sensitive to the fact that she wanted time, then <br/>\nshe might have a hard time being sensitive also.<br/>\nI&#39;ve asked them to focus on a way to solve the problem if two want it at the <br/>\nsame time, instead of focusing on how long the other person had it or any <br/>\nother challenge at the moment.  It&#39;s interesting to see how they deal with it.<br/>\nSometimes I have to mediate, but most often, without undue pressure, the <br/>\nperson playing will hand it over to the other person eventually and everyone <br/>\nis fine.<br/>\nThe longer you let them use it where, when and how they want, the less needy <br/>\nthey&#39;ll act about it. The more you regulate, schedule and time them, the less <br/>\nthey will problem solve and the more obsessed they will act about their time <br/>\non it.<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>\nWhat&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>\n                           -Zilpha Keatley Snyder<br/>\nUnschooling support at pensacolaunschoolers.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50379,"nextTopicId":50508}}
