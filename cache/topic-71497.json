And the nice thing about unschooling in general, whether<br/>\nit&#39;s with kids who would be labeled something-or-other or kids who would be<br/>\nlabeled &quot;normal&quot; is that you basically give them the gift of time to learn<br/>\nat their own pace. Even within one child, they might gobble up some things,<br/>\nand take other things slower. Or gobble up things for awhile and then lay<br/>\noff.<br/>\nI notice in observing my kids that their interest in things tends to go in<br/>\nspurts. And, interestingly enough, it&#39;s when they&#39;re doing &quot;nothing&quot; in a<br/>\ngiven &quot;subject&quot; that the real progression happens. For instance, my son will<br/>\nbe really interested in manipulating numbers for awhile, and ask me tons of<br/>\nquestions about numbers, write down problems and figure them out, etc. Then<br/>\nhe&#39;ll go into a period where he does &quot;nothing&quot; visible with numbers at all.<br/>\nBy the next time I hear him talking about numbers, he can do some more<br/>\namazing manipulations than he could do before. The last time this happened,<br/>\nhe could suddenly understand fractions and what they represented. In a<br/>\nschooling model, these times of doing &quot;nothing&quot; are to be avoided at all<br/>\ncosts, yet I can see that for at least my child, *that* is when the true<br/>\nlearning is occurring, during those times when the concepts go internal in<br/>\nhis head and he can let them percolate there for awhile.<br/>\nAlso, I think kids look for different amounts of challenge at different<br/>\npoints, based on what their needs are at the moment (when they&#39;re given this<br/>\nfreedom to do so). Yesterday, my 3 year old grabbed my old college poetry<br/>\ntextbook and for an hour insisted that I read her Shelley and Longfellow and<br/>\nFrost. Later, I heard her reciting some lines from the poems to herself.<br/>\nNow, that could look &quot;gifted&quot; if I wanted to look at it that way. This<br/>\nmorning, she&#39;s playing &quot;Jumpstart Preschool&quot; on the computer, which involves<br/>\ncoloring in numbered squares. She&#39;s been able to use this particular program<br/>\nfor at least a year, so I could choose to look at it as something &quot;beneath&quot;<br/>\nher level, or &quot;behind&quot; where she should be. Neither of those ways of looking<br/>\nat her is especially helpful to where she&#39;s actually at.

The school system put him in the <br/>\nALT school for three months to punish him.
