Some environments are less<br/>\nhealthy than others and I think it can be hard for children to separate<br/>\nthemselves from their parents, emotionally.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother was very controlling.  She also used food as a reward,  (woof!)<br/>\nas comfort, and the lack of food as a punishment.  She was a &quot;clean your<br/>\nplate or else&quot;  mom.<br/>\nNone of us have food issues like weight problems or bingeing, but we all<br/>\nstill like our comfort foods.  <br/>\nMy dad was a ( insert anything you like here ) aholic, when I say jump,<br/>\nyou ask how far on the way up, dad.  <br/>\nWe all fit into the normal category.  We all left home as soon as<br/>\npossible.  My sister got married, secretly, and moved out on her 18th<br/>\nbirthday, leaving my mom a note.  <br/>\nWe all turned out ok.  How, I don&#39;t know.&lt;g&gt;   It came out all right for<br/>\nall of us, but childhood was terrible.  None of my siblings had more than<br/>\none child and several made the choice not to have any.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe somehow, somewhere we got the message that our parents problems<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to be ours forever.  Leaving home meant leaving those issues<br/>\nbehind.<br/>\nI still hope for something better for kids than having to live for the<br/>\nday they can leave.<br/>\nBut it&#39;s an interesting topic,  and I still blame my mom for everything.<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28072,"nextTopicId":27987}}
