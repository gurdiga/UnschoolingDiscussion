I&#39;d much prefer they be exposed to chickenpox, as well as mumps and measles -- if such a thing were actually possible.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy oldest had chickenpox at age 3, when you could still find &#39;wild&#39; chickenpox.  Now, if a child has chickenpox, it&#39;s likely he got it from the vax strain, either his own shots or being exposed to some other child who was recently vaccinated.  I&#39;ve heard some real horror stories of cases of the pox caused by the vax, so I&#39;m not sure how well that would fit with my plan.  <br/>\n <br/>\nFor Andy, who&#39;s 8, we had the chance 2 summers ago to expose him when a friend&#39;s kids had chickenpox.  Unfortunately, he was scheduled to travel to Hawaii with his grandparents two weeks later, so it would have been a really irresponsible time for me to expose him, and by association everyone he came into contact with on a plane.  As well, our entire household (except me) had recently survived a nasty virus that landed our Dan, then 17 mos, in the hospital with unexplained seizures.  I&#39;ve always suspected that illness was the result of exposure at a playground (counting backwards the incubation period we had), perhaps even a recently vaxed child.  Since then, I&#39;ve begun to think maybe only after Dan&#39;s 5yo.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIf the boys reach late adolescence without ever having had pox, mumps, or measles, I&#39;ll explain to them the risks of childhood diseases in adulthood and leave it to them to decide if they&#39;d like to be vaxed.  In spite of the recent media coverage, it&#39;s currently not safe (or possible) to be vaxed for whooping cough after age 7, so it&#39;s a non-issue in adulthood.<br/>\n <br/>\nPersonally, I survived both measles, mumps (5x) and chickenpox, with no lasting effects.  Both my parents and all their siblings (11 kids total, living poor in Okla & West VA) survived those plus whooping cough (pertussis).  My Mom survived polio as a nursing infant, with no lasting effects.  I&#39;m not terribly worried about them being unvaxed, but I&#39;d be happier if they had the opportunity to acquire natural lifelong immunities to the childhood illnesses.<br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n <br/>\n*******<br/>\n <br/>\ndoes there come a time when you expose them if you can?<br/>\nIs there an age when you try to have them get it if possible or just live and see what happens on it&#39;s own?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

He in non-vaccinated. I would prefer that he get a natural-<br/>\nborn exposure to the chicken pox in childhood. Obviously this is the <br/>\nsafest, healthiest way to endure them. Especially since the vaccine <br/>\nWEARS OFF in some unknown number of years leaving the &quot;vaccinated&quot; <br/>\nchild dangerously older!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had several issues however. My husband was not SURE that he had <br/>\nthe pox in childhood. He thought there may have been a pox or two. We <br/>\nhad him tested immediatedly to determine his risk of exposure. IF HE <br/>\nHAD NOT BEEN IMMUNE, IT WOULD BE VERY DANGEROUS FOR HIM (AT 45Y/O) TO <br/>\nLIVE WITH A CHILD WITH CHICKEN POX. The longer/greater the exposure <br/>\nthe worse the case of pox is. We co-sleep. This meant he could choose <br/>\nto live elsewhere while our son had the pox (basically two weeks) or <br/>\nchoose to get a limited exposure AT THE SAME TIME, if we chose to <br/>\nexpose our son. Then my husband&#39;s case of pox would be more likely to <br/>\nbe less severe than it would be from our son exposing him <br/>\nclosely/greatly. (Basically, the first person in a houshold has a <br/>\nless severe case, subsequent people in the same household have worse <br/>\ncases due to duration of exposure.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother issue is consent. This is one of the reasons we do not <br/>\nvaccinate in the first place. The risks of vaccine exposure is <br/>\nuncertain, knowingly injecting toxins in our child with some <br/>\nassumed/questionable benefits did not allow our child to choose this <br/>\nrisk for himself. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll the documentation on autism and vaccines is profound but <br/>\nunresolved. But the horrible history of the vaccine SYSTEM making <br/>\nvaccines safer YEARS after the manufactures KNOW the vaccines and <br/>\ntheir ingredients are toxic is fraudulent at best. And the system <br/>\nrequires no ACCOUNTABILITY on the manufactures part. The manufactures <br/>\nof vaccines are legally immune from lawsuits due to this fraudulent <br/>\nsystem. Unfortunately, pediatricians are only superficially aware of <br/>\nthe lack of recourse that families damaged by vaccines have. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out the government site VAERS. It is the vaccine adverse <br/>\neffects reporting system. It documents the billions of dollars that <br/>\nthe government, not the manufactures have paid due to CHILDREN <br/>\nDAMAGED BY VACCINES. The government actively encourages vaccines, but <br/>\nat children&#39;s expense. <br/>\n<br/>\nOff my soap box.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband had immunities. We decided we would wait until our son was <br/>\nable to understand the risks, in simple terms, and choose for himself <br/>\nwhether he wanted to be exposed. I considered this the same issue of <br/>\nconsent that kept me from vaccinating him in the first place. My <br/>\nawareness of the details allows me to attempt to give him an <br/>\nobjective understanding of the risks/benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgreed, he is allowed the same choice with vaccines theoretically. <br/>\nBut the horrible history of the vaccine system can not be expressed <br/>\nobjectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nMind you, I am a health professional with nearly twenty years of <br/>\nexperience and read volumes of data related to this decision before <br/>\nand after our son was born. <br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@b...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just wondering about something.

They didn&#39;t require the chicken pox vaccine when the 13  year old was little, but I waited to get her naturally exposed, and she got them (mildly) in first grade, with only one faint pox scar on her cheek.  My 8 year old still has not gotten them, probably because everyone has gotten vaccinated by now.  I think I will go ahead and have her vaccinated, because my concern is that the older she gets, the likelier that she will come down with a more severe case that either causes severe scarring, or major health concerns.  Medical people have warned me that they have seen cases come through their office of children who have died or been blinded by severe cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"OT chicken pox","postDate":"1090517524","msgId":96666,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNzEwMWM0NzAxMSRjZTAxZGNjMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":96667,"prevInTime":96665,"nextInTime":96667,"topicId":96666,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just wondering about something.

Those of you who don&#39;t vaccinate for chicken pox and hasn&#39;t had a child get them, does there come a time when you expose them if you can?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there an age when you try to have them get it if possible or just live and see what happens on it&#39;s own?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids aren&#39;t vaccinated and the younger 3 have never had chicken pox. In the next 6 months they will all be 10, 9 and 4. I seem to have an immunity although I was never tested. If I do have that immunity, my kids may have it also. My oldest has had them before the others were born. Someone I know of has a child with them now and I&#39;m wondering about exposing them like I&#39;ve heard people do while the kids are young.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96774,"nextTopicId":96459}}
