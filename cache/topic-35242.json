I have a dd almost 4 shannon and husband rick.  We <br/>\nlive on a 40 acre farm in TX with a young mother and her 2 year old <br/>\nson.  We plan on unschooling. We find living like we do there are <br/>\nmultiple opportunities for learning.  I was reading back a bit and <br/>\nso will also say that we don&#39;t have television.  We have limited <br/>\nelectricity.  Our goal here is to be self sufficient.  I look <br/>\nforward to sharing with everyone and picking up some interesting <br/>\nideas.  As it is, the kids love reading to each other.  There are <br/>\nseveral books that Shannon will &#39;read&#39; to Kiryn and vice versa.  <br/>\nKiryn is very verbal and articulate and will make up stories for <br/>\nShannon.  &#39;Why&#39; is his favorite word. We find opportunities to teach <br/>\nmath while sorting beans and baby chicks and fractions while baking <br/>\nbread.  Shannon is still pretty preoperational but is beginning to <br/>\nget two halves make one whole.  We are also introducing Spanish and <br/>\nplay a game called What is it? Que es esso? <br/>\nShannon also likes to sew with her little sewing kit.. and kiryns <br/>\nfavorite is carrying around his little hammer and fixing things. He <br/>\nwill often be found wearing a green velvet dress with shannon <br/>\nplaying pretty pretty princess although right now they are <br/>\npretending to kill a pig and cook it for dinner.<br/>\nSoon the garden will go in and they will help along with that.  We <br/>\nalso teach botany as we take walks out in the field and shannon can <br/>\nidentify a dozen trees and plants and about half that many animal <br/>\ntracks(deer, rabbit, goat, dog, raccoon, goose).<br/>\nso a little glimpse into our day...<br/>\nhappy to meet everyone.<br/>\nki</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35304,"nextTopicId":5226}}
