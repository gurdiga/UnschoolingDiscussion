We try out all car seats in<br/>\neach car before buying the seat.  They are<br/>\nused to it, and even commented to me that few<br/>\npeople do this, but enough do that they won&#39;t<br/>\nlook at you funny.  Do take out each model,<br/>\nand try it in your car, in each of the cars<br/>\nyou will be using.  Also, try it in different<br/>\nseats, middle seat, etc.  it&#39;s really worth<br/>\nit!  But don&#39;t expect them to help you, they<br/>\ncan carry but they have no idea how to put<br/>\nthem in.<br/>\n<br/>\njoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps I can even take a couple of models<br/>\n&gt; at a time, and ask for an<br/>\n&gt; employee to come with me to show me how it<br/>\n&gt; goes in the car (not only will<br/>\n&gt; they not go with me, they wouldn&#39;t know how<br/>\n&gt; it goes in the car).
