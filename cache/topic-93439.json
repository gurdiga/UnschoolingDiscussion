I said that usually people didn&#39;t die unless<br/>\nthey were really old and very very sick.  He asked if kids died and again I<br/>\nsaid that usually that didn&#39;t happen.  He said that that happened only if<br/>\nelectricity happened.  He asked dh if i would die and dh said that I was<br/>\nhealthy and and young (not that young-older than most all the other moms but<br/>\nwho&#39;s counting).  He said that we stay new bc we put on sunscreen.  I&#39;m not<br/>\nsure where that came from..  Later he came out to me and said he was sad bc<br/>\nhe didn&#39;t want to die.  I said that he didn&#39;t have to worry about that bc<br/>\nthat rarely happened unless there was an accident or the child was very very<br/>\nvery sick.<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt at a loss.  I remember  reading that Bruno Bettelheim (child<br/>\npsychologist) saying that young kids need some cosmology to help them  make<br/>\nsense of a chaotic world.  I didn&#39;t have any cosmology to offer.  I did say<br/>\nwe were all energy before we were born and after but that didn&#39;t hold much<br/>\npromise for him and dropped it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHey death sucks.  What can I do but go through this with him.  The hard part<br/>\nwas asking him what he thoguth and then him asking again was that true and<br/>\nseeing his pain.  In the end he seemed to be calmed by hearing how rare it<br/>\nwas.  I gave us both ignacia (homeopathic for grief)and we went to bed.  He<br/>\nhasn&#39;t brought ti up again.  I&#39;d love to hear what others have said who<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have a religious perspective to offer..<br/>\n<br/>\nAlison</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93478,"nextTopicId":93503}}
