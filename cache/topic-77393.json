I think anyone is probably going to <br/>\nget <br/>\ndefensive if attacked, although Oom seemed to be responding without <br/>\nattacking back. I also think picking apart posts really takes things <br/>\nout <br/>\nof context and leads to unintended nastiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree that spanking is wrong. I got ONE  &quot;swat&quot; with a <br/>\npaddle <br/>\nas punishment in Jr. High School from the principal( I hope that this <br/>\nis <br/>\noutlawed now--it was punishment for tardiness) and I&#39;m still mad at <br/>\nthat <br/>\nman today, twenty years on! It wasn&#39;t the pain--although it did <br/>\nhurt--but the utter humiliation and rage I felt towards him <br/>\nafterwards. <br/>\nI used to like him, too-- but never again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I learned about myself when I first started attending La Leche <br/>\nmeetings (breastfeeding group), and I believe this to be true of most <br/>\nof <br/>\nus, is that you do not always really Hear what is being said until <br/>\nyou <br/>\nare ready to hear it. There may come a time when someone who spanks <br/>\n(or <br/>\noccasionally slaps) is ready to &quot;hear &quot; what opponents say against <br/>\nit. <br/>\nThen he or she will remember those gentle voices and , I hope , stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nE.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nE.  I wanted to add that I too have read everything I can find that <br/>\nSandra has written on the web.  I thought how wonderful, what a <br/>\ngentle caring person.  THEN I came here, my thoughts on her <br/>\npersonally are quite different after &quot;experiencing&quot; her &quot;in person&quot; <br/>\nso to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think she does a lot of good things with her children and raised <br/>\nthem remarkably by the evidence of her writings but it sure changed <br/>\nmy mind about her as a person.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know people here who&#39;ve met her rave about her kindness and <br/>\ngentleness.  I haven&#39;t seen it.  I HAVE seen lots of rude, lots of <br/>\nname calling, lots of taking things out of context and then she <br/>\neditorializes it and tells YOU what you wrote or were thinking and <br/>\nthen every one of course (well MOST everyone) then reads what Sandra <br/>\nwrote as the FACTS and that&#39;s how life goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yet again Sandra wonders why others stay if we dislike the list <br/>\nso much.  Here&#39;s the answer from my standpoint.  I don&#39;t dislike the <br/>\nlist.  I dislike Sandra, she&#39;s a small part of the list.  She&#39;s rude <br/>\nwhen she need not be, she&#39;s short and hateful often as well, <br/>\nespecially to new people.  To some she&#39;s not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI stay because there are decent kind people who are willing to put <br/>\nout a hand to help someone along the path of this unschooling <br/>\njourney.  There is always much to learn and hearing the experience of <br/>\nthose who&#39;ve gone before is helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally, am not here because of Sandra, but in SPITE of her at <br/>\ntimes.  If I were only here to complain about how someone posts or <br/>\ntreats others then I would probably have left a long time ago.  If I <br/>\nonly wanted to take advantage of Sandra&#39;s wisdom, I could just read <br/>\nher articles over and over online for free.  If I had a problem I <br/>\ncould probably find something she&#39;s written or linked to it online.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe nastiness is just a small part of the list it&#39;s always (again let <br/>\nme clarify ALMOST always) a new person finding their way and the same <br/>\npeople attacking and then saying they never attacked, were never <br/>\nrude, etc.  Seems like it&#39;s a cycle.  When one stops posting in <br/>\ndefense of the non attack (or gets moderated forever) then a new <br/>\nperson fills the slot very quickly as the new, never will be right, <br/>\nwickedly wrong, stop posting or pay the price candidate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t the first, and I wasn&#39;t the last and I&#39;m sure this last <br/>\nattack will not be the last either.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was hard for me to accept others being treated like this, but it&#39;s <br/>\ngoing to happen.  No one can stop it.  It will only cause the poster <br/>\nto leave or get moderated or just stop posting all together, those <br/>\nare the options once you&#39;ve raised the ire of certain people here.  <br/>\nIt won&#39;t change, no matter how much any of us suggest, cajole, offer, <br/>\ndemand, insinuate or plead.  In a way it&#39;s bullying at it&#39;s finest <br/>\nisn&#39;t it?  The one part doesn&#39;t see any bullying at all, others feel <br/>\nthe lumps and bruises for days and fade back into the background <br/>\nwhere they&#39;ve been sent.<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept we are adults, free to leave anytime to avoid the bullying but <br/>\nin leaving we might miss something very important that helps us <br/>\nachieve our goals of raising our children in the best unschooling way <br/>\npossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we make a choice, stay and learn, grit our teeth at times or just <br/>\nleave.  It&#39;s sad but that&#39;s the way it is, it unfortunately is simply <br/>\nnot going to change it seems.  If one does not see a problem their <br/>\nwill be no fix.  Just as was posted that Oom saw no problem with <br/>\nsmacking her child in such a situation so she couldn&#39;t be regretful <br/>\nnor change, it goes both ways.  If no one &quot;sees&quot; it as a problem and <br/>\nthey very vehemently deny there is one, then it will never change.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77061,"nextTopicId":77441}}
