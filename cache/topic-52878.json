Disney, LearningSmith, and <br/>\nothers have time capsules you can buy, and then complete at the party. They <br/>\ntraditionally include prepared cards or pages where you fill in things like <br/>\nwhat is cool, slang words, popular activities, clothes, games, fashion, <br/>\nvacations, etc... You could make a scrapbook using acid-free paper and <br/>\nspecial pens, document family trees or histories, etc.. or provide <br/>\nthree-ring binders and pages and then let people decorate and include what <br/>\nthey want.<br/>\nYou might have everyone bring newspapers and magazines to cut things out <br/>\nof, or you could download images from the net and provide copies for people <br/>\nto use. You could also have a design a time capsule contest and have people <br/>\nbring time capsules they previously created and just tell the other guests <br/>\nwhat is in them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome ideas about what you might want to include are:<br/>\n·       newspapers or magazines (or just covers) about historical, social, <br/>\nor cultural events<br/>\n·       pictures of famous people or your family<br/>\n·       pictures of cars, pets, or other hobby-oriented things<br/>\n·       cultural artifacts (like early electronic things)<br/>\n·       descriptions of people - average sizes and shapes - maybe a chart <br/>\nof how people have gotten taller or are living longer<br/>\n·       want ads or personal columns<br/>\n·       price quotes for housing, cars, transportation, other durable goods<br/>\n·       sample menus and vacation planning guides<br/>\n·       for small kids - their favorite baby toy, bath toy, outfit, etc...<br/>\n·       for sports fanatics, every jersey they have ever worn while playing <br/>\nteam sports<br/>\n·       for girl scouts, all their daisy, brownie, junior, cadet, and <br/>\nsenior uniforms or badges<br/>\n·       for lovers, a timeline of their relationship history and plans for <br/>\nthe future<br/>\n<br/>\nThe timeline could be drawn on a roll of butcher paper (available at art or <br/>\nteacher supply stores), and images that represent each era (from the <br/>\ncostume list) can be found at the library.
