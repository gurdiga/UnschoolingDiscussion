It doesn&#39;t feel good to me, but I don&#39;t want to insist <br/>\nthat she stay at home!<br/>\nI need two things, one is to ask if anyone has had the experience of your child <br/>\nwanting to go to school and you telling them no, they can&#39;t? How did that work <br/>\nfor you? I am considering it but it doesn&#39;t follow my phiolosophy of &quot;child-led <br/>\nlearning&quot; at all!<br/>\nThe second is that I have told her that if she wants to go back to school she <br/>\nneeds to catch up in reading and writing (her math is fine!). Is there a web site <br/>\nwhere I can get worksheets for 5th grade level writing and a list of 5th grade <br/>\nlevel reading so she can get an idea of what she will be expected to do so <br/>\nshe can go into this either prepared from spending the next 6 months studying <br/>\nhard or she can realize that school is not as understanding as I am about <br/>\nletting her learn at her own pace (unschooling/child-led learning) I&#39;m not <br/>\nreally trying to scare her into giving up the idea of school, but I don&#39;t want to <br/>\ngo to all the trouble of getting her back into school for her to then realize how <br/>\ngood she has it at home and ask to homeschool again! I&#39;m tired of the back <br/>\nand forth!!!<br/>\nAlso is there anything else like social scinces, sciences, etc... that you all think <br/>\nshe should definately know by now that she might still be scetchy on that I <br/>\nneed to insist she learns before she goes to school? Like do they have to <br/>\nhave memorized the names of the 50 states or names of presidents or <br/>\nanything like that?<br/>\nI love the idea of child-led learning, but the whole concept I believe is <br/>\ncontigent on long term homeschooling, not going back and forth in and out of <br/>\nschool! Am I wrong? <br/>\nThanks for any help!<br/>\nDenise</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111307,"nextTopicId":111328}}
