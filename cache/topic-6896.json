My littles shower with us all the time and have a lot of fun with it, but she will get used to it if you persist and take it nice and easy and make it fun.  Sometimes I will see the kids safe in the adjoining room to the shower, close the door so they can&#39;t run off, and take a quick one with the bathroom door open so I can hear and see them.
