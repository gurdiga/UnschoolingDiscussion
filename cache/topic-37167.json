Been lurking for a while, thought I&#39;d jump in with my intro. We&#39;re a<br/>\nfamily of natural learners, I&#39;m Cheryl, dh Jay, dd Jayme, 17 and ds<br/>\nJ.L., 13, with many children waiting in heaven.  We are presently, for<br/>\nthe past 10 years, living in Pa.  Neither of our children have ever<br/>\nattended school and so far, they have decided not to let college<br/>\ninterfere with their learning.  We love our lifestyle of learning and<br/>\nenjoy the freedom it gives.  (All of which has been  progressively<br/>\nlearned, as my dh and I were, at first, perfect products of public<br/>\nschooling.)  Although I personally feel I am way over 40 years behind in<br/>\ndiscovering this freedom and constantly want to know *everything*,<br/>\nyesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI for those that worry as I did in the beginning. (from reading some<br/>\nemails.)  My children were both different from myself in that they<br/>\nweren&#39;t reading &quot;steadily&quot; until the age of 11 and 12 respectively.<br/>\nWhen I first worried about this, my dh informed me that he never<br/>\n&quot;enjoyed&quot; reading and read poorly until he found Sci Fi books in the<br/>\neleventh grade.  My younger sis and db both admonished me for worrying<br/>\nabout reading and spelling.  Reminding me that they also were poor<br/>\nreaders and spellers &quot;during school years&quot;.  However they both went on<br/>\nin life and have great careers and families.  Picking up what they<br/>\nneeded when they had a &quot;use&quot; for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayme became a voracious reader at age 11.  However, my dd has been only<br/>\nbeen enjoying writing for the last 3 years since finding a friend who<br/>\nbecame her email pal.  This was also when her spelling improved as she<br/>\n&quot;had a desire/need&quot; to be understood.  She&#39;d also kept very sporadic<br/>\njournals from a young age but only recently *enjoyed* writing and is<br/>\nkeeping her journal regularly these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ds, this year, has found writing lists for his pokemon cards<br/>\ninteresting.  I&#39;ve seen amazing improvements in his handwriting.  One<br/>\nday recently, he was drawing and came running downstairs yelling, &quot;Look,<br/>\nmy fine motor skill have kicked in, I can draw!&quot;  LOL  It was true, he<br/>\nhad noticed that he was able to control his hand and was now able to do<br/>\nbetter curves.  Before this day, his drawings, although good, were done<br/>\non graph paper and consisted of mechanical type drawings of robots,<br/>\nplanes, etc.  His reading has been improving steadily as well.  He is<br/>\nmore the &quot;technical book&quot; style reader.  Give me the information, I&#39;m<br/>\nnot here to loligag, type.  *I&#39;ve read that a child should acquire fine<br/>\nmotor skills before reading, otherwise learning is a pain and not well<br/>\nretained.*<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are a magazine family as well as books.  I&#39;ve enjoyed &quot;HEM&quot; for<br/>\nseveral years now.  Hi, Helen.  We miss &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;<br/>\ntremendously.  I didn&#39;t notice any mention lately of the recently<br/>\nstarted magazine &quot;Life Learning&quot; nor did I see it in the archives.  Hope<br/>\nit&#39;s ok to talk about it and some of their articles.(?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI received my second copy of this magazine last week.  It is<br/>\ndelightful.  Though not as thick yet as others, so far I have been<br/>\nthoroughly enjoying it.  Of course, anyone that knows me, early on<br/>\nrealizes I&#39;m extremely partial to John Taylor Gatto.  As the magazine&#39;s<br/>\nwriters include this well known author and some of Pennsylvania&#39;s own,<br/>\nsuch as Christine Gable from Natural Learners Center in Marietta, I<br/>\nwanted to pass copies out to my relatives and friends.  I called the<br/>\ncompany when I received my sample and asked if they could send me more<br/>\nsample copies for the members of my monthly support group meeting.  They<br/>\ndid and it was really well received by my group.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first issue, John makes no bones about schools and the &quot;school at<br/>\nhome&quot; mentality.  I don&#39;t know if John&#39;s article from the March/April<br/>\nmagazine titled, &quot;Schools Do Violence to Children...& Society&quot; is posted<br/>\nsomewhere online, but it was spectacular, as his all are. ;-)  Once<br/>\nagain laying out where schools went wrong and the multitude of error<br/>\nstacked upon error.  The worst mistake being the connection of school to<br/>\nwork.  Does STW- School to Work sound familiar?  It&#39;s REAL prevalent<br/>\n<br/>\nhere in Pa.  So is their switching from Diploma&#39;s to Certificates of<br/>\nMastery. :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same months issue included an article by Jan Hunt, &quot;&#39;Leaning<br/>\nDisability&#39; A Rose by Another Name&quot;.  I love the opening analogy of a<br/>\nplant nursery assistant trying to make all the roses bloom the same<br/>\nweek.  Hah, the entire article was good, but the opening was hilarious.<br/>\nSo true.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe May/June issue includes Wendy Presnitz&#39;s article &quot;College...How to<br/>\nGet There and If You Need to Go&quot;  She speaks of  colleges recruiting<br/>\nself-educated students and some alternative, progressive post-secondary<br/>\ninstitutions.  I was glad to see mentioned that not all natural learners<br/>\ncare to go to college.  I&#39;ve noticed the tendency among autodidacts to<br/>\nquestion the &quot;need&quot; for higher facilities of *indoctrination*.  Many<br/>\nI&#39;ve met are finding no reason to change their life style of natural<br/>\nlearning and choose as she said, &quot;a life of simplicity&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully this company will grow.  They already have added to their<br/>\nonline sight.  I hope in the future, they will post online some of the<br/>\nmagazine&#39;s articles.
