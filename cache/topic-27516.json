The majority of my dd&#39;s<br/>\ntoys are older 2nd hand stuff. She still has and plays<br/>\nwith some of my old FP stuff, dolls (and clothes for<br/>\nthem) that were mine, and doll house furniture that my<br/>\nmom made for me. The only toys she&#39;s had that have<br/>\nbroken are modern ones that she&#39;s gotten! She even has<br/>\nan original Tinkertoys set that I found at a garage<br/>\nsale for $3. Now if only I could find a metal kitchen<br/>\nset like I had (stove, sink and refrigerator)! I<br/>\nplayed with that for years. I guess I&#39;ll just continue<br/>\nwith my plans to make her a wooden one, &#39;cause I<br/>\ncertainly can&#39;t afford to buy her one!<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan (mum to Tamzin, 7yo)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;ve noticed that toys are becoming more and &gt;more<br/>\n&gt;close-ended, that <br/>\n&gt;they are being designed so they can only be &gt;played<br/>\n&gt;with in a few ways.  <br/>\n&gt;That way, we now have to buy 4 or 5 toys to have &gt;the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>use of one, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;well-designed toy from 30 years ago.  I really<br/>\n&gt;noticed this with Fisher-Price <br/>\n&gt;toys.
