What you&#39;re saying makes a <br/>\nlot of sense because I think a lot of discussions in person are like that.  <br/>\nWe relate our experiences, problems, successes, and so forth, and we all <br/>\nlearn from one another about life.  I am sorry if I sounded too argumentive <br/>\nmyself in my posts. <br/>\n      I thought about some of these issues during the past couple of days <br/>\nwhile I was gone and I think I realized what my feelings are.  I believe it <br/>\nis normal and appropriate for people to have strong convictions about certain <br/>\nissues.  I believe it is far better and more constructive to explain, even <br/>\nstrongly, why one believes a certain thing is wrong without attacking the <br/>\npeople themselves or their characters.    This can be so painful (I&#39;ve <br/>\nexperienced some of it myself in years gone by) and either makes the person <br/>\nfeel even more down about him/herself or evokes a defensive, angry reaction.<br/>\n     I don&#39;t believe we should judge or categorize people themselves as <br/>\nselfish, stupid, losers, whatever labels.  We don&#39;t know what is in their <br/>\nhearts and it is so easy to then pat ourselves on the back for being BETTER <br/>\nthan those people.<br/>\n     In thinking about what has worked for myself and my family, I can say <br/>\nthat a simple lifestyle, more time than money, days full of learning and <br/>\ngrowing for every person (including adults) according to his/her passions at <br/>\nthe time, helping others in whatever ways we can, and communicating with many <br/>\ndifferent people...these are all things that have made our lives so much <br/>\nbetter.  I feel that there is still so much to learn and so much room for <br/>\nimprovement for myself.  <br/>\n     Anyway, hope these thoughts aren&#39;t too random to be cohesive....<br/>\n<br/>\n      Lucy in Calif.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Whyner@aol.com","from":"Whyner@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Xh7JwwyZ2YXSdsCOVH9zVKGZYF7FlULu4pu03hqXHXo8N6QSiiG7g47rxK-ASH34oobX2QY","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] thought provoking debate vs. fighting","postDate":"962377564","msgId":10328,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc2LmIwYjI2Ny4yNjhlMTE1Y0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10249,"nextInTopic":10405,"prevInTime":10327,"nextInTime":10329,"topicId":10249,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"No, i think you re right on... but i do have to say that after 6 years on the internet i find that tone is often read into things where none was intended...","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-735485799\">No, i think you&#39;re right on... but i do have to say that after 6 years on the <br/>\ninternet i find that tone is often read into things where none was <br/>\nintended... people have often been put off and even incensed by things i&#39;ve <br/>\nsaid... i think sometimes they are coming into the conversation with their <br/>\nown personal baggage, if you will, that can trigger defensive emotional <br/>\nresponse... it&#39;s a hard one... happens all the time in email groups from my <br/>\nown personal experience... usually it ends up with &quot;rules&quot; which i am averse <br/>\nto, or it ends up with someone &quot;unsubscribing,&quot; which is of course their <br/>\nchoice... i opt for neither... and i think you suggestion of sharing personal <br/>\nexperiences is a good one... i find that when i am offering my opinion and i <br/>\nmake it about &quot;me&quot; rather than attacking someone, that it communicates my <br/>\nintent far better... unfortunately, some of us over identify with our <br/>\nopinions on an emotional level and respond inappropriately... although, as <br/>\nyet, i haven&#39;t really seen any of this in the unschooling list... maybe i <br/>\nshould read on...<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n <br/>\n Maybe we can shift some of the way we pursue the threads to be more positive <br/>\nand<br/>\n productive.
