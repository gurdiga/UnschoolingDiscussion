It&#39;s fairly crude, but even <br/>\nthere, I see the note, and I feel in my hands whether I have an F instrument <br/>\nor a C instrument.  If I&#39;ve been just playing one for a whole hour, I&#39;m not <br/>\nthinking that anymore, but in the set of music we&#39;ve been doing lately I <br/>\nswitch between alto and soprano a fair amount.<br/>\n<br/>\nA G on the paper is a different combo of fingers depending which recorder I <br/>\nhave.  Good.  I&#39;m going.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I get to (on an alto, I&#39;ll use as an example) a low E, there are two <br/>\nequally good fingerings to use, and it depends which notes it&#39;s next to which <br/>\none I&#39;m going to use.  No sense moving three fingers when I can just move <br/>\none.  Other combos are better with the other fingering.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a fast run, I can use a trill/alternate fingering sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn my KÃ¼ng recorder, the high A is sharp, always, and so I shade that by <br/>\nputting my fourth finger, right hand, close to the surface of a hole.  If I&#39;m <br/>\nusing the Moeck or a plastic Yamaha, that A is fine without shading it down.  <br/>\nBut those other two have a harder time going above high C.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been playing that same recorder since I was 19, off and on, though, and <br/>\nI remember it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not abstraction, that&#39;s detailed particulars.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea that one note represents one set of fingerings isn&#39;t true of all <br/>\ninstruments.  Bass recorders famously have to be learned, each one, by each <br/>\nmusician.  The notes in the middle of the range are likely to be good as on <br/>\nhigher pitched recorders.  But when you get to the higher and lower notes you <br/>\nkinda have to find each one for that particular instrument.  It&#39;s not a wild <br/>\nsearch, there are likelihoods and physical (as in physics) realities.  But <br/>\nnobody here can say &quot;On any bass recorder, a low A is fingered like this.&quot;  <br/>\nThe most they can say is &quot;Might be, on an F bass, like this; try it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd still people play recorders!! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd people still love math, if they love it, because of the patterns and the <br/>\nflow of ideas and relationships between things, not because the formulas are <br/>\npretty on paper.  Because they liked and understood math first and THEN <br/>\nwanted to learn the notation so someone could show them some cool other <br/>\nstuff.  School&#39;s math methods can kill that dead for all but the lucky few <br/>\nwho understood math in their heads, on their fingers, on chessboards, or in <br/>\ntheir yards on the fencewire before they got there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132394532,"authorName":"Have a Nice Day!","from":"Have a Nice Day! &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"litlrooh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] music and math","postDate":"1044718634","msgId":58283,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWMyY2Y4NyRmNDZmODhjMCQ3YjdlNTI0NEBjZWxlcm9uMTc+","referencesHeader":"PEJBNkE5ODYyLjFERTElYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":58280,"nextInTopic":58291,"prevInTime":58282,"nextInTime":58284,"topicId":58280,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"THank you SO much for writing this.

For example, the &quot;A&quot; that is the<br/>\nsecond space on the treble clef is an open string on my violin.  But it&#39;s<br/>\nalso a stopped note on the two lower strings, and can be played with any of<br/>\nthe 4 fingers, for a total of 9 locations.

Okay.  I&#39;m a professional musician, and this is my concept<br/>\nof the steps.  The first 3 steps take about 3 seconds for me.  I&#39;ve spent<br/>\nentire lessons working through them with kids, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew music: <br/>\nStep 1: composer.  That affects the way I look at the music.  Not just in<br/>\ninterpretation, but also how I read the notes.  Ornaments (turns, trills,<br/>\nmordents, etc.) are read differently in differnet periods.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 2: key signature.  quick scan to see if it changes anyplace.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 3: time signature, and a glace above at the tempo marking.  Allegro is<br/>\na pretty abstract concept in itself (fast? how fast?).  select tempo.<br/>\nnegotiate with other people if necessary, or take a look at what the<br/>\nconductor wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 4: <br/>\nnotes.  I make a million decisions every minute as I play.  I take the notes<br/>\non the page and decide, while playing, where to play them on the instrument.<br/>\nThat&#39;s not interpretative, that&#39;s functional.  Can I reach the next note if<br/>\nI play this one here, with this finger.<br/>\n<br/>\nand so on. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; After that, there are many ways to play the same note on a particular<br/>\n&gt; instrument. Take the violin for example.  You can play a note, use vibrato, or<br/>\n&gt; use pizzacato, all of which is in the notation on the music.  But you are<br/>\n&gt; still playing the same note, and each symbol on the paper represents one<br/>\n&gt; thing, and the technique to play the music the way its written never changes,<br/>\n&gt; even though the style might.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hope that what I&#39;ve written above helps you understand why I say that<br/>\nthere are different techniques to play the notes the way they are written.<br/>\nAnd vibrato, for the record, is never written into the music I play.  That&#39;s<br/>\ndropped about the 2nd year of playing.  I make decisions about bow stroke,<br/>\nvibrato, and such myself.  But that&#39;s stylistic, which you aren&#39;t thinking<br/>\nof as technical.  I do, because there&#39;s a technical approach to each piece<br/>\nof style, but that&#39;s neither here nor there.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; In contrast to music, there are many technical ways to solve a single problem<br/>\n&gt; in math.  When adding, you can add from right to left, you can add from left<br/>\n&gt; to right, you can estimate and subract, you can mentally compute it in your<br/>\n&gt; head by any combination of these methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course.  But if you understand the CONCEPT of what you are trying to do,<br/>\nthan the notes fall into place.  If you understand the CONCEPT of the math<br/>\nproblem you are trying to solve, then you choose the technical way that<br/>\nmakes the most sense to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeginning players want to learn the technical steps without the concepts.<br/>\nIf it says this black dot, do I play D string with second finger?  Getting<br/>\nbeyond that is the first step to really playing music.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool children are told to learn the technical steps without the concepts.<br/>\nAnd then they forget the steps.  Getting beyond that is the route to really<br/>\nunderstanding math.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What difference does it make<br/>\n&gt; that you flip the fraction over and mulitply if you haven&#39;t got any idea WHY<br/>\n&gt; you would do that.
