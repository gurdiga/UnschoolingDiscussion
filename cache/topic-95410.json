After spending $37 for a Maya, and $27 for another one, I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to spend that for yet another one, since Dan was already 2, but I really needed on to travel.  I figured how hard could it be.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t have a sewing machine, so this looked even more challenging!  We went to the fabric store and chose a pretty fabric on markdown, for something like $3 a yard.  I bought 2.5 yards to be sure I&#39;d have enough tail on the sling.  At the craft store, I bought 2 metal craft rings -- I think they were 3&quot; inches across (75 cents).   Since all the sewing was going to be hand work, I made it the width of the fabric, using the selvage edge and only had to sew the ends.  I folded the fabric accordian-style (like my earlier slings), threaded it the rings to secure it and hand-sewed it down on the &#39;back&#39; of the fabric.  The other end of the sling threads thru the rings opposite direction of the first threading, and tightens up to fit you and baby, with a tail left for discreet nursing, naptime, etc.   It&#39;s kinda hard to explain how you thread the fabric thru the rings, but if you look at a Maya or other similar sling, you&#39;ll be able to figure it out.  I&#39;m just no good at working or<br/>\n describing things in the abstract, much more a tactile doer!<br/>\n <br/>\nAll in all, my sling cost me $12  -- including thread for sewing, and took me about 3 hrs.  With a machine, I could have done it in under an hour.  Admittedly, I used discount fabric, but it was just as strong as the Maya Sling I started with.  Dan and I used it all over Hawaii last summer, and he weighed 28lbs at the time.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.
