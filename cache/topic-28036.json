It&#39;s what children need. So someone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; suggesting &quot;I have come to the conclusion that control works for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my kids,&quot; is really a reinforment of the social norm.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The idea many are working towards is to throw away that idea and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; begin with a new base of operations, a new norm: the idea that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; control isn&#39;t necessary, that children will self-regulate when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; given the freedom to do so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joyce,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I firmly respect your opinion here BUT.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve considered myself an unschooler for 11 years now, ever since I<br/>\n&gt; first read John Holt and decided my oldest was not ever attending<br/>\n&gt; traditional school.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Over the years, I have had this idea forced on me on nearly every<br/>\n&gt; unschooling list I&#39;ve been on. I&#39;ve been called a control freak<br/>\n&gt; because I expect my children to make their beds and brush their<br/>\n&gt; teeth. My parenting has been attacked and I&#39;ve been told I certainly<br/>\n&gt; must not bea &quot;real unschooler&quot;. Now I&#39;m not saying that you are doing<br/>\n&gt; this, Joyce. I believe I understand the message of your post - With<br/>\n&gt; ideas about how to force and control children so readily available,<br/>\n&gt; it is important to put other messages out there (am I hearing you<br/>\n&gt; correctly?). I just want to voice an opinion that says please don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; narrowly define unschooling for me. For me, I know that experience<br/>\n&gt; plays a big part in life. For me, my experience is SOMETIMES more<br/>\n&gt; important, more vital than the opinions of my children. But I share<br/>\n&gt; it with them rather than lay down the law. This has been a life long<br/>\n&gt; effort of building a relationship and trust where my word means<br/>\n&gt; something to them. I do know more than they do in many areas but my<br/>\n&gt; trust in them bleeds through and affects both of our decisions. BUt<br/>\n&gt; if push came to shove, I am the parent and the authority in the<br/>\n&gt; household. I&#39;ve been known to force or manipulate to get kids off a<br/>\n&gt; plateu or to move them beyond a comfort level they&#39;ve stayed at a bit<br/>\n&gt; too long. I&#39;ve pushed them into activities that exposed them to ideas<br/>\n&gt; they thought they wouldn&#39;t like because I knew/felt there was value<br/>\n&gt; (and most of the time I was right). I consider these nudges to be<br/>\n&gt; parenting responsibilities. I&#39;ve helped my kids get over fears and<br/>\n&gt; opened their eyes to differences of opinion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For some, I know I don&#39;t live up to the title &quot;unschooler&quot;. But for<br/>\n&gt; me, it is a term still evolving and not one I&#39;m always comfortable<br/>\n&gt; with. Life-learner feels so much better. And if these nudges and<br/>\n&gt; authority keep me from the select group, so be it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hope this doesn&#39;t feel attacking, Joyce.

Am I understanding you as saying that Clonlara is a good place<br/>\n&gt; for textbook type learning? That has not been my experience or<br/>\n&gt; understanding, that&#39;s why I ask. I&#39;ve always known Clonlara to<br/>\n&gt; support whatever approach you wish to use, unschooling or something<br/>\n&gt; more traditional. Do you see it differently? Or am I misunderstanding<br/>\n&gt; you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; in peace,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Chris O&#39;Connor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 20<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 19 Nov 2001 05:00:16 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: chrisoco@...<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Whether Sandra is right or wrong...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Dan Conine&quot; &lt;dconine@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve known people who could egg on a spirited argument in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; armpits of the world, and walk away with everyone laughing. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t think Sandra does it on purpose. There isn&#39;t enough<br/>\n&gt; &gt; scientific method to her responses. Hers are all from her soul,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and the errors made at times add to the humanity of it all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So true, Dan. I had the pleasure of meeting Sandra a little over 4<br/>\n&gt; years ago when she agreed to speak at a conference here in Columbus.<br/>\n&gt; As a harried conference coordinator, I barely got time to say hello,<br/>\n&gt; but the response from our attendees said it all. Sandra was very well<br/>\n&gt; received and she spoke to the heart of the matter. Yes, she<br/>\n&gt; challenged people.. made them rethink what they accepted as given<br/>\n&gt; realities. But isn&#39;t that a lot of what home education and<br/>\n&gt; specifically unschooling is all about?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One thing I&#39;ve come to learn is that the most passionate people are<br/>\n&gt; often the ones who are the most difficult to get along with. But<br/>\n&gt; passionate people change the world and I&#39;m thankful for the Sandra&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; in it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW, Sandra... the &quot;I Hate Chris&quot; t-shirts are big sellers around<br/>\n&gt; here.

Sorry to reply before I had gotten all<br/>\n&gt; the way through my e-mails. If I &quot;hear&quot; you correctly, you are saying<br/>\n&gt; that Clonlara might be able to help the Dad who feels the need for<br/>\n&gt; textbooks and documentation? I can see that as they would<br/>\n&gt; apply &quot;credit&quot; for the work and give it the &quot;authority&quot; he seems to<br/>\n&gt; need. And in the meantime, Mom can still feel that she is following a<br/>\n&gt; more relaxed atmosphere while getting  back up from an &quot;authority&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Having such a supportive, relaxed husband is such a blessing....

We knew there wasn&#39;t much<br/>\n&gt; chance of seeing the meteor shower.  We laid on a tarp, wrapped in<br/>\n&gt; sleeping bags, my son&#39;s little warm hand in mine.  While we were hoping<br/>\n&gt; for the clouds to break,  we began to hear the geese.  They came over our<br/>\n&gt; little town in waves,  their bellies shimmering like silver ribbons<br/>\n&gt; against the grey sky.  The sound was indescribable.   I can&#39;t begin to<br/>\n&gt; imagine how many there were.  When our hot chocolate ran out and my son<br/>\n&gt; fell asleep, we carried him inside.  We went out again about two o&#39;clock<br/>\n&gt; and still the geese were coming.  We watched and listened for two more<br/>\n&gt; hours, before their numbers seemed to dwindle.  It was all so utterly<br/>\n&gt; magical.   Not one shooting star but thousands of shining geese, and they<br/>\n&gt; sang to us too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Deb L<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
