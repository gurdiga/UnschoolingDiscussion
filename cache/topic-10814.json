So what do you do when you ask them to take care <br/>\nof a chore (pickng up a mess of toys, say) and they throw a tantrum and <br/>\nrefuse?  I try  to get them involved, I make a game of it, I help out, I even <br/>\nwill tell them that the toy will be in time out for a few days if they cannot <br/>\ncare for it properly by putting it away when they are done with it.  <br/>\n <br/>\n But they are at the unreasonable and emotionally explosive age when they <br/>\ncannot always be talked into something, no matter how sound the reasoning.  <br/>\nIn the end, I get exponentially more stress and work than if I had just done <br/>\nit myself, and they seem to have gotten no easier to convince yet, most of <br/>\nthe time.  Plus I have a very hyperactive three year old, which complicates <br/>\nthings all the more.<br/>\n <br/>\n Nanci K&gt;&gt;  Boy, you said it!  My 3 yr old is so difficult these days--loves <br/>\nto dump out everything, but it&#39;s like pulling teeth  to get him to help clean <br/>\nup.  He will start crying and often throw a tantrum.  It is very frustrating. <br/>\n ~Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10813,"nextTopicId":10816}}
