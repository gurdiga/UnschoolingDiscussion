Picking up by 3:00 and working on <br/>\nhomework, doing projects, helping study for tests, fixing supper, and signing <br/>\npapers for the next day. Planning vacations around well...vacations! All the stress <br/>\nand worry and STUFF.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then folks think unschooling is easy. It&#39;s not. There&#39;s a lot of driving <br/>\nand playing and doing and thinking (and, for me, conferencing---but that&#39;s <br/>\nextra). We&#39;re VERY busy---and at the same time relaxed and laid back.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways, school is easier---ship &#39;em off and forget about them until <br/>\n3:00 when you then yell about their getting things done. Hands OFF.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling = hands ON.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard for folks to understand. It&#39;s an odd bird.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"jmcseals SEALS","from":"&quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] unschoolers group","postDate":"1055195029","msgId":73338,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjIwZGxiOXJYZzV3bFMwMDA2ODBjY0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":73333,"nextInTopic":73346,"prevInTime":73337,"nextInTime":73339,"topicId":73333,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I guess it could be worse...different?
