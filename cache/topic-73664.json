I am so <br/>\n&gt; easy going with the kids and am usually the one to calm situations if my <br/>\n&gt; husband gets a little antsy over something. Tonight it was the other way around. <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just wondering why this bothers me so much and although I won&#39;t let it <br/>\n&gt; happen again, I&#39;m worried that something else might make me react the same <br/>\n&gt; way.

Maybe the combination of a bad mood, her crying, and other things just <br/>\nmade you temporarily act like a jerk.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, I don&#39;t think children are exceptionally fragile (as opposed to <br/>\nsensitive). We&#39;re going to act like jerks sometimes, however hard we try not <br/>\nto. But it makes an enormous difference to apologize! And kids can see that <br/>\neven their usually calm moms can get into a shiity mood, make mistakes...and <br/>\nthen do what they need to mend the relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor kids (you know, all of them, just like all adults)  who get into bad <br/>\nmoods and act like jerks sometimes, this is not a bad thing to see. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can guarantee that something will make you respond the same way (or <br/>\nanother, new creative way) again, and you&#39;ll be disappointed about it. &#39;Cuz sometimes <br/>\nwe&#39;re all jerks. But we can all apologize.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72995,"nextTopicId":73479}}
