We are Washingtonians -- and we are essentially unschoolers<br/>\n(though we never use the term -- my book explains what we do, and you can call<br/>\nit whatever you want.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe laws in Washington are very simple and easy:<br/>\n<br/>\nParents are required to file an &quot;intent to homsechool&quot; between the time the<br/>\nchildren are 8 and 15.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents are allowed to homeschool if either:<br/>\n1.  One parent has at least the equivalent of about one year of college; or<br/>\n2.  One parent takes a &quot;homeschooling qualifying course&quot; -- these usually take<br/>\nabout 16 hours, either four evenings or a weekend -- and for the most part<br/>\nthey just put you in touch with resources in your community. They are almost<br/>\nalways taught by homeschoolers -- lots of my friends teach them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetween the ages of 8 and 15, children must either:<br/>\n1. Take a standardized test (from a list supplied by the Board of Education --<br/>\nit can be done at home -- and we have a wonderful organization in Spokane,<br/>\nWashington named the Family Learning Organization which can supply the tests);<br/>\nor<br/>\n2. Be evaluated by a &quot;certificated person&quot; (it&#39;s supposed to mean a qualified<br/>\nteacher).<br/>\nResults of these evaluations or tests are NOT, by law, to be shared with<br/>\nschool districts or board of education; they are meant for the parents&#39;<br/>\nbenefit only in evaluating their own children&#39;s progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s it.
