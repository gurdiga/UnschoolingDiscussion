We did<br/>\na little formal homeschool, but have really been unschooling most of the<br/>\ntime. I was wondering how, to what extent or even if, you explain<br/>\nunschooling to your children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I had explained it to my daughters, but every time we meet<br/>\nsomeone who asks how school&#39;s going, they have a totally blank look and say<br/>\nsomething like, &quot;Oh we didn&#39;t do anything today, we just played.&quot; I&#39;m<br/>\nreally glad that they don&#39;t realise that they&#39;re being &quot;schooled&quot; and that<br/>\nthey&#39;re free to play a great part of their day (I consider that to be a job<br/>\nwell done on my part) but at the same time their response worries me.  I<br/>\nreminded my older daughter today that many people don&#39;t understand how<br/>\nunschooling works- that we don&#39;t need lessons to learn, that they&#39;re<br/>\nlearning all the time even through games and just playing. She said, &quot;Well<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand how it works either.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHer response has left me speechless! Part of me agrees with Hafidha...<br/>\n&quot; They don&#39;t know that unschooling isn&#39;t about what you can<br/>\nnecessarily see on paper. It&#39;s about development, growth, independence<br/>\nand love of learning - none of which can be conveyed on television in<br/>\na 2 minute video segment.&quot;...  or in a 2 minute conversation. But I also<br/>\nfeel we need to let people know that we&#39;re not flakes who just let their<br/>\nchildren play all day. And I also think my daughter needs to understand<br/>\nwhat we&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;d love some feedback on this- what do you tell your children<br/>\nabout your homeschooling methods?  <br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nLyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8072,"nextTopicId":8132}}
