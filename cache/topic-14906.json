The ONLY<br/>\nphilosophy of education I ever learned was Whole Language, which dealt<br/>\nwith how children actually learn to read.  I am so grateful for that<br/>\nexperience now, actually, because it is  the only thing I have ever used<br/>\nfor my kids   (and which also, by the way, has been virtually banned in<br/>\nevery public school since it did not supposedly teach &#39;the basics&quot;, and<br/>\nallowed for children to read when they were  ready-too much time in the<br/>\nschools&#39; view , and not measurable enough by their standards).
