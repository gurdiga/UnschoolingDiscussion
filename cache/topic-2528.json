I once <br/>\ngot into a panic and wondered whether to send my younger son to Junior High <br/>\nschool. He had always found math very easy, both at home and when he was in <br/>\nschool, so he went to take the placement test for the accelerated math group <br/>\n(the other students had already taken it).  I did not hear from the school <br/>\nafterwards and eventually, at the end of the semester, rang the counselor <br/>\n(who, I might add, had been less than friendly in our initial contact). She <br/>\ndisappeared for ages, but eventually returned to the phone and said that he <br/>\nhad not passed the test. When I asked whether she knew why, she said somewhat <br/>\ncurtly that she didn&#39;t know - the math teacher had simply said he did not <br/>\npass.  She did not offer to let me speak to the math teacher herself. <br/>\n<br/>\nI knew that if he was not in the accelerated math group he would probably get <br/>\nbored and lose interest in math.  And that tipped the balance for me, as far <br/>\nas continuing to homeschool was concerned.  Homeschooling is definitely right <br/>\nfor him.  But I&#39;ve often wondered whether that counselor couldn&#39;t find the <br/>\nmath teacher, or didn&#39;t want homeschooling to have been successful and simply <br/>\nmade up the tale that he&#39;d failed.......<br/>\n<br/>\n                  Mattie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"RRAINENJ@xxx.xxx","from":"RRAINENJ@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"msnRXOOY1RaFhdpK0owM71xPxil4unySE1Y0tgHRiFjbmB38D0R67VAIMnrB6Qv9HBsSoZCiEg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: Summer of deschooling and still not there, help!","postDate":"940436527","msgId":3967,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yNjMuMzk2Ny45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3966,"nextInTopic":4133,"prevInTime":3966,"nextInTime":3968,"topicId":2528,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/20/99 8:53:32 AM CST, Hsmotgo@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2075381147\">In a message dated 10/20/99 8:53:32 AM CST, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Hsmotgo@...\">Hsmotgo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I still worry about the math, and just remember <br/>\n that on their last evaluation, the evaluator told me that he couldn&#39;t do <br/>\nthis <br/>\n year what he did last year, and I know he could, because we had worked on it <br/>\n for the month before the evaluation.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    After 2 years of homeschooling with textbooks and worksheets, this summer <br/>\nI was ready to throw in the towel.

But, If I hadn&#39;t made him, <br/>\nand believe me, they have always been read to, and see me read all the time, <br/>\nhe still wouldn&#39;t be reading, cause that&#39;s boring.  Wait, he can read, he <br/>\njust never said I am going to my room to read a book.  So,  to make a long <br/>\nstory even longer, I am reluctant to let go.  Guess I have the control streak <br/>\nin me from my mom.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to be so long, but geesh, I am kinda frustrated here<br/>\nTeresa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4092,"nextTopicId":4158}}
