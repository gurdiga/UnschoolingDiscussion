School<br/>\ntaxes force those people to pay twice to send their kids to school. They<br/>\nforce homeschooling parents to pay even though we don&#39;t use them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe argument about, &quot;It&#39;s so the poor kids will have schools...&quot; is specious<br/>\nbecause the schools where the poor kids go are always the worst. They are<br/>\ndenied education and it&#39;s BECAUSE of the schools they must attend.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust today, on another list, came news of a new national poll about<br/>\nvouchers. The results included the finding that HALF of all people who have<br/>\nschool age kids would accept vouchers in order to send their kids to a<br/>\nschool other than the gov&#39;t school.
