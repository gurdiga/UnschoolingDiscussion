Usually they go on a long time when they are about explosive issues. I <br/>\ndo not mind seeing (reading) a good debate but it can get a bit tiresome if <br/>\nit becomes less of a debate and more of an attack on someone&#39;s opinions, or <br/>\neven worse, someone&#39;s life or lifestyle. Being an unschooling list I think <br/>\nthe moderator/owner feels that there is learning in everything and all is <br/>\nunschooling. So looking at it that way it makes sense to let the debates go <br/>\non. I am not certain why Lynda said I like to play &quot;tag team.&quot; (Not even sure <br/>\nwhat that is, we just play tag here.) Anyway, I have expressed opinions on <br/>\nsubjects in the past just not as often as some. I guess Lynda and I do not <br/>\nagree too often. I try to have a live and let live attitude. I feel that I <br/>\nhave no right to tell others how to live their lives or tell them that what <br/>\nthey are doing is wrong. Lynda has not given me that same consideration. I no <br/>\nlonger feel free to express what is going on in our lives here unless I am in <br/>\nthe mood to defend it.<br/>\nThe majority of the time it is an interesting, fun list. Hang in there, till <br/>\na subject interests you. One will! <br/>\nHave a fun day<br/>\nCandace</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24060,"nextTopicId":24071}}
