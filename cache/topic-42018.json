People even left the list and formed a more<br/>\n&quot;gentle unschooling&quot; list (which I joined and eventually resubbed because I wasn&#39;t<br/>\nreally learning much). But at least during that arguing and bickering I was able to<br/>\nreally read a lot about what unschooling was/was not and I learned a lot. This<br/>\nbickering with Ned does not even give me that benefit, since we are not really debating<br/>\nunschooling! To be honest with you, I am not sure why he sticks around here if it is not<br/>\nwhat he wants it to be. There are so many lists out there that I have found if I am not<br/>\ngetting something from it, I go and find another list that suits my needs better.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill not sure why I am jumping in, except that I really do miss the ebb and flow of topics<br/>\nand information that was here before Ned started posting.

(not to unschooling, we have been unschooling for ten <br/>\nyears)  I am wondering if some other newbies are feeling the same <br/>\nway that I do about other posters being &quot;jumped on&quot; whenever they <br/>\nspeak out on subjects they are passionate about.  I read Ren&#39;s post <br/>\nor Bob&#39;s post or Ned&#39;s post and I think how wonderful it is that <br/>\nthey feel so strongly about something, and the next thing I know <br/>\nsomeone is telling them they are rude or that they are &quot;off-topic&quot; <br/>\nand basically they are asked to &quot;shut-up&quot; if they can&#39;t stay &quot;on-<br/>\ntopic&quot;.   I am confused.  I thought &quot;unschooling&quot; meant learning all <br/>\nyour life, and can&#39;t we learn all our life, right now as parents, <br/>\neven from those who don&#39;t speak quite the way we would like them <br/>\nto.  I learn from the posts on rap music even though I already know <br/>\nI don&#39;t want any of that kind of music being listened to by my <br/>\nchildren.  I learn from Ned&#39;s anti-school posts because, heck, I am <br/>\npretty anti-school myself.  Isn&#39;t everyone who UNschools?  (because <br/>\nif we weren&#39;t, wouldn&#39;t we just call it homeschooling or school at <br/>\nhome?)  I hated grade school, it was a living hell for me, but I <br/>\nloved high school and was very popular, but I still believe school <br/>\nis the worst place to LEARN in almost all cases!  If Ned comes <br/>\nacross as rude to some, if someone thinks Bob is personally <br/>\nattacking them, there are others of us (I can&#39;t be the only one!) <br/>\nwho really don&#39;t see it that way when we read a post.  If someone <br/>\nbrought up immunizations (and I will in a minute in a different <br/>\npost) or abortion, I would be frantically typing with my very strong <br/>\nand passionate views on these two topics, and in my frentic typing I <br/>\nmight come across to some as being &quot;rude&quot; only because these are <br/>\ntopics are so very close to my heart.  The institution of government <br/>\nschool is obviously a very important topic to Ned.  So what if you <br/>\ndon&#39;t like what he has to say about it, you are tired of it, or it <br/>\ngets &quot;too political&quot;?  It is still about unschooling, right?  Or am <br/>\nI wrong?   Isn&#39;t anything related to school topics naturally related <br/>\nto UNschool topics?    Am I the only one annoyed (and a little <br/>\nscared that it will happen to me, too, if I post) when someone takes <br/>\nanother person&#39;s post and picks it apart from one end to the other, <br/>\ntaking little pieces of it and responding as if it was written only <br/>\nto annoy them, and trying desperately to tear their thoughts apart <br/>\nin a way that makes it seem like they only want them to just SHUT-UP <br/>\nalready?<br/>\nNed, DO you have an agenda when you talk about the public school <br/>\nsystem?  Do you want our votes?   OR, is it just me that thinks <br/>\nthese kind of discussions are healthy for adult unschoolers, and <br/>\nthat controversy is part of an unschooler&#39;s life?   This mother at <br/>\nhome with five children likes a little jump-start to her gray matter <br/>\neach morning over her first cup of coffee.<br/>\nMy point is, and I do have one, why exactly do we keep jumping on <br/>\nNed and Bob and anyone else who seems to have very strong feelings <br/>\none way or the other on subjects that seem to me to fit very neatly <br/>\ninto an unschooling discussion?<br/>\nMary from IA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41914,"nextTopicId":42130}}
