You may","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1133772200\">Thank you Robyn,<br/>\n <br/>\nI agree and do feel as you have written,even more so now.<br/>\nI did make one final attempt to help one of the issues the other day.  You <br/>\nmay remember the dating issue/tattling mom? I called her (my friend of 5  years <br/>\nwho began homeschooling this year) and asked that she stop bc she was  getting <br/>\nthe boy in trouble and he was expressing fear of his mom, so much so he  <br/>\nstated he was going to sleep in his closet. Yelling or whatever the mom was  doing <br/>\nto the boy the tattling mom was the catapult and I was trying to  settle <br/>\nthings down. (I say that because I don&#39;t know enough to say either  way)<br/>\n <br/>\nI asked her,a normally kind-hearted religious woman, &quot;so you know  that he is <br/>\ngetting in trouble so much so he&#39;s going to hide in his  closet, your still <br/>\ngoing to call because the word *kill* isn&#39;t allowed in  your home?&quot;  &quot;Yes, <br/>\nabsolutely that word is banned in my home&quot;, she said.  (The boy jokingly said he <br/>\nwas going to kill *my son* to stir up her son because  a girl her son liked <br/>\nshowed up at the movies with my son.) She knew it was  a joke and said so days <br/>\nago but she still called the mom to cause trouble.. <br/>\n <br/>\nNeedless to say, frustrated by her attempts to play blonde and her pushing  <br/>\nher right to cause trouble, I hung up on her. An hour later she called me  to <br/>\ntell me she had called the boys mom (our list owner)and  said &quot;hi, Just  want <br/>\nyour to know they are all alive and safe and (moms name here) wants you to  <br/>\nknow they are all fine! WHAT! I said.<br/>\n <br/>\nI could not believe this woman who has been my friend for 5 years just made  <br/>\nthat call to someone she&#39;s know for less than a year, that I introduced her <br/>\nto,  to make me look bad by making my call to her look bigger than it was. Now I <br/>\n doubt there is an abuse issue but what bad parent is going to admit that <br/>\nwhen  asked? And If he was she very well may have gotten the boy in more trouble  <br/>\nfor telling another kid............ Two days later he doesn&#39;t answer my sons  <br/>\ncalls and has not been online so he is prob banned from speaking to him who  <br/>\nknows?<br/>\n <br/>\nSo that being the final straw I am walking away to breath. Im not sure Id  <br/>\nwant to start my own group especially after this however I do have a  <br/>\nunschooling group online with 40+ that is slow but full of nice people( current  group <br/>\nabove has 10). We did meet up with a mom I met at the convention last  year so <br/>\nwe have begun to move away from the group situation. <br/>\n <br/>\nLaura<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;It can be exhausting and energy draining to be around negativity,  even if<br/>\nyou are not an active participant in it. The internal stress  generated by<br/>\nthe attempt to stay acceptant and positive in the face of deeply  opposing<br/>\nlife philosophies to your own can make you grumpy without realizing  it. It<br/>\ntakes strength to excise the negative people from ones life. I&#39;m not  very<br/>\ngood at doing that myself. Good luck with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Lacking others around me  that <br/>\nallow their children to be who they are and be happy with friends. My son<br/>\nhas a good amount of friends but this one situation (the closest homeschool<br/>\none  to us) has me a bit stressed over the hurt feelings he has endured. The<br/>\nclicks that form between certain parents with religious<br/>\nbeliefs/control/forced thinking. The phone calls,private meets and<br/>\ngatherings to discuss other  families. It&#39;s been a year now and I am just<br/>\nnow seeing what&#39;s been taking place and I don&#39;t like it. That&#39;s what is<br/>\nrubbing off on me or rather rubbing me across the grain...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that I do is avoid having school/teaching conversations or<br/>\n&quot;how to get them to...&quot; conversations with any of the mothers in my local RL<br/>\ngroups. Actually I am fortunate because there is such a wide variety of<br/>\npersonalities and other interests in the groups that conversation rarely<br/>\nflags - nor do I think so highly of myself that I believe anyone would miss<br/>\nmy opinion about any of their schooling or parenting choices. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a very odd thing, a kind of blindness, in gossipers that they somehow<br/>\nbelieve that they will be spared the same treatment that they are dishing<br/>\nout to others. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever how to counteract it? The first thing that would probably be<br/>\nsuggested is to find a different group. The second thing would be create<br/>\nyour own. <br/>\n<br/>\nI belong to two RL groups - one a general *secular inclusive* group. The<br/>\nguidelines for the group are pretty enlightened in expression. However I<br/>\ndon&#39;t see it as being a place for Unschooling support and thinking - that I<br/>\nget mostly online. In the last 4.5 years that the group has been in<br/>\nexistence, and we now have over 70 families I think, there have been very<br/>\nfew blow ups. The key is a mandate for &quot;at least polite toleration&quot; of<br/>\ndifferent belief systems. <br/>\n<br/>\nActually the members are mostly fairly clueless about Unschooling, but this<br/>\ngroup is not a discussion forum, but a way to facilitate park days, play<br/>\ndates and activities. I have some real friends from that group. There has<br/>\nbeen a lot of thought put in to issues like choosing which park to meet at,<br/>\nand how other activities and &quot;field trips&quot; that provide group discounts<br/>\nmight best be organized (not on Park Day please).<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/djjhp/CWHNmain.htm\">http://www.geocities.com/djjhp/CWHNmain.htm</a><br/>\n will take you to the site if you wanted to read the various guidelines of<br/>\nthe group. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other group is a newly formed Unschooling/Child led learners group<br/>\ncreated by an Unschooling mom to generate more congenial support, more<br/>\nfriends for her son, and more regularity of connection. She started simply<br/>\nby creating a Yahoo group, publicizing it on all the Unschooling and other<br/>\nlocal (to us) lists, choosing an appropriate park and a day and continuing<br/>\nto turn up most of the time. Other ways to find members is to put up flyers<br/>\nat libraries and places frequented by people likely open to alternative ways<br/>\nof being like food co-ops, or liberal houses of worship, or arts and crafts<br/>\ncenters or...well I&#39;m sure you get the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/smwla/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/smwla/</a> for the group description and<br/>\nkeywords to help people understand that this is a non-curriculum based<br/>\nhomeschooling play group, with the focus on mindful parenting, not academic<br/>\nissues.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be exhausting and energy draining to be around negativity, even if<br/>\nyou are not an active participant in it.
