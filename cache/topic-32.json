It is difficult beginning this process of figuring out what is the best thing for our children and then coming here, being honest and being totally shot down at every turn. I guess I realize as I get older and have been a parent longer that people are going to disagree with me and that is just the way it is, that&#39;s ok, I just try to disagree with people in a respectful courteous way. I really don&#39;t think that Sunny is a bad parent for trying to be structured in some ways. I think she is an honest person. There are things that I would do from an unschooling perspective and then are things that I feel that I would need to do in a more structured way (I am going to get really attacked for saying that, I know go ahead). There are things that I learned in school that were extremely damaging and negative but my entire experience in school was not traumatic and terrible. I learned some very insightful things in school and had some wonderful teachers along the way. I just don&#39;t think it has to be so black and white, but hey, what do I know?

I don&#39;t want to be a &quot;best unschooler&quot;, I<br/>\nwant to give my child the best education I can, which is *not* going to<br/>\nhappen in a structured school environment.

I might have been assumed, but then<br/>\nagain the welcome I&#39;ve received so far as been full of &quot;well, that not<br/>\nthe right way to do it for your child&quot;, or at least that&#39;s the feeling<br/>\nI&#39;ve been getting.

Alphabetize your shoes.  Do something that doesn&#39;t hinder<br/>\nyour kids, to fulfill your need for structure and organization. <br/>\n <br/>\nYes, I do need to feel organized.  If I ever want to take over his<br/>\nlearning experiences I can try one of these suggestions.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOkay, we will be leaving soon to go to a Spiral Scout meeting - if<br/>\nanyone else has any pearls of wisdom for me fire them at will.

Grady and I<br/>\nare preparing to have another one (not in the oven yet, but close), and<br/>\nwe are including Orin from the beginning so that hopefully he will be<br/>\nprepared for the changes that will come about from two kids in the house<br/>\n(he&#39;s an only child right now).

He did<br/>\ngo a step further and ask how it got into my belly, which was unexpected<br/>\nto say the least.

He would probably benefit greatly from unschooling, but I<br/>\n&gt; need slightly more structure, at least until I&#39;ve finished deprogramming<br/>\n&gt; myself from the years of schooling I went through.  So, for now we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; doing a mix of the two - letting him choose what he wants to learn at<br/>\n&gt; the moment, and me helping him learn with worksheets, field trips,<br/>\n&gt; games, etc.  At least I know by now that anything can be a learning<br/>\n&gt; experience, if you approach it the right way<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sunny, He&#39;s FOUR! Spend the next couple of years deschooling yourSELF, and <br/>\nlet him learn on his own! They don&#39;t even use workbooks and &quot;schooly&quot; things <br/>\nin SCHOOL at that age! By the time he&#39;s legally required to be registered <br/>\nwith the state, you may have deschooled yourself to UNschool. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t &quot;partially unschool&quot;, but you CAN &quot;be on your way&quot; there!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen, other Floridians--- at what age is a child required to be registered in <br/>\nFL? Until then, relax and enjoy his learning!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Linda","from":"&quot;Linda&quot; &lt;silvertree@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"TiM88UFZj0hsznojHOT7gySb8BQbyXNqidYm_0BaryYH5QGljlGln11oUaxo9pnKDSddDFJur6BJP0GufedupTlt-F8","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"new member intro","postDate":"927600309","msgId":32,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zMi4zMi45NTkyNjk3MzlAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":63004,"prevInTime":31,"nextInTime":33,"topicId":32,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone!

We are an unschooling family with a single daughter age 11 1/2 that has always unschooled.<br/>\nWe feel that life is filled with things to learn at every moment and that it is the decisions we make in regard to this challenge that create our experience.  Sometimes we feel a bit in the minority as we have a single child and the world at large usually has more than one.  It is funny to write this because at the moment dd is at The Hulbert Homeschool Camp in Vermont this week.  Our interests include; organic gardening, eco-villages, holistic health, simple living, earth-based spirituality, puppetry, alternative building, contra-dancing, folk festivals/music, world music, drumming, ritual, sacred space, sustainable living, flower essences, herbs, Reiki,  magical gardening, sewing, ornithology, astrology....just what comes to mind at the moment.   My daughter and husband just returned from a trip to China with her martial arts school which was an opportunity of a lifetime.  My dh takes gong fu as well as my dd and I take Tai Chi/Qi Gong.  I am a massage therapist, RN.  My husband and I are Reiki Masters and my dd has taken the 2nd level of Reiki.  My dream at the moment is to create a learning center here at my home.  We live on 3 acres that borders a State Forest...we would like to facilitate holistic connection to the earth as well as holistic health practices.   So, that&#39;s a not so brief into. of our family and I look forward to connecting with others committed to unschooling in their families.<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63462,"nextTopicId":63598}}
