Since I am extremly <br/>\ninterested in castles and the mid-evil ear in general, I decided to <br/>\nsee if I could find a set of them after Sandra explained what they <br/>\nwere.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure enough, I found some on ebay (no big surprise there).  However, <br/>\nmost of the sets are sold by one person and are only by &quot;buy it <br/>\nnow.&quot;  Also, Exin has several Far West sets that have forts and old <br/>\nwest towns.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI bought a set of each (a castle and a fort), told my DH that it was <br/>\nfor our DD but it&#39;s really for me!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90585,"nextTopicId":90303}}
