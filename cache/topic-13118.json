Tabitha usually keeps<br/>\nreading regardless of whether or not her little sisters have trotted off<br/>\nsomewhere mid-story. I always try to catch her when she&#39;s reading to<br/>\nencourage her. She needs boosts of confidence living in her older sister&#39;s<br/>\nshadow. Just last night she complained that it took her so long to read<br/>\nsomething (Harry Potter). I asked if she remembered what she read when she<br/>\nwas finished. She said yes....I explained many kids her age or older are<br/>\nforced to read before they&#39;re ready and they don&#39;t remember anything they<br/>\nread. That impressed her.<br/>\n**************<br/>\n... she could read to the new baby but maybe not get such a sense of<br/>\naccomplishment, eh?    offering to listen to her myself more may be<br/>\nencouraging.  part of her complaints that night though were that she wanted<br/>\nto be able to do it without me.  she wanted to be able to cook without me,<br/>\nas<br/>\nif not reading is just holding her up in life!  she wants to break free,<br/>\nmove<br/>\non!  but also, wants it to happen by magic.  come to think of it, i have a<br/>\ntendency to want things that way too...  :)<br/>\nWell, that would be nice, wouldn&#39;t it? Ha. Sometimes things like reading<br/>\nreally do just &quot;click&quot; but not always. Tabitha is such a little woman. She<br/>\ntakes over the computer to pretend it&#39;s her office, complete with phone,<br/>\nmemo pad, and little sisters for assistants.<br/>\n*****************<br/>\nps yes, i think she would be interested in being epals...  tabitha can email<br/>\nher at my edress, just put &quot;lynde&quot; in the subject line!  i wont tell her,<br/>\nshe<br/>\nwill be delighted!<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;ll tell Tabitha she has a new e-pal. She also likes snail mail so<br/>\nshe can draw pictures. It&#39;s supposed to be a nice day but I&#39;ll try to get<br/>\nher to write to Lynde sometime today.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater...Valerie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"MorelFam@aol.com","from":"MorelFam@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"QsdnT-G81MSXd8Rs5KJZ2XUGHuKFK2zOgBtqPysnoCE26JGxpAy41s9y58_dCNG5niL44q8Sjg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"reading struggles","postDate":"968816177","msgId":13118,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk1Ljc5MTc5Ni4yNmYwNTAzMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13125,"prevInTime":13117,"nextInTime":13119,"topicId":13118,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/11/00 3:14:27 PM, Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2032740256\">In a message dated 9/11/00 3:14:27 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; You<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have a little one for her to read to, would you?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nvalerie--<br/>\nyesss!  but are they patient enough? hmmm.  not the precocious four year old <br/>\nwho tells her to hurry up and often finishes the word she is sounding out (bc <br/>\nhe can hear it coming!)...  and the 2yr old wont sit still for her either :) <br/>\n... she could read to the new baby but maybe not get such a sense of <br/>\naccomplishment, eh?    offering to listen to her myself more may be <br/>\nencouraging.  part of her complaints that night though were that she wanted <br/>\nto be able to do it without me.  she wanted to be able to cook without me, as <br/>\nif not reading is just holding her up in life!  she wants to break free, move <br/>\non!  but also, wants it to happen by magic.  come to think of it, i have a <br/>\ntendency to want things that way too...  :)<br/>\nerin<br/>\n<br/>\nps yes, i think she would be interested in being epals...  tabitha can email <br/>\nher at my edress, just put &quot;lynde&quot; in the subject line!  i wont tell her, she <br/>\nwill be delighted!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13124,"nextTopicId":13117}}
