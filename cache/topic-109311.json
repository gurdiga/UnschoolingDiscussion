They lacked sympathy during <br/>\ntheir childhood and have long forgotten when they experienced<br/>\ndetachment <br/>\nfrom their parents.  A history like this means rejection is expected<br/>\nand <br/>\nsimultaneously frequently goes unrecognized by all involved unless the <br/>\ntruth about what people need is understood.  To have what people need <br/>\nclear in the mind it helps first to experience meeting or having those <br/>\nneeds met.  It&#39;s crappy that society views these needs as neediness<br/>\neven <br/>\nin infants let alone children or really all people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have to tell you, Ren, and this isn&#39;t directed at you or anyone<br/>\n<br/>\nin particular, we know histories like the above aren&#39;t rare.  I often <br/>\nwish(ed) to be closer to my parents at 8 and even at 30 but I knew not <br/>\nto necessarily expect it.  For me and those like me it&#39;s hard to feel <br/>\nsecure.  Somehow people are just supposed to make do with head<br/>\nknowledge <br/>\nwhen they are loved and cared for.  That just seems so sick to me now <br/>\nbut there was a time I felt weak for not being able to be happy with<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur attachment parenting for ds has healed me a great deal.  The good <br/>\nthing is it&#39;s not too late to enjoy family life and learn from mistakes<br/>\n<br/>\none personally didn&#39;t make and those one makes by default until knowing<br/>\n<br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot; now once they<br/>\n&gt; started snoring louder than my husband then, hey, with no regrets I<br/>\n&gt; kicked then the hell out of my bed.
