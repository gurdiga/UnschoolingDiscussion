That is when <br/>\nI went looking for alternatives, and found unschooling. I was petrified about <br/>\ntaking that step, but when it came down to what was best for my son ( and his <br/>\nsisters), then there was no turning back.  I only regret not doing it sooner, <br/>\nbecause he loved learning and was reading and writing at the age of three <br/>\n(completely self lead too). School destroyed that in all of them. It is amazing <br/>\nwhat one year has done. They are all so happy, and have realized their own <br/>\nstrengths and weaknesses.  They learn and do what they love, which has given them <br/>\nthe confidence that they had lost, and the desire to learn more.  In time my <br/>\nfear of bringing them home to learn has been replaced with confidence and <br/>\nexcitement, because we are all free from the confinements of the school system <br/>\nwhich had put so many limits on what they were able to accomplish in their own <br/>\neducation, and who they were as individuals. I love that our family is so healthy <br/>\nnow compared to the chaos of what it was before.  Torturous<br/>\nmornings, and chaotic evenings fighting about grades and homework, not having <br/>\nenough time to just be a family. We were literally falling apart. <br/>\nI also hate the idea of putting labels on our children just because they <br/>\nlearn differently, and am so glad that I was strong enough to lead my children in <br/>\na different direction.<br/>\nI took him off the meds and realized that the reason his &quot;head was spinning&quot; <br/>\nwas due to the stress of having to function in the school setting and the <br/>\npressures that that entailed.  He has grown into a very self assured young man who <br/>\nloves people, and excels at many things.  He never ceases to amaze me with <br/>\nhis creative ideas for making money, and his talent for teaching other children. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy oldest daughter (16) was so destroyed by comments made by an art teacher <br/>\nin her first year of high school, that she stopped drawing all together.  This <br/>\nwas a girl who has been drawing since she could hold a pencil, and is very <br/>\ngifted.  It took me a good six months of trips to many art museums, and <br/>\nreassuring her of her talent, before she picked up her pencil again.  She has since <br/>\nbecome so confident about her art, and very accomplished.  She is also a very <br/>\ngifted writer, which was completely overlooked in her ps language arts classes.  <br/>\nShe is working on compiling her writing into a book.  My youngest just decided <br/>\nshe wanted to write her own book one day, and is on her 5th chapter.  It is <br/>\njust so much fun watching them become the great young people that they are, and <br/>\ngrowing together as a family. <br/>\nI wish you the best in your journey, and hope that you become confident in <br/>\nyour abilities to do what is so healthy for your children.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Elaine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 3/21/2004 12:13:42 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:taurimom@...\">taurimom@...</a> writes:<br/>\nI started homeschooling my son about 2 years ago after having the <br/>\nlocal school accuse me of not being a good parent because I would <br/>\nnot increase the meds he was taking for ADHD.

My whole <br/>\nfamily has loud, opinionated, exuberant, silly personalities. My son <br/>\nused to be the same way! They crushed his spirit! It&#39;s taken two <br/>\nyears to get it back! I joke about how GREAT it is that he argues <br/>\nwith us now! (Ok, not argue-argue but will stand up for himself!) <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we first took my son out of school, my daughter was in <br/>\npreschool because all her friends were going and she BEGGED to go! <br/>\nHAHAHA So, that gave my son and I the chance to re-connect. Although <br/>\nnow, I know I could have done MUCH better!<br/>\n<br/>\nLike many new homeschoolers, I desperately felt the need to school <br/>\nat home. (Which I hated too since it is TOTALLY against my own <br/>\npersonality!) We tried everything! I knew about &quot;unschooling&quot; and <br/>\njoked on our lazy days that was what we were doing that day! DUH!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d realize how wonderful those days were and we&#39;d `unschool&#39; for a <br/>\nmonth! (Yeah whatever `unschooling&#39; for a month means!) Then I&#39;d <br/>\nget scared and we&#39;d go RIGHT back to school at home or unit studies <br/>\n(that KILLED ME!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son, Aryan, is now 11 and my daughter, Adryan, is now 6 and both <br/>\nare home! Still trying to &quot;do it right&quot; I&#39;d attempt to &quot;school&quot; my <br/>\nson so that I could &quot;catch him up&quot; since he is/was still behind in <br/>\npublic school terms. Doing this, I felt that I was almost neglecting <br/>\nmy daughter even though we did tons of FUN stuff together like <br/>\nsnuggling up and reading and playing. (All while I yelled into the <br/>\nother room for my son to get his work done!! Man! I wanna start <br/>\nflaming myself the more I think of it!) But I thought, she&#39;ll have <br/>\nplenty of time to get where she &quot;NEEDS&quot; to be in her education, I <br/>\nneed to work on my son! (DUH, DUH, DUH!!) <br/>\n<br/>\nThe funniest thing happened though any time we&#39;d get together with <br/>\nfamily they would always comment on how smart my daughter was and <br/>\neven more advanced than her same aged cousin. Ahh she&#39;s just a <br/>\nsmart kid! Of course it didn&#39;t dawn on me that while I was so <br/>\nbusy &quot;schooling&quot; my son, my daughter was unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the &quot;Light&quot; finally clicked on for me a few months ago. <br/>\nAfter a nice day of &quot;school-at-home&quot; struggle. My son asked (ok, <br/>\nbegged) if we could be done for the day! &quot;Fine, I&#39;m getting tired of <br/>\nthe fighting too!&quot; He went his way and I went mine. An hour or so <br/>\nlater I was working on our taxes and starting grouching about not <br/>\nhaving a statement that I needed to complete them. My son asked what <br/>\nthe statement was and I explained it to him. He left came back an <br/>\nhour or so later and told me all that he had learned about <br/>\ninvestments and public companies and stocks and all sorts of stuff! <br/>\nHe had researched the encyclopedias, online, all types of places and <br/>\nI wonder if I shouldn&#39;t have him doing my taxes!! HAHAHAHA<br/>\n<br/>\nTHAT WAS IT!!! Why am I abusing myself AND my kids with this school <br/>\nconcept! So we just quit!! I contact the ONE person in my Homeschool <br/>\ngroup that I knew unschooled and begged to pick her brain and help <br/>\nme get over my doubts! It was SO enlightening! <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;m pretty sure that I&#39;ll start doubting again but I think we <br/>\nhave that covered now too! I opened up and discussed my insecurities <br/>\nwith MY CHILDREN of all people! We all crawled up on the fold out <br/>\nbed that had been their &quot;fort&quot; for the past few weeks and I asked <br/>\nthem how they liked our new way of doing things. They LOVE IT!! <br/>\n(DUH!) So I just told them that I would try my best not to, but if I <br/>\nstart to get crazy and doubt myself I need them to help reassure me. <br/>\nIf it means rolling their eyes at me and doing one math worksheet to <br/>\nshut me up, then please help me out. My son just laughed at me and <br/>\nasked if he should go do one then to just hang onto in case I needed <br/>\nit! (Little smarty pants!) HAHAHAHA<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend, Susan is still helping me! One of my main issues is <br/>\ndocumentation so each week I email her what we&#39;ve done, <br/>\nI &quot;translate&quot; it into educationese and she `checks&#39; my work and <br/>\noffers suggestions to help me give up the teacher mode and enjoy my <br/>\nkids learning and enjoying life!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, that&#39;s my long hello and introduction!

I read it <br/>\nreligiously and am learning a lot!<br/>\n<br/>\nOH and before I forget, I want to say &quot;Hi&quot; (if she made it this <br/>\nfar) to Amanda. I read your post and saw that you are in the MOMS <br/>\nClub! I&#39;m an Assistant RC for the MOMS Club! I&#39;m a bit fortunate <br/>\nbecause I&#39;m one of three homeschoolers in my chapter. I started a <br/>\nMom & Kid Book Club in my group. There is no required book to read <br/>\nor anything just a time for us to get together. The kids discuss <br/>\nwhatever book they&#39;d like and the moms discuss whatever book they&#39;d <br/>\nlike. It is a bit hard because of preschool and public school but <br/>\nthe way I see it, while our activities are kid-friendly, the MOMS <br/>\nClub is for ME. My kids are starting to learn and appreciate that <br/>\nwhile I drive them to this place or that and this activity and that <br/>\nactivity for THEM, I still need my time too! And documented that <br/>\nwould be Interpersonal Relationships, Communication and Human <br/>\nNeeds! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, let me stop before you all fall asleep and your chocolate melts!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a cool day!!<br/>\n~Laura</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91272,"nextTopicId":92148}}
