I need \n  to make this clear, as any counsellor-type will know, so that no-one thinks I \n  talk about breastfeeding on&nbsp;LLL&#39;s behalf, yet.&nbsp; But I too groaned \n  when I read this post, not only because of its inflamatorry nature, but \n  because this is exactly the kind of superiority complex which puts some people \n  off breastfeeding.&nbsp; Breastfeeding is natural.&nbsp; Breastmilk is what \n  babies&#39; sytems are designed to deal with.&nbsp; That does not mean that \n  bottlefeeding, &#39;with safety and love&#39; as Bill and Martha Sears&#39; Baby Book \n  says, cannot meet the needs of babies who cannot be breastfed.&nbsp; \n  </font></div>\n  <div>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font size=\"2\">I think Stephanie&#39;s husband would read this message and be \n  more put off.&nbsp; It would be more helpful for him to talk to other fathers \n  who support their partner&#39;s feeding choices.&nbsp; My dh said, when asked how \n  many times dd2 woke in the night, &#39;I don&#39;t know,&#39; I don&#39;t wake up.&#39;&nbsp; A \n  major benefit for the co-sleeping, breastfeeding father!!</font></div>\n  <div>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font size=\"2\">Dogmatics and rants don&#39;t change people&#39;s minds, nor can \n  they change the fact that some people physically can&#39;t breastfeed.&nbsp; \n  There&#39;s enough aggro in the world without adding to it.</font></div>\n  <div>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font size=\"2\">Tracy</font></div>\n  <div>&nbsp;</div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7812,"nextTopicId":7815}}
