Cable TV, <br/>\n health clubs, free education, the works. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I know this is a popular conception of prison life but it leaves out a <br/>\nfew of the harsher realities, two major ones being beatings by other <br/>\nprisoners or sometimes guards and rapes.  Should these also be the <br/>\npunishment?  This is the reality of our justice system.  If any of us think <br/>\nabout any of our own children or ourselves for that matter, being sent to <br/>\nprison, I believe THOSE things are the fears that scare us most.<br/>\n    Also, if a child&#39;s life in prison really is so much better than his home <br/>\nlife, isn&#39;t part of the answer to see what can be done to change the home <br/>\nlife?  I haven&#39;t met a kid yet who would rather be in prison for the cable TV <br/>\nor the &quot;health clubs.&quot; <br/>\n    I believe the U.S. responds too emotionally to these issues and doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to look at what it would take to truly solve the problems.  I guess <br/>\nthat&#39;s why we have such a huge percentage of our people locked up.  <br/>\n    I am just as capable as anyone else of responding with anger and a desire <br/>\nfor revenge when I hear about horrible things done to people.  I don&#39;t know <br/>\nwhat I would really do if someone hurt or killed someone I love.  I know <br/>\nthere is a part of me that would probably want to kill the person myself.  <br/>\nYet our current laws do not allow that as much as we all might feel that way <br/>\nto some extent because we recognize that it would make our society more <br/>\nviolent, not less violent.  In the same way, I believe that many of the <br/>\n&quot;solutions&quot; the U.S. has now also make our society more violent.  <br/>\n    Here is another thing I think about a lot:  people talk so much about how <br/>\nthese kids should be made to take responsibility for what they do wrong.  But <br/>\nthese kids didn&#39;t just land here from outer space.  When is our sick society <br/>\ngoing to take responsibility for creating an environment which produces the <br/>\nkids they&#39;re complaining so much about?   The previous generations, for all <br/>\nof their own problems and injustices, did not have kids who did these kinds <br/>\nof things.  <br/>\n    Some like to believe that it&#39;s because they beat their kids more and <br/>\n&quot;didn&#39;t put up with this nonsense.&quot;  However, I remember my own grandmothers <br/>\nand neither one were harsh at all.  They were very loving, warm people who <br/>\nwere always willing to talk, to enjoy kids, to help others, to extend mercy, <br/>\nto help their kids with prolblems that the kids didn&#39;t know how to solve.<br/>\n    Too many kids today are left in situations which they have no IDEA how to <br/>\nsolve.  Sure, there are some who do well DESPITE their horrible childhoods.  <br/>\nBut don&#39;t we want to create an environment in which the tendency is to do <br/>\nwell rather than have it be the exception?  Whenever I read about things like <br/>\nthe young boys who pushed the younger boy out of the window because he <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t steal for them, the thing comes to my mind is how strange it is that <br/>\njust a few years back when I was living in...wherever....or doing...whatever <br/>\nit was...these kids were just little boys and I wonder what in the world <br/>\nhappened to make them become this way.  If we don&#39;t start figuring out the <br/>\nanswers to that, we won&#39;t ever solve the problem.<br/>\n    <br/>\n      Lucy in Calif.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4637,"nextTopicId":4641}}
