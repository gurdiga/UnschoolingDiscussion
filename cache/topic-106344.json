I mean,<br/>\nhow will they ever learn to stand in line?&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids know how to stand in line in different circumstances.   Trying to get <br/>\ninto an R rated movie if you&#39;re not old enough, act very mature in the line, <br/>\nand not giddy.  Stand next to a friendly-looking family that might be willing <br/>\nto say you&#39;re with them, and be nice to them in case you see they&#39;re carding <br/>\npeople, when you get closer.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut standing in lines in the U.S. (or &quot;on line&quot; as they do in NYC, because <br/>\nEnglish is spoken strangely there) hardly prepares people to queue up in the <br/>\nU.K.   If two people are waiting for a bus, they queue.   If somoene fails to <br/>\nqueue properly, one of the older women there will &quot;snip you,&quot; meaning tell you to <br/>\ndo it and to do it right, and now.   It doesn&#39;t matter that the bus isn&#39;t <br/>\ncoming for fifteen minutes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhere we live, we&#39;re used to milling around but knowing who was there just <br/>\nbefore us, so we defer to those who were there earlier, and then defer to the <br/>\nelderly or the in-a-big-hurry.  Even at checkouts at the grocery store, the line <br/>\nmight look (but not be) kinda nebulous, as those who are waiting keep <br/>\nshopping around the area.   My favorite post office has a &quot;take a number&quot; system, <br/>\nwith places to sit and lots of wall displays to look at while you wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, schoolkids learn that getting in line means shoving and arguing <br/>\nand then getting yelled at, and they learn how to look innocent while pinching <br/>\nor stepping on other kids without it being apparent or proveable that they did. <br/>\n My kids didn&#39;t learn that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was standing in line outside the building waiting for the teacher to come <br/>\nand lead us into the classroom after lunch when I heard that President Kennedy  <br/>\nhad been shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106341,"nextTopicId":106338}}
