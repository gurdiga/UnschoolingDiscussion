(picture me in lotus position :) ).<br/>\n<br/>\nSanity?  No. Not around here.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you are hsing, I think that&#39;s a long way from the sane, normal way to <br/>\ngo. So  . .. <br/>\n<br/>\nMess is good.  Cleaning up is good.  Putting things UP and asking mom to get <br/>\nthem down when needed at least alerts me to a pending project.  Paint and <br/>\nother art supplies are UP in a cabinet, but there is a box of less messy <br/>\nart/craft stuff in a few rooms.  Boxes are good.  Even if stuff is dumped in <br/>\nthe box, it&#39;s up off the middle of the living room floor.  Outside is good!!  <br/>\nWe don&#39;t have pretty outdoor furniture, but when a neighbor is getting rid of <br/>\nsome old table, that can be a project table until the weather destroys it.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s not Martha Stewart but I don&#39;t worry about the furniture that way.  And <br/>\nwe have tile floors -- that&#39;s what hubby does -- so that helps.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14677,"nextTopicId":14628}}
