My sister has been a practical and clinical Pathologist<br/>\nfor years, but she is in the middle of shifting gears and is getting her<br/>\nlicense as a General Praticioner.  Her husband owns a Veterinary Hospital,<br/>\nwhere he is the head Vet.  I hear that they keep a real menagerie at their<br/>\nhouse, although I have never had occasion to visit in recent years,<br/>\nunfortunately.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the reading, I wanted to add a little story here about my nieces.  I<br/>\nhave been lamenting about my lack of support from family and friends in<br/>\nboth the unschooling, and in our pending adoption.  Last night I had a<br/>\nreally great conversation with my brother online.  He apologized for being<br/>\nso crazy/busy lately with his work and said he and his family support us<br/>\n100% in whatever we decide to do.  He was interested and asking questions<br/>\nabout the adoption, but then I started to tell him about Unschooling, and<br/>\nWOW!  He was real interested right from the get-go.  His girls and my boys<br/>\nare very close, in age and as friends, and I would LOVE to Unschool the<br/>\ngirls at my home until they get to a place where one of them can afford to<br/>\nstay home.  I know that my Sister-in-law wants to homeschool real bad.  I<br/>\ntold him he needs to move out here (LOL.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I told him I thought his kids were perfect candidates for<br/>\nUnschooling.  His older daughter is reading whole books now, writes her<br/>\nname, and knows her alphabet backwards and forwards, among many other<br/>\nthings, and she is not yet 4!!  She has also never been to preschool.  I<br/>\ntold him she will be bored to tears in ps.  His younger daughter is trying<br/>\nhard to follow her sisters example (sibling rivalry) and she does NOT<br/>\nsubmit well at all to authority figures.  I fear for her in school, as she<br/>\nis so much like I was.  I told my Kindergarten teacher the first day of<br/>\nschool &quot;You can&#39;t tell me what to do, YOU&#39;RE not my Mother!!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister-in-law has a photographic memory and really loved school, the<br/>\nwhole way around.  She has almost completed her degree to teach highschool,<br/>\nbut she told me her &#39;secret&#39; wish and her chief desire has always been to<br/>\njust stay home and be a mommy, and to homeschool.  When I spoke to her<br/>\nabout it, she was also interested.  She told me about how the girls had<br/>\nbeen asking about the Solar System (at 2 and 3!) as in &quot;Mommy, do we live<br/>\nin outer space?&quot;  and &quot;What is the sun?&quot;  That kind of thing.  So she was<br/>\ngetting books on it for them to read and was making a &quot;Solar System&quot; out of<br/>\nsalt and pepper shakers and other items at breakfast the other day to try<br/>\nto explain to them.  She also said that her three year old was asking about<br/>\nMummies, so she was getting her a kit from Barnes and Nobel with hyroglyph<br/>\nstamps, stickers, books and other cool Egyptian stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny thing is, when I told my brother all about Unschooling and child<br/>\nled learning and how it teaches kids to think for themselves and follow<br/>\ntheir bliss, to make careers out of their passions, he said &quot;Wow, So have<br/>\nyou already started?&quot;  I said &quot;Yes! and so have you!&quot;  He was speechless!<br/>\n(LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\nFeeling better,<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95480,"nextTopicId":95855}}
