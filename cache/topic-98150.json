Mine prefer comedy and music and cartoons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is false peace and real peace.  Contentment in a noisy house is <br/>\ncloser <br/>\nto peace than the sound and appearance of peace when the mom is <br/>\nnegative and <br/>\nthe child is controlled.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra***************<br/>\n<br/>\nLOL... for us it is the opposite.  I prefer the cartoons and funny silly stuff, while Bekka (almost 8) prefers CSI, anything with aliens, etc...  I used to try to tell her &quot;no&quot;  because she would get nightmares (from the alien/monster stuff) but that just seemed to intensify her curiosity and demand.  There was one time (before I came to unschooling) that I finally said &quot;Fine.  I used to tell you &#39;no&#39; because you do get nightmares sometimes, but if you really want to watch it then we will.&quot;  Now that I let her, she watches less of the scary stuff - or at least is quite choosy and discusses it in great detail.  She is still into crime stuff and anything medical - and we talk about it alot.  I think there&#39;s also a part of her that likes to watch mom squirm (I have developed a queasy stomach in the past few years!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
