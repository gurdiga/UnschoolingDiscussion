So now they&#39;re starting to think of <br/>\npre-school.  They know I work in homeschooling and that we&#39;ll be unschooling <br/>\nour children, though they don&#39;t have a clear idea yet of what unschooling <br/>\nmeans.  Anyway, previously whenever homeschooling came up they both always <br/>\nsaid, oh, we could never do that and made positive comments about ps.  <br/>\nYesterday, for the first time, I my SIL said, &quot;I hate school.&quot;  I was amazed. <br/>\n I think as it gets closer to really sending her daughter she&#39;s having more <br/>\nnegative thoughts about it.  We all talked about it for awhile yesterday.  <br/>\nActually, DH did most of the talking.  He&#39;s much more into trying to convince <br/>\nthem than I am.  (I think it would be great for them to unschool but I think <br/>\nthey need to feel ready, not be pushed.)  Anyway, most of their arguments <br/>\nwere pretty feeble, things like, &quot;How would she learn a foreign language?&quot;  <br/>\nEventually, it came down to what I think is the real reason for my SIL - she <br/>\nfeels like she would be giving up her life and she doesn&#39;t want to do that.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s tired of being home with her daughter a lot and wants time where she <br/>\nisn&#39;t there.  Much to my surprise, my BIL suggested that they could share - <br/>\nhe being there two days and she the other two and both for three.  I was <br/>\namazed.  But she didn&#39;t really respond to that suggestion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point they plan to put her into ps and &quot;see what happens.&quot;  They&#39;re <br/>\npretty protective, so I wonder how it will fall out.
