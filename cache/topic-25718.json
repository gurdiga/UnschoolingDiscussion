I wonder if your daughter might like to be part of <br/>\nan online critique group.  I&#39;m not sure where she might find one, but <br/>\njoining a list for people who write things similar to what she likes to <br/>\nwrite or wants to write might be a place to find one.  I joined one that <br/>\nwas an offshoot of the children&#39;s writing list I&#39;m on.  When that one <br/>\ndidn&#39;t work out for me, I just put out a call on the list for people <br/>\nwanting a group.  It&#39;s working well.  We send work to the list when we want <br/>\nit critiqued and the rest send it back to the list with their <br/>\ncomments.  It&#39;s quite informal, and members can contribute as much as they <br/>\nwant as long as they critique as much or more as they send in for <br/>\ncritiqueing.  The only real rule is that we try to be kind about what we <br/>\nsay, honest but kind.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe there are teens whose parents are on this list or hs-ca or another <br/>\nlist who would be interested in such a group.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nTia Leschke   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island<br/>\n********************************************************************************************<br/>\nIt is the answers which separate us, the questions which unite us. - Janice <br/>\nLevy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Rachel Wolfe Ravenhart","from":"Rachel Wolfe Ravenhart &lt;ravenhart@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"fxbyWJ94vUZFBzgRuakxHIevpNBQzHDzSqCfMlMywWvEOb8jzXW4FWUQX57R0mzRqpt4hQx9LCNyCKki5OKIFlz-S00hp1OG9byPElwao9exmg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] writing and composition","postDate":"1000576932","msgId":25734,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNCQTM5N0E0LjUxNTVBOEFEQGhvbWUuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDNiYTM2ODUzLjExYjcuMEB0ZWx1cy5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":25718,"nextInTopic":25767,"prevInTime":25733,"nextInTime":25735,"topicId":25718,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Would she enjoy writing fanfic?
