As far as the bread goes, I<br/>\nuse a bread machine now.  My father says that I must be the only person<br/>\nin the world who actually uses their bread machine everyday, I&#39;m not so<br/>\nsure about that, but it sure has saved me a lot of time.<br/>\nNow, as for watching other people&#39;s children.  I did that for a year,<br/>\nfor a very good friend of mine.  Our kids were close in age, I thought<br/>\nthat would help.  They were going to school, so we really only had them<br/>\nin the afternoon and on their days off.  But it was hard.  Most of our<br/>\ndays were cut in half because my kids and I would have to sit outside<br/>\ntheir school waiting for them at 1:30 everyday.  No longer could we go<br/>\nto the beach for the day, or take off for the children&#39;s museum (we are<br/>\nkind of culturally isolated here and need to travel for an hour for a<br/>\nmuseum or the like).  Besides that, since we unschooled and they didn&#39;t,<br/>\nthey would spend their afternoons doing homework (actually with me<br/>\nreminding them that their mom wanted their homework done, while they<br/>\nstruggled with sitting there and not playing).<br/>\nWe don&#39;t watch them anymore, we still play with them a lot, but we were<br/>\nstarting not to like each other anymore.  So the best decision for us<br/>\nwas to say no, sorry.  I felt guilty for a while, I watched their mom<br/>\nstruggle with what to do with them, watched her dole out a lot of money<br/>\nfor a private school that would keep them extra hours.  It was hard and<br/>\nI felt bad.  But we remained friends and I&#39;m not sure we would have if I<br/>\nhad kept watching her kids.<br/>\nAnd for the icing on the cake, they are now being homeschooled.<br/>\nKate</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9440128,"authorName":"ElissaJC@concentric.net","from":"&lt;ElissaJC@...&gt;","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Babies, unschooling and the rest of the family.","postDate":"1029076756","msgId":40690,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyYjIwMWMyNDE0NCRkZjVlYWFhMCQzMzJhMDM0MEBFbGlzc2FKQz4="},"prevInTopic":40689,"nextInTopic":40693,"prevInTime":40689,"nextInTime":40691,"topicId":40646,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have two nephews and a niece that have issues .

His daughter is <br/>\n16 months, doesn&#39;t walk, talk and is obviously still in diapers. (she is <br/>\nslightly developmentally delayed) His son is 5 months. I have wavered back <br/>\nand forth. (His wife met him at the door one day last week, handed the baby <br/>\nto him, said &quot;I need a break,&quot; and he hasn&#39;t seen her since.) I used to watch <br/>\nmy bestfriend&#39;s two children, her daughter is just 3 months younger than Jack <br/>\nand her little boy is 22 months younger than her daughter. At one time I had <br/>\nmy two nursing, her two drinking the warmed up breast milk she stored in my <br/>\nfreezer, three in diapers and one in the process of potty training. I never <br/>\nthought twice about loading them all up, going to the store or the park, or <br/>\ncarting them all around the library. It never occurred to me that life could <br/>\nbe any different with two toddlers or four. Not taking a shower until lunch <br/>\nwas over and everyone was asleep was standard for me. Board books, water <br/>\nmats, finger paints, play-dough in the carpet, upchuck in my hair, I was <br/>\nqueen of my domain! I still had time to make a hearty soup and fresh bread <br/>\nfor all of us to enjoy at the end of the day, and my toilets sparkled. Why <br/>\nnow does the prospect of two more babies scare me? Now I can&#39;t imagine <br/>\nincluding two little ones in all the activities my two are involved in. My <br/>\nbestfriends kids are my kids, mine are hers. And although she and I don&#39;t see <br/>\neye to eye on the unschooling, we still support everything each other does. I <br/>\ncan&#39;t see myself taking my two and two babies to see her daughter dance, or <br/>\nMoly act, or Jack to the skateboard park. Am I being selfish? I don&#39;t see <br/>\nmyself devoting large amounts of time to two new children and still giving <br/>\nall the time I give now to my own kids. I feel like something would have to <br/>\ngive.
