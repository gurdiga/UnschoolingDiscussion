That was sad <br/>\n  because it had potential, but for one thing, the website listed the wrong <br/>\n  hotel (the one from the year before).  I don&#39;t actually know whether anyone <br/>\n  went to the wrong hotel or not.  There were a dozen other problems with <br/>\n  scheduling and physical plant and conflicts, but biggest was the hurricane <br/>\n  which did miss Houston, but did some trashing of Louisiana.  Very near.<br/>\n<br/>\n  To anyone with websites (including me; I need to go do another pass), <br/>\n  especially TIMELY websites, go in there ever few days and click every <br/>\n  possible link to make sure they not only work but they&#39;re not pointing to <br/>\n  last year&#39;s hotel.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One thing Texas has is lots of group camping sites, owned by clubs like Li<br/>\n  ons, Kiwanis, etc.  &quot;Camps,&quot; often with a building (kitchen, bathrooms, big <br/>\n  area) and lots of little shelters and picnic places.  That could be a <br/>\n  conference site.  Reasons AGAINST:  vendors.  Vendors want modern <br/>\n  convenience, 6&#39; conference tables, carpet, etc.   Reasons FOR:  cheap, kids <br/>\n  can play.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  The advantage of a hotel is hotels provide lockable rooms for storage of Much <br/>\n  Paper, they have overhead projectors, PA systems, lots of chairs, food, tons <br/>\n  of toilet paper, many beds.  Shuttles to airports.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then there&#39;s the middle kind of conference.   At a church or similar <br/>\n  building, Friday night and all day Saturday.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve spoken at all three kinds (not camping, on the camp, just an all day <br/>\n  picnic situation).  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Something I like which is none of the above is people just having a speaker <br/>\n  in for one day or evening.  People can pay $8 or $12 apiece and it can cover <br/>\n  the fee and transportation of the speaker.  No huge risk.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But the benefits of a full-blown, sleep and wake up and still be there <br/>\n  conference are the same kinds of benefits as fundamentalist revivals, where <br/>\n  people preach and sing for three days or a week.  You all get caught up in <br/>\n  the fervor of everyone else&#39;s upliftedness and it does something biochemical <br/>\n  to people which can last months (or if you&#39;re lucky, a year).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

That was sad <br/>\nbecause it had potential, but for one thing, the website listed the wrong <br/>\nhotel (the one from the year before).  I don&#39;t actually know whether anyone <br/>\nwent to the wrong hotel or not.  There were a dozen other problems with <br/>\nscheduling and physical plant and conflicts, but biggest was the hurricane <br/>\nwhich did miss Houston, but did some trashing of Louisiana.  Very near.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo anyone with websites (including me; I need to go do another pass), <br/>\nespecially TIMELY websites, go in there ever few days and click every <br/>\npossible link to make sure they not only work but they&#39;re not pointing to <br/>\nlast year&#39;s hotel.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing Texas has is lots of group camping sites, owned by clubs like Li<br/>\nons, Kiwanis, etc.  &quot;Camps,&quot; often with a building (kitchen, bathrooms, big <br/>\narea) and lots of little shelters and picnic places.  That could be a <br/>\nconference site.  Reasons AGAINST:  vendors.  Vendors want modern <br/>\nconvenience, 6&#39; conference tables, carpet, etc.   Reasons FOR:  cheap, kids <br/>\ncan play.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantage of a hotel is hotels provide lockable rooms for storage of Much <br/>\nPaper, they have overhead projectors, PA systems, lots of chairs, food, tons <br/>\nof toilet paper, many beds.  Shuttles to airports.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s the middle kind of conference.   At a church or similar <br/>\nbuilding, Friday night and all day Saturday.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve spoken at all three kinds (not camping, on the camp, just an all day <br/>\npicnic situation).  <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething I like which is none of the above is people just having a speaker <br/>\nin for one day or evening.  People can pay $8 or $12 apiece and it can cover <br/>\nthe fee and transportation of the speaker.  No huge risk.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the benefits of a full-blown, sleep and wake up and still be there <br/>\nconference are the same kinds of benefits as fundamentalist revivals, where <br/>\npeople preach and sing for three days or a week.  You all get caught up in <br/>\nthe fervor of everyone else&#39;s upliftedness and it does something biochemical <br/>\nto people which can last months (or if you&#39;re lucky, a year).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] NE conference","postDate":"1051402793","msgId":65976,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyYi4yODk2OWJkZi4yYmRjN2MyOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65971,"nextInTopic":65984,"prevInTime":65975,"nextInTime":65977,"topicId":65939,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/26/03 5:57:46 PM, kbcdlovejo@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-377213613\">In a message dated 4/26/03 5:57:46 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; SOS made $300 last year (which went to pay the web designer, who <br/>\ndonated her time & services)---but ONLY because Sandra was hurt and the hotel <br/>\ndidn&#39;t charge us for everything.
