My children have a very healthy <br/>\nfear of Western medicine ~ they saw firsthand the effects of *cancer <br/>\ntreatment* on their daddy (cancer didn&#39;t make him sick, but that chemo sure did!!)  At <br/>\n4 & 2 they were perfect skeptics &lt;bg&gt; But this journey began looooong before <br/>\ndaddy&#39;s illness ~ I trusted *my* body to do it&#39;s job to grow and birthe these <br/>\nbabies, I trusted them to nurse whenever they needed, to sleep whenever they <br/>\nneeded, to heal whatever bug infiltrated their system.  I trusted my children to <br/>\nbe whole, complete and perfect at birth: their genitals are intact and I <br/>\nwaived the state/federal mandated *treatments* (e.g. eye goo, vit K, vaccinations) <br/>\nfor them.  <br/>\nMy best example of this faith in action: Hayden was about 3 and his penis got <br/>\nslammed by the falling toilet seat.  He calmly came out of the bathroom and <br/>\nasked for a Band-Aid, without even looking, I found one for him and asked where <br/>\nhe wanted it ~ imagine my shock when I saw the *purple grape* where his <br/>\nperfect lil penis had been, just moments before.  I completely freaked out, and he <br/>\nshut down, not giving me any information.  I put the Band-Aid on the *wound* <br/>\nand let him be (so I could calm the %$#*&^* down and gain perspective).  After <br/>\ncalling my trusted Aunt Donna, I remembered how resilient our bodies are and I <br/>\nknew worst case scenarios for my two choices ~ at the hospital: the horror on <br/>\nthe faces of strangers while looking at his penis, the circumstraint (aka the <br/>\nVelcro crucifix), the medications to *calm the patient*, the forcible <br/>\nretraction of his adhered foreskin and probable/likely circumcision, tetanus shot ~ <br/>\nat home: penile dysfunction, urinary issues, infection ... a HUGE leap of <br/>\nfaith, I watched his function closely, he could still pee without pain, though the <br/>\nsight was still shocking, I could accept his body healing itself.  And it did! <br/>\n I am so glad I didn&#39;t have to put my baby thru any unnecessary trauma in the <br/>\nname of *the right thing to do* (seeing mommy meltdown was enough!).  We <br/>\ndiscuss regularly what constitutes a necessary visit to the doctor and what we can <br/>\ncare for ourselves (with meds or without).  When a trauma occurs, like the <br/>\none above, I&#39;m honest and open about being able to heal ourselves and the <br/>\nnecessity of seeing a professional (NOT necessarily an MD).<br/>\nSo no, I don&#39;t see forcing our kids to do things arbitrarily an effective <br/>\nparenting practice.  We do grocery shopping because it&#39;s necessary, but we do it <br/>\ntogether because it&#39;s fun.  We go to fellowship almost every Sunday, not <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s *required* but because it&#39;s fun (if majority wants to stay home, we <br/>\nall stay home).  Not to say I don&#39;t fall back on the *familiar* ways of <br/>\nparenting, I get crabby and tired too, but in the forefront of my mind is my child&#39;s <br/>\nperspective and the lessons they are learning from my behaviors and my <br/>\nparenting choices.  Unschooling LIFE is my current project.  The leftover shadows of <br/>\nauthoritarian parenting are diminishing and my children are flourishing (so am <br/>\nI!!).

The research was supported by the <br/>\nNational Cancer Institute.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We want pediatricians to talk with parents of adolescents about how <br/>\nmovies can influence their young teenagers,&quot; says James Sargent, a <br/>\npediatrician with the Norris Cotton Cancer Center and an associate <br/>\nprofessor at Dartmouth Medical School.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Parents need to know that if they can reduce their child&#39;s exposure to <br/>\nsmoking in movies, it may have a profound impact on reducing their <br/>\nchances of starting to smoke and drink.&quot; Sargent&#39;s team studies <br/>\nadolescent behavior and how it&#39;s linked to exposure to movies. They <br/>\nhave published numerous papers and articles, which this most current <br/>\nstudy cites. According to this body of research, adolescents see <br/>\nthousands of depictions of smoking by movie stars, and these images <br/>\ninfluence their attitude and behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, Sargent and his colleagues urge pediatricians to use the published <br/>\ndata (see &quot;Related Findings&quot; below) to offer specific advice to parents <br/>\non how to limit access to movies, such as reducing subscriptions to <br/>\nmovie channels, limiting videos to one per week, and restricting access <br/>\nto R-rated movies. They conclude that, &quot;Such parenting measures could <br/>\nreduce rates of adolescent smoking without directly addressing the <br/>\nbehavior.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":111895885,"authorName":"OomYaaqub@aol.com","from":"OomYaaqub@...","profile":"oomyaaqub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Fw: A Drug Problem","postDate":"1058650202","msgId":76761,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJiLjMzOTMzYjhmLjJjNGIxMjVhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76759,"nextInTopic":76763,"prevInTime":76760,"nextInTime":76762,"topicId":76728,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 07/19/2003 5:11:56 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

It is obviously far more complex than what religion one&#39;s parents may have had or not had.<br/>\n<br/>\nA parent can make all choices for their children because of a belief that children are not capable of making good choices.  Or a parent can believe that children are capable of making good choices and the parent can do their best to help their children be informed, to trust the child to make decisions and to be there as a safety net for their children, when necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have done many things to help my children understand the danger of cars and how to safely cross streets since the day they could toddle on their own.  Now they are 7 & 10 and I still make it a point to help them remember traffic safety and to model it myself.  They have no reason to defiantly run into the street, and it wouldn&#39;t make sense to punish them if they did.  What message does that give a small child?  If you run into the street (danger) I, the person who loves you, will hit you (danger).  Do you want your child to do what you ask because they fear your response if they don&#39;t?  Do you want your child to later do what his teen friends ask him to do, because he has learned to do what others want for him, rather than what he wants for himself?  Or do you want him to grow up knowing that his parents trust him and will be his partner, rather than his controller?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome adults do not take their children to the doctor for regular check-ups.  That doesn&#39;t equal neglect if the parent is making an informed choice and doing what they can for their family to promote wellness.  Many parents do not force their children to get shots because the parent has made an informed choice that the child is better off without the shots.  A child raised without vaccines can certainly choose to get them when they are older, if they wish.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":70316959,"authorName":"AimeeL73@cs.com","from":"AimeeL73@...","profile":"aimeels73","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Fw: A Drug Problem","postDate":"1058646886","msgId":76752,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExNy4yNjk3N2Y3MS4yYzRiMDU2NkBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76750,"nextInTopic":76753,"prevInTime":76751,"nextInTime":76753,"topicId":76728,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And <br/>\nobviously we all agree that kids shouldn&#39;t be forced to go to school if parents <br/>\nare in a position to keep them home.  But saying kids should never be forced <br/>\nto do ANYTHING they don&#39;t want to do is simply unrealistic.  If you took that <br/>\nphilosophy seriously enough, you would end up having your children removed, <br/>\nsince you would never even take them to the doctor&#39;s office.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was raised by atheists who never forced me to do anything, since they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t give a damn about me.
