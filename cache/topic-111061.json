Usually the<br/>\nstuff is sprayed in a semi-liquid form over the superstructure made of<br/>\nlumber or steel framing for special purposes (or large chunks of the<br/>\nStyrofoam for major depth). It generally sticks by itself by virtue of being<br/>\nsprayed on. The surfaces are then fine sculpted if necessary, usually using<br/>\na heated wire device for a smooth surface, before a sealer coat and then the<br/>\nscenic art begins. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interior decorating technique used a *lot* in cinema and related<br/>\nindustries is vacuum forming of molded shapes in plastic - including what<br/>\nyou would take to be plaster or wood architectural details - again followed<br/>\nby scenic artistry. Anyone can contract a prop manufacturer or one of the<br/>\nStudio set construction departments to make them quantities of architectural<br/>\nfixtures in vacuum form, provided they are willing to pay, of course. More<br/>\ncompanies are offering dense plastic/soft foam items like molding or<br/>\npaneling for purchase, that is nonetheless flexible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe exterior stuff at Disney is more likely to be a concrete concoction,<br/>\nsimilar to what is used by prop/scenic manufacturing companies. They use<br/>\nenormous moulds with tinted concrete for these large creations. Designing<br/>\nthe molds is a whole job in itself, part of the Set Design position - which<br/>\nin movie credits refers to a draftsperson who creates working drawings,<br/>\nplans and elevations of elements to be constructed, including an awareness<br/>\nof the engineering needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a material, formerly called Sculpt-on-coat but it seems to have<br/>\nchanged its name, that is a gel like plastic molding material that air dries<br/>\nhard enough to drill or saw. There is also a liquid that you dip fabric into<br/>\nthat upon drying becomes rock hard, sometimes enough to support a person<br/>\ndepending on the shape.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, one of the main uses of hot glue in the industry, is for the<br/>\nmanufacture of cobwebs. There is a machine that heats the sticks and then<br/>\nshoots out (with hot air) the liquefied hot glue to create great swathes of<br/>\nhanging web, on to which dust (usually fuller&#39;s earth) will then be blown if<br/>\nthe desired effect is of old webs. The glue gives them that stretchy yet<br/>\nsticky effect when people go pushing through them. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Any  ideas? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nYou could use sheetrock mud.  You probably still have some of it  sitting <br/>\naround.  But I&#39;d buy the dry stuff so I could mix it a little  stiffer than it <br/>\ncomes in the bucket.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s probably what I would use.  If you don&#39;t like a particular  piece, you <br/>\ncan still scrape it off before you paint it.  If you&#39;re doing it  on the <br/>\nwall, don&#39;t make anything too thick, because it may start to droop.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd wear gloves, because that stuff is not good for your skin.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;d probably also use a variety of things...sculpy, clay, paper mache  (white <br/>\nglue and newspaper--what could be cheaper?).  I&#39;d probably make some  things <br/>\non the table and glue them up later, too.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSounds like fun!  Wish I had a space to do that in.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7527178,"authorName":"CelticFrau@aol.com","from":"CelticFrau@...","profile":"celticfrau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"sculpting supplies","postDate":"1136782915","msgId":111061,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI5OS4zODI3NmU5LjMwZjM0ODQzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":111062,"prevInTime":111060,"nextInTime":111062,"topicId":111061,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"HI all - We built our house a few years back.

We have a lot of not so good  drywall <br/>\nseams (just where it wasn&#39;t sanded down enough) places where stuff  didnt&#39; <br/>\nmatch up perfectly, ripples, etc.  We also have a lot of trim that  never got put <br/>\nup.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe went to Disneyworld over the holidays, and I got so inspired by stuff  <br/>\nlike the &quot;tree of life&quot; in the animal kingdom, and just all the sculpture and  <br/>\nart incorporated into all the buildings...even little things like dining huts  <br/>\nhad the coolest designs.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyhow, a couple of the kids and I were thinking how cool it would be to  <br/>\nfill in a lot of our gaps and mistakes around the house with stuff like sculpted  <br/>\ntrees, snakes, waves, plants,...anything really.  But we&#39;re not sure what  <br/>\ntype of stuff we&#39;d use to do that.  What could we get in a huge amount that  <br/>\ncould be molded, sculpted, squished into cracks and corners, and stick to the  <br/>\nwalls?  Any ideas?  I know all that stuff at Disneyworld wasn&#39;t carved  out of <br/>\nwood.  Does anyone know a type of clay or something like it would  work?  Has <br/>\nanyone done stuff like this at their home?  We&#39;ve done  murals before, but not <br/>\n3 dimensional. <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks -<br/>\n <br/>\nNancy B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111090,"nextTopicId":111055}}
