I do believe it&#39;s better for my <br/>\ndaughter to be here with me than as an intact family, or of course I <br/>\nwould move back down there.  But it is sad that she doesn&#39;t know her <br/>\nDad very well, and I know she is missing out on some things by not <br/>\nbeing around that side of her extended family.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s only because I am willing to be supported by the state and <br/>\nbecause my parents are awesome that I am able to do this.  That&#39;s <br/>\njust my view from singlehood.<br/>\nWhy I&#39;m interested in this thread is that I have some good friends (a <br/>\nmarried couple) who are &quot;partially unschooling.&quot;  They don&#39;t quite <br/>\nagree on it and they are only unschooling in certain areas.  I feel <br/>\nlike this is much harder on their daughter than how they were <br/>\nparenting before, except that she does enjoy going home more now that <br/>\nshe can watch tv and have &quot;treats.&quot;  I guess there is not a lot I can <br/>\ndo, I have recommended this list, reading John Holt, and Sandra&#39;s <br/>\nwebsite.  I guess I don&#39;t really have a question but I am awfully <br/>\nfrustrated.  <br/>\nMaybe I just want to say if you&#39;re single, you can unschool.  But if <br/>\nyou&#39;re married and can work it out, that&#39;s better.  I would have been <br/>\nso crushed if my parents had ever divorced.  And if my daughter&#39;s <br/>\nfather had wanted to continue our relationship, I would have never <br/>\nleft.

My daughters father came <br/>\nback into our lives about a year ago.  He and I are together and <br/>\nplanning to live together and evntually get married and he is 100% <br/>\nagainst homeschooling.  I have only recently begun to expose him to <br/>\nthe idea of unschooling.  He thinks I am completely wrong to put my <br/>\nrelationship with her above her &quot;behaving herself&quot;.  Part of the <br/>\nissue is also that I am willing to give him a vote, espeially on <br/>\nthis issue.  Even though he is her biological dad I have raised her <br/>\nalone for 14 years.  We both love her and want her to be happy, <br/>\nhealthy and independnet but we have completely different ideas about <br/>\nhow that is going to happen.  It is the same with many issues with <br/>\nus but our daughter is the only thing important enough for us to <br/>\nargue about.  Everything else we happily agree to disagree.  He has <br/>\nagreed to not say a word for a year but then I am worried about what <br/>\nwill happen next.  He wants to be satisfied that she is progressing <br/>\nwell enough to have an independent life.  She is 14 and is just <br/>\nstarting to transition from de schooling to wanting to do more but <br/>\nnot sure how to go about it.  She is discontented and more than a <br/>\nlittle whiny as she tries to find her place in the world.  I feel <br/>\nfrustrated trying to be supportive of her and having to defend her <br/>\nto her father.  My biggest fear is his forcing her back into school <br/>\nand her choosing to leave home at 16 to get away from him.  I shared <br/>\nthis fear with him and he promised he would not force her to go <br/>\nback.  I have faith in her and I know unschooling is right for her <br/>\nbut I do worry and I am afraid.  I know he has so much to offer her <br/>\nif he could embrace the idea.  He works nights and could do stuff <br/>\nwith her during the day while I&#39;m at work.  He could teach her how <br/>\nto build and fix things and all kinds of stuff about nature.  I find <br/>\nit funny that he left high school and got a GED and makes half again <br/>\nas much money as I do but he is scared for her.  He&#39;s very &quot;down <br/>\nwith the man&quot; but his daughter should go with the crowd and be in <br/>\nschool.  He&#39;s never been to college but he feels she won&#39;t be able <br/>\nto be successful there if she can&#39;t cope with high school.  We are <br/>\nall working so hard on developing a family.  He has agreed to family <br/>\ncounseling and family night once a week.  I&#39;ve agreed to not keep <br/>\nthings from him and to try and not be so defensive.  Liz has agreed <br/>\nto try and be around him more.  Sorry this ended up so long and  <br/>\ndisjointed.  This is something that has been weighing heavily on me <br/>\nfor months.

It has one educational expert giving that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-944586226\">What I find interesting about it, is that it doesn&#39;t have the <br/>\nunschooling article formula that we see all the time.  It has one <br/>\neducational expert giving that old argument about how it might work <br/>\nfor some kids, if the parents and/or kids are interested in learning, <br/>\nbut that for kids that aren&#39;t, it&#39;s not going to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nLame argument, and it was countered in the article by quoting John <br/>\nHolt.  That part was cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther parts of the article didn&#39;t seem very unschooly, like the whole <br/>\nchores thing, and how subject matter was discussed and dissected, but <br/>\nthat could be the writer&#39;s interpretation of what was actually said.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did like this list:<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie Moyer offers the following list to help determine if <br/>\nunschooling is right for your family:<br/>\n Willingness to invest time in your child<br/>\nWillingness to research resources for learning experiences<br/>\nCooperation from partner or spouse<br/>\nAn appreciation of your child&#39;s unique strengths<br/>\nWillingness to develop and explore your own passionate interests (be <br/>\na role model of learning)<br/>\nWillingness to rely on direct observation for &quot;proof&quot; of learning<br/>\nHave respectful, two-way communication about learning<br/>\nCommitment to put your relationship with your child before any <br/>\neducational matter<br/>\nWillingness to let go of your own expectations about your child&#39;s <br/>\nadult life<br/>\nAbility to let go of  pre-conceived notions about what <br/>\nconstitutes &quot;education&quot;<br/>\nAcceptance of the idea that we don&#39;t have control over what happens <br/>\nin someone else&#39;s brain<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a really good starting point for &quot;getting&quot; unschooling.  That <br/>\nis the aspect of unschooling that I came to know first, then it <br/>\ninfiltrated into the rest of our lives, like chores, eating, <br/>\nbedtimes, and all that other stuff that gets so highly regulated by <br/>\nparents in the lives of kids.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":291006621,"authorName":"g-liberatedlearning","from":"g-liberatedlearning &lt;liberatedlearning@...&gt;","profile":"liberatedlrning","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Article in Tulsa Kids","postDate":"1191421382","msgId":30952,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQzQzUzMURFLTBDN0MtNDYwMy1BMUYzLUVDMDg2NUJDQzg3REBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30955,"prevInTime":30951,"nextInTime":30953,"topicId":30952,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here s a good article in Tulsa Kids featuring Leslie Moyer and Jenny Thompson.
