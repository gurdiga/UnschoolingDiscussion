However, my 10 & 12yo<br/>\nhave never shown any real interest in violent movies (animes is another<br/>\nwhole story)...The wierd part of  our home viewing experience relates to<br/>\nthe film version of Much Ado bout Nothing. <br/>\nBeing a comedy (not much in the way of violence) I was unprepared for<br/>\nthe reaction of my 10yod. We all laughed and giggled at the antics of<br/>\nthe characters...then when the father slaps the daughter....she began to<br/>\nsob. She couldn&#39;t believe a father could ever hit a daughter..I guess we<br/>\nhave to stop and look at each individuals sensitivity for how violence<br/>\ncreates a lasting impression on us. We stopped the movie and had a long<br/>\ndiscussion on values (along with their modern day degressions) and then<br/>\nshe understood the situation but by no means APPROVED of it. We watched<br/>\nthis again last week with the 17yo. 10yo began to explain to her &quot;there<br/>\nis a part in the movie your not gonna like, so I&#39;m gonna tell you...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAleasa in MS</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"&quot;Pam Hartley&quot; &lt;pamhartley@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"6KNmVBkfB4NImJ4mSEWlU7hZe05wiMjtkbFCfm-v0LNhvN8n3f8a2gghBUCH-SfSaaeAh36tQLudpF0j3GE9gwffXQLEGZExDVA1hOdU5zc","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Violent Movies","postDate":"942390935","msgId":4453,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yOTMuNDQ1My45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4457,"prevInTime":4452,"nextInTime":4454,"topicId":4453,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
