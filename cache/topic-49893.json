Has anyone done this and if so how did you get one started?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We started a free state-wide online unschooling support group almost two <br/>\nyears ago. It spun off an inclusive group after being a &quot;subgroup&quot; for a few <br/>\nmonths. (We were where the unschooling-curious would go to ask questions.) <br/>\nEventually the inclusive group changed to a private site and wanted to start <br/>\ncharging for membership. We opted to start our own then.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started with just the two of us---our membership has grown into more than <br/>\nsixty families (I haven&#39;t checked the numbers lately). Most have <br/>\n&quot;preschoolers&quot;, but they&#39;ll hopefully ease into unschooling since they have <br/>\nsupport. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe &quot;advertised&quot; on all the homeschooling groups in the state we could find. <br/>\nWe&#39;re on a few search engines. We put up a few flyers in the health food <br/>\nstores in town. THEN we put on a conference---unschoolers and <br/>\nunschooling-wannabees came out of the woodwork!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;d like to form an accountability association specifically for unschoolers <br/>\n(one of our state requirements); it&#39;s in the works, but not yet a reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boards aren&#39;t terribly active: unschoolers don&#39;t seem to need the same <br/>\noutlets as curriculum users. We don&#39;t need advise on which curriculum is the <br/>\nbest! &lt;G&gt; We don&#39;t organize a whole bunch of &quot;field trips&quot;---we mostly go on <br/>\nour own, or with a family or two. But we have had swim days, a waterpark, a <br/>\nHalloween party, and a conference!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s state-wide (small state---though not as small as Rhode Island, I was <br/>\nreminded! &lt;g&gt;), so getting together regularly as a group is not necessary or <br/>\npossible. Things are handled online or by me and Melinda. In unschooling <br/>\nstyle, there are no rules except that you MUST be unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s nice to know that there are &quot;others like us&quot; in the area. I was truly <br/>\nsurprised at HOW MANY unschoolers there were in Columbia and in the state! <br/>\nAnd I&#39;ve heard that they were JUST as surprised to have found us!<br/>\n<br/>\nPick a free site, yahoo/msn/whatever and sign up as an unschooling group. <br/>\nYou&#39;ll need a message board and a membership list---not much more than we <br/>\nhave here, unless you feel the need for more. We have some links and some <br/>\nquotes and a calendar. SOS is going to a private site shortly, but that&#39;s <br/>\nbecause we&#39;re already paying for the conference site---it will just expand.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuild it, and they will come---in droves!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112038769,"authorName":"Shyrley","from":"&quot;Shyrley&quot; &lt;shyrley.williams@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] starting groups","postDate":"1037460865","msgId":49903,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMTE2MTUzMDE3LkNGRUQzNTUzLm91dDAxOC52ZXJpem9uLm5ldEBtYXJrc2NvbXB1dGVyPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxNmUwMWMyOGQ3ZCQwMzljNTI4MCRiNTRlZGVkOEBzdGEuYWRlbHBoaWEubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":49898,"nextInTopic":49906,"prevInTime":49902,"nextInTime":49904,"topicId":49893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
