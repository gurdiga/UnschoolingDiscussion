","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-794441329\">Just HAVE to share this with you.<br/>\nDiana A.<br/>\n&quot;the world is our classroom&quot;<br/>\nREAD THIS.  LET IT REALLY SINK IN...THEN CHOOSE HOW YOU START<br/>\nYOUR DAY<br/>\nTOMORROW...<br/>\n<br/>\n    Michael is the kind of guy you love to hate. He is always in<br/>\na good<br/>\nmood  and always has something positive to say.<br/>\nWhen someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply,<br/>\n&quot;If I were any better, I would be twins!&quot;<br/>\nHe was a natural motivator.  If an employee was having a bad<br/>\nday,<br/>\nMichael was  there telling the employee how to<br/>\nlook on the positive side of the situation.<br/>\n    Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went<br/>\nup to<br/>\nMichael and asked him, &quot;I don&#39;t get it!  You<br/>\ncan&#39;t be a positive person all of the time.  How do you do it?&quot;<br/>\n     Michael replied, &quot;Each morning I wake up and say to myself,<br/>\nMike<br/>\nyou have two choices today.<br/>\nYou can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose  to be in<br/>\na bad<br/>\nmood.  I choose to be in a good mood.<br/>\nEach time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or<br/>\nI can<br/>\nchoose to learn from it.<br/>\nI choose to learn from it. Every time someone comes to me<br/>\ncomplaining, I<br/>\ncan choose to accept their complaining or I<br/>\ncan point out  the positive side of life.  I choose the positive<br/>\nside<br/>\nof  life.<br/>\n     &quot;Yeah, right,  it&#39;s  not that easy,&quot; I protested.<br/>\n<br/>\n     &quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Michael said. &quot;Life is all  about choices.<br/>\nWhen you<br/>\ncut away all the junk, every situation is a choice.<br/>\nYou choose how you react to situations.  You choose how people<br/>\nwill<br/>\naffect your mood.  You choose<br/>\nto be in a good mood or bad mood. The bottom line: It&#39;s your<br/>\nchoice how<br/>\nyou live life.&quot;<br/>\nI reflected on what Michael said.  Soon thereafter, I left the<br/>\nTower<br/>\nIndustry to start my own business.  We lost<br/>\ntouch, but I often thought about him  when I  made a choice<br/>\nabout life<br/>\ninstead of  reacting to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved in a<br/>\nserious<br/>\naccident, falling  some 60 feet from a communications<br/>\ntower.  After 18 hours of surgery  and  weeks of intensive care,<br/>\nMichael<br/>\nwas released from the hospital with rods placed in his back I<br/>\nsaw<br/>\nMichael about  six months after the accident. When I asked him<br/>\nhow he<br/>\nwas, he replied.<br/>\n    &quot;If I were any better, I&#39;d be twins. Wanna see my scars?&quot;<br/>\nI declined to see his wounds, but did ask him what had gone<br/>\nthrough his<br/>\nmind  as the accident took place.<br/>\n    &quot;The first thing that went through my mind was the<br/>\nwell-being of my<br/>\nsoon  to  be born daughter,&quot; Michael replied.<br/>\n    &quot;Then, as I lay on the ground, I remembered that I had two<br/>\nchoices:<br/>\nI could choose to live or I could choose to die. I chose to<br/>\nlive.&quot;<br/>\n      &quot;Weren&#39;t you  scared?   Did you lose consciousness?&quot; I<br/>\nasked.<br/>\nMichael continued, &quot;...the paramedics were great. They kept<br/>\ntelling me I<br/>\nwas going to be fine.  But when they wheeled me into the ER and<br/>\nI saw<br/>\nthe expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got<br/>\nreally<br/>\nscared. In their eyes, I read  &#39;he&#39;s a dead<br/>\nman.&#39; I  knew I  needed to take action.&quot;<br/>\n     &quot;What did you do?&quot; I asked.<br/>\n    &quot;Well, there was a  big burly nurse shouting questions at<br/>\nme,&quot; said<br/>\nMichael.<br/>\n      &quot;She asked if I was allergic to anything.<br/>\n     &#39;Yes, I replied.&quot;  The doctors  and nurses stopped  working<br/>\nas they<br/>\nwaited for my reply.  I took a deep  breath and<br/>\nyelled, &quot;Gravity.&quot;<br/>\nOver their laughter, I told them, &#39;I am choosing to live.<br/>\nOperate on me<br/>\nas if I am alive, not dead&#39;.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael lived, not just due to the skill of his doctors, but<br/>\nalso<br/>\nbecause of  his amazing attitude.<br/>\nI learned from him that every day we have the choice to live<br/>\nfully.<br/>\nAttitude, after all, is everything.  You have two choices now:<br/>\n     1. Delete this.<br/>\n              or<br/>\n     2. Forward it to the people you care about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you will choose #2.  I did.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2042,"nextTopicId":2046}}
