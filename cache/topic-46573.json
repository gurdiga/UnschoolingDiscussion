That&#39;s what I want for my kids and me, for them to be able to come to me and talk about stuff, and for me to be able to know what&#39;s going on in their lives. By the time I was 16, I&#39;d been involved in so many illegal things, many potentially life-threatening, and my mom to this day does not have a clue about any of it. I don&#39;t know if it would have done me any good if she had, I certainly was not in the habit of listening to her. &lt;g&gt; But I would have at least thought about what she had to say, and possibly acted on some parts of it. Looking back, I realize that I&#39;m lucky to be here and in one piece. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: Mary Bianco <br/>\n<br/>\n  Not sure I can take a stab at this but I&#39;ll try. Hypotheticals can be <br/>\n  tricky. One never really knows what one would do until in that situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n  First of all, my daughter will be 17 in March. She goes to school but of <br/>\n  course is raised now in the same loving surroundings as the other <br/>\n  unschoolers. It wasn&#39;t always that way and because of it, had some problems <br/>\n  to deal with. She&#39;s now at a point in her life, where she is getting <br/>\n  comfortable with who she is and what she has the power to do and respect and <br/>\n  trust from us in regard to those choices. She is making good choices in her <br/>\n  life and at the young age of 16, has for the most part been through all <br/>\n  kinds of crap some people don&#39;t deal with until way later if at all. As sad <br/>\n  as I am about what she has had to go through, I&#39;m glad it&#39;s &quot;out of her <br/>\n  system&quot; so to speak. She is the kind of kid that had to learn for herself. <br/>\n  Someone telling her doesn&#39;t get it, even the bad choices have to be made by <br/>\n  her and she has to suffer for her own consequences. She&#39;ll come right out <br/>\n  and tell you this. She has to learn on her own and as heartbreaking as it <br/>\n  was sometimes to watch, she is a better person for it. Would I be happier if <br/>\n  she would have just taken my advice? Definitely!! But she is in a good place <br/>\n  because of what she went through. I can understand that. I messed up an <br/>\n  awful lot as a teen and way into my adult life. I don&#39;t regret it because I <br/>\n  wouldn&#39;t be who I am today. I was a hard head like her. And sometimes the <br/>\n  apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree! &lt;BG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  My daughter knows how we feel about alcohol, pot, cigarettes and other <br/>\n  drugs. She&#39;s been educated from early on about them all. She started to <br/>\n  smoke (cigarettes) awhile back and we spoke to her about it. I can&#39;t force <br/>\n  her to stop. She says she doesn&#39;t do it anymore and that&#39;s okay with me. I <br/>\n  trust that she&#39;s telling me the truth. We all know that she has and probably <br/>\n    still does smoke a bit of pot from time to time. My husband and I have no <br/>\n  big problem with that. She does know the repercussions of getting caught, <br/>\n  that it&#39;s illegal just like drinking for her would be. We also know she&#39;s <br/>\n  done that too. I can honestly say that since we&#39;ve eased way up on her, this <br/>\n  partying behavior has calmed way down. She looks at her year younger cousin <br/>\n  who does rolls (popping a few piils at once like ex) and sees someone just <br/>\n  down right stupid. That kind of stuff scares her and I believe she&#39;s never <br/>\n  tried it. I can deal with some drinking and smoking as long as she&#39;s <br/>\n  somewhere safe and not driving around with a group doing it in the car.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We&#39;ve been honest with her and she knows it. Telling the kids stuff to scare <br/>\n  them and never thinking they will for the most part want to try something is <br/>\n  silly. It doesn&#39;t work.  I know a few people who have said they never tried <br/>\n  any kind of partying but not many. And the not my kid attitude will get you <br/>\n  nowhere. My daughter is also on birth control. It helps regulate what were <br/>\n  painful periods and she has a boyfriend and they have sex. They use condoms <br/>\n  but we all don&#39;t want to take the chance of a pregnancy too. It&#39;s up front <br/>\n  and simple for us. Be responsible and make wise choices. Of course having <br/>\n  her a virgin would be nice but not practical for her. So we deal with it. <br/>\n  It&#39;s not the end of the world if she&#39;s comfortable talking about it with us <br/>\n  and again making wise choices. I see that she is.<br/>\n<br/>\n  IF she were to get into drugs and I knew and found out it wasn&#39;t a one time <br/>\n  thing, I would step in. Not sure how but I would. I would find her some kind <br/>\n  of counseling or help. I have obviously stepped in before when it was an <br/>\n  issue of safety.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She once had  boyfriend who we forbid her to see. Now normally I would say <br/>\n  that doesn&#39;t work and I was also the one that allowed her to see him again <br/>\n  after once before banishing him from her life. I thought maybe he grew up <br/>\n  and made some changes. I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I was wrong and <br/>\n  my daughter&#39;s life was in jeopardy because of it. She carried on something <br/>\n  fierce. We got her counseling. She continued to talk to him from the school <br/>\n  phone. It finally got the to the point where she started to see from afar <br/>\n  how he was. The young love started to fade and she is very much over him now <br/>\n  and thankful to us for what we did. If it was a matter of me just not liking <br/>\n  him, I would never have made that choice. It was life threatening to her and <br/>\n  I also believe us. So if the drug thing was the same situation, I would <br/>\n  definitely step in.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n  Broadband?
