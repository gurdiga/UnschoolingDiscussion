I am trying so hard to not add emotion to the situation but calmness.  It is difficult sometimes but I can already see changes taking place.

My mother thinks I am nuts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been wanting to send another thank you to everyone for the advice and words of wisdom that has so changed our lives.
