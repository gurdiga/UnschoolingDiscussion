LITTLE kids being &quot;grounded.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a babysitting co-op/playgroup years ago one girl&#39;s family was late and she <br/>\nwas made to sit at a table by herself for part of the time.  Crime?  She <br/>\nhadn&#39;t finished her math.  She was homeschooled.  That was a factor in my <br/>\ndeciding structured school at home was for the not-so-bright.   That meeting <br/>\nwas once a week, it served an important socio-political-logical purpose <br/>\n(which kids were getting along how? what behavior needs to be watched when <br/>\nkids are staying here and there during the week?), AND, the other kids <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have been affected by or witness to this mom&#39;s derision and <br/>\nbelittlement of her daughter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast week Holly had a free day which was usually scheduled, but she couldn&#39;t <br/>\nplay with her friend, because her friend was grounded.  Why?  Homeschooled <br/>\nkid, hadn&#39;t done enough reading.  (And had missed doing some chores.)   So <br/>\nshe couldn&#39;t talk on the phone and couldn&#39;t play with Holly.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, playing with Holly would have been better for her intellectually and <br/>\nemotionally than doing chores and &quot;reading chapters.&quot;  (It&#39;s quite a slide <br/>\nback downhill when kids &quot;read chapters&quot; instead of reading a book or a story!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, Holly&#39;s reaction was to buy the same book and start reading it for <br/>\nfun, to see how hard it would be to keep the pace the other mom had been <br/>\nrequiring.  She&#39;s caught up, only Holly&#39;s doing it for fun and out of <br/>\ncuriosity.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt did seem to me that Holly was punished because someone else had <br/>\nunreasonable expectations and not much awareness of what&#39;s important in life. <br/>\n Looking at the moment instead of looking at the years of growth seems like a <br/>\ndriver looking intently at a crack in the pavement instead of forty feet <br/>\nahead.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the other girl is learning is that reading is a chore and her mother <br/>\ncares more about arbitrarily made-up rules than about the girl&#39;s feelings and <br/>\nfreedom, and what Holly&#39;s learning is how NOT to be when she&#39;s a mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68893,"nextTopicId":68887}}
