He hates reading. what do you suggest on<br/>\n&gt; that.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>..............<br/>\nWhat are your overall goals for &quot;reading?&quot;  Being able to read something and<br/>\nget the information he wants from the material?  He will eventually want to<br/>\nknow something about his current video game and will need to read to figure<br/>\nout how to get past something hard--you&#39;ve heard of &quot;walk-throughs?&quot;   Also,<br/>\nhe may be reading while he plays his video game.  My kids are playing Animal<br/>\nCrossing right now--that requires constant reading.    Is being able to<br/>\ncommunicate in writing one of your goals for him?   Does he email or instant<br/>\nmessage other kids?  If he does, he gets instant feedback on his writing.<br/>\nWe enjoy the yahoo email list unschooling_gamers.  My kids are getting a<br/>\nlittle tired of Runescape, but for a while they played that for hours<br/>\neveryday.  (www.runescape.com --it&#39;s free)  They had to type to be able to<br/>\ncommunicate with the other players on line.  In fact, my kids learned so<br/>\nmuch cool stuff playing that game!!  And I had fun hanging out with them or<br/>\ntalking to them about Runescape.  If we had had another computer, I would<br/>\nhave had my own character!<br/>\n<br/>\nhe wants to make video games later in life and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that requires alot of math. any suggestions.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>.............................<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t have to learn the math that he might need later right now--it can<br/>\nwait.   The school system has convinced people that math must be taught a<br/>\nlittle bit at a time and in a particular order.  That&#39;s rubish--it&#39;s just<br/>\nnot based on good science!   Also, my kids aren&#39;t interested in making their<br/>\nvideo games, but there are resources out there that will help him create his<br/>\nown video games--now, not &quot;when he grows up.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of published authors have said that if you want to be a great writer,<br/>\nthen read a lot.  I think the same logic could be applied here:  If your son<br/>\nwants to make video games, he should experience (&quot;play&quot;) lots of video<br/>\ngames.  And my kids loved flipping through this book:  The Ultimate History<br/>\nof Video Games: From Pong to Pokemon--The Story Behind the Craze That<br/>\nTouched Our Lives and Changed the World by Steven L. Kent  I just found the<br/>\nexact title by going to Amazon.com and searching for &quot;video game history.&quot;<br/>\nBut we checked it out of the library when we read it.  There were several<br/>\nother books that came up from my search--check it out!<br/>\n<br/>\nim really<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; new at this. and i really am going to work on this.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>........................<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides this list, I really enjoy reading the yahoo group, unschooling<br/>\nbasics.   You might want to check that one out, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeirdre in Alabama</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104357,"nextTopicId":104320}}
