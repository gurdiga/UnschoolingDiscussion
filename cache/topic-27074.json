Now, the &quot;War<br/>\nagainst Terrorism&quot; has served to intensify this<br/>\ndynamic. In France, in order &quot;fight terrorism,&quot; the<br/>\ngovernment is weighing a series of exceptional<br/>\nsecurity amendements, part of the &quot;Loi Securite<br/>\nQuotidienne&quot; (&quot;Day-to-day Security Law&quot;) that would<br/>\ninfringe upon constitutional rights. Human Rights<br/>\nactivists are protesting such measures. In Germany,<br/>\npolice officers broke into the homes and office of the<br/>\ngroup &#39;Libertad!, confiscating computers, hard disks,<br/>\nCD-ROMs and documents. &#39;Libertad!&#39; had mobilised in<br/>\nprotest of the deportation of refugees by the airline<br/>\n&#39;Deutsche Lufthansa AG&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the United States, where so much is made of freedom<br/>\nand democracy measures that threaten civil liberties<br/>\nlike former President Clinton&#39;s Executive Order #12919<br/>\nhave been in place, or intended to be put in place for<br/>\nyears. There is a relatively long history of<br/>\nrepression against progressive activists in the United<br/>\nStates and the countries the U.S. influences<br/>\nworldwide, both during peace time and war. Civil<br/>\nlibertarians are strongly protesting creation of the<br/>\nOffice of Homeland Security along with the debates<br/>\nsurrounding the US Anti-Terrorism Act. Some call<br/>\n&quot;Orwellian&quot; the increasingly sweeping proposals that<br/>\nare being put forward. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the present atmosphere of war, many are calling for<br/>\nmeasures that will further restrict civil liberties<br/>\nand human rights. Both on the ground and in cyberspace<br/>\nnational security is being used as an excuse to<br/>\nquestion free speech. U.S. government surveillance<br/>\ntechniques as Carnivore and Echelon as well as<br/>\nencryption crackdowns are finding even more support<br/>\nthan they did before the September 11 attacks, when<br/>\nsurveillance by governments and private corporations<br/>\nwas already on the rise worldwide. Likewise, in real<br/>\nspace workplace surveillance, face recognition<br/>\ntechnology, fingerprint tracking and Social Security<br/>\nnumber schemes are being seriously considered in<br/>\ngovernment and corporate circles. Many who rely on the<br/>\nfreedom to dissent are preparing to protect<br/>\nthemselves, wondering if appeal to government is still<br/>\nviable. Some are taking their fears, inspiration, and<br/>\ncreativity to the streets.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther relevant links:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.xs4all.nl/~felipe/articles/infiltration_lecture.htm&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.zmag.org/hermancover.htm&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://lists.indymedia.org/mailman/public/imc-ontario-stories/2001-August/000016.html&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://argentina.indymedia.org/display.php3?article_id=914&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=61614&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://germany.indymedia.org/2001/08/5935.html&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://italy.indymedia.org&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.lsijolie.net/article.php3?id_article=68&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=75749&group=webcast&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.cdt.org&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.newnetizen.com/fema/eoboc.htm&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.freedomdomain.com/concamps/fema01.html&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/8425/COIN.HTM&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,47051,00.html&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.aclu.org/safeandfree/&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://print.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=930&group=webcast&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.aclu.org/action/usa107.html&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0922-07.htm&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://hamilton.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=494&group=webcast&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://nyc.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=10536&group=webcast&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-201-7149229-0.html&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://seattle.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=6813&group=webcast&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://seattle.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=6762&group=webcast&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://fly.hiwaay.net/~pspoole/echelon.html&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2812463,00.html?chkpt=zdnnp1tp02&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://cryptome.org/no-hiding.htm&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cctv/&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.privacyfoundation.org/workplace/index.asp&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.notbored.org/viisage.html&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nnational ID cards &lt;http://home.earthlink.net/~idzrus/&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.networkusa.org/fingerprint.shtml&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.publiceye.org/liberty/Security_for_Activists.htm&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.publiceye.org/liberty/War_at_Home/Glick_Overview.html&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://slashdot.org/yro/01/09/16/1647231.shtml&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;http://www.notbored.org/lithuania-scp.html&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n******************************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nGOVERNMENT INFORMATION SOURCES=<br/>\n<br/>\nCalifornia Online Services<br/>\n&lt;http://www.ca.gov/state/portal/myca_homepage.jsp&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCIA World Factbook 2001<br/>\nhttp://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/index.html<br/>\n&lt;http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/ind!ex.html&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFed World Information Network Home Page<br/>\n&lt;http://www.fedworld.gov/&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHealth & Human Services News & Public Affairs<br/>\n&lt;http://www.hhs.gov/news/&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Security Archive<br/>\n&lt;http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnited Nations Website<br/>\n&lt;http://www.un.org/&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUSA Census Bureau Homepage<br/>\n&lt;http://www.census.gov/&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUSA House of Representatives<br/>\n&lt;http://www.house.gov/&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUSA ~ HUD Website {Housing & Urban Development}<br/>\n&lt;http://www.hud.gov/&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUSA Senate<br/>\n&lt;http://www.senate.gov/&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nUSA State & Local Gateway<br/>\nhttp://www.st!
