At first glance, a fancy hotel lobby seems<br/>\njust that, but take a closer look and you&#39;ll see a sofa made of gloves.<br/>\nIn a sunny street scene, a building fa√ßade is laden with crackers,<br/>\ncrayons form fence posts, and the tree is shaded by a stalk of broccoli.<br/>\nChildren and adults alike will love poring over each picture, most of<br/>\nwhich contain more than 100 objects cleverly arranged to delight and<br/>\ndeceive. &quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nThey are really well done and lots of fun.

I thought <br/>\nI&#39;d share. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Matt and Luke and I read all the library books they had <br/>\ntaken out.  One of them was a glow in the dark Thomas book that we <br/>\nread in the closet, turning the light on to read the words and then <br/>\nturning the lights off to see the stuff glow.  We ended up playing in <br/>\nthe closet in the dark for awhile then. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the other books we read (also a Thomas book, lol) had pictures <br/>\nof animals on it.  It said &quot;ZOO&quot; at the top of the page, and although <br/>\nthe animals pictured were all animals that could be found in a zoo, <br/>\nnone of the animals were pictured as being in a zoo.  Matt said to <br/>\nme, &quot;Why does that say zoo?&quot;  And I just looked at him for a minute,  <br/>\nbecause he DOESN&#39;T KNOW HOW TO READ!  I hadn&#39;t read that word to him <br/>\nat all, we had just been looking at the animals. I asked him how he <br/>\nknew that said zoo, and he said that in Putt Putt goes to the zoo <br/>\n(computer game), they say, &quot;zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo&quot; over and over again <br/>\nand flash the word on the screen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen when we ran out of books to read, Matt looked for some of our <br/>\nbooks to read from our shelves.  This is cool for me to see, because <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t use to like to be read to much.  We went through most of an <br/>\nI SPY book and then played connect four for awhile.  Then I <br/>\nremembered that I had a Christmas I Spy book that I hadn&#39;t given them <br/>\nat Christmas time (oops!) and got that out.  We did a page of that, <br/>\nand then went to bed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning, Alisha discovered the Christmas I Spy and she started <br/>\nlooking at that, which caused some fighting because Matt had wanted <br/>\nto finish doing it with me today.  I got him interested in finishing <br/>\nthe other I Spy book we had started, and then I thought how cool it <br/>\nwould be to make our own I spy books.  The kids loved the idea, so we <br/>\nset to work on our I Spy creations.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe took some time to clean off the top of the Thomas table, which had <br/>\nbeen really messy.  Then we set up a cool track layout, with the <br/>\nround house, engine wash, train station, water pump, and other <br/>\npieces.  Then we put engines on the track and hid little toys through <br/>\nout it.  We took pictures on our digital camera and are going to head <br/>\noff to Wal-mart in a few minutes to get the picture blown up to 8X10 <br/>\nsize.  Matt&#39;s I Spy says, &quot; I spy 2 marbles, a tire and a yellow <br/>\nscrew.  A black hot rod car and a number 2.  A coin from <br/>\nChuckecheese, scissors, a crayon, a lego,and 2 keys.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlisha arranged stuffed animals on her bed and we hid little stuff, <br/>\nmuch of it stuff from her Barbies or dolls, throughout them.   One of <br/>\nhers says, &quot;I Spy 5 bobby pins, roses, and smokey the bear.  One of <br/>\nSnow White&#39;s Dwarves, a hat, and a chair.  A watering Can, a marker, <br/>\na shovel, a shoe.  7 jacks and scooby doo.  The other says, &quot;I spy a <br/>\nfancy dress and 4 lady bugs, a soccer ball, a pumpkin, and 2 mugs.  A <br/>\nhanger, a bracelet, 2 dominos.  And one of the animals has a bee on <br/>\nhis nose!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n We made French toast for supper, and it was really fun because dh <br/>\nand the boys pitched in without me asking them to.  Dh washed the <br/>\nelectric skillet which I had dirtied this morning and hadn&#39;t washed <br/>\nyet.  The boys set the table together, Luke measured the vanilla and <br/>\ncinnamon for the french toast, and the boys each soaked some bread <br/>\nand put them on the skillet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow we&#39;re headed to Wal-mart (I&#39;m going to make the pictures while <br/>\nRandy helps Alisha find a new basketball, which she needs because she <br/>\njust signed up for basketball and has her first practice on <br/>\nWednesday).  When we get back, Matt wants to make an I Spy on his bed <br/>\nwith his stuffed animals and he also wants to make cookies.  Not sure <br/>\nif we&#39;ll have time to do both of those tonight. Maybe!  But if not, <br/>\nwe&#39;ll have something to look forward to doing first thing in the <br/>\nmorning.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90577,"nextTopicId":90479}}
