How do you get comfortable with letting them do whatever <br/>\nthey want, whenever they want.  Zak at the moment spends hours on the same <br/>\nthing and I worry that he&#39;ll never give up building or playing on the <br/>\ncomputer or doing whatever it is he&#39;s doing.  Is this something that comes <br/>\nover time.  When some of your first started was this something you had to <br/>\ndeal with in yourselves or were you ok with whatever happened.  What if the <br/>\nsomething includes you doing things over and over again?  How involved are <br/>\nyou in what they are doing?  All day, when they ask?<br/>\n<br/>\nFeedback would be great.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10048,"nextTopicId":10154}}
