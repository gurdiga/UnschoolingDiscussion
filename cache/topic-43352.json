But I<br/>\ncan&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever considered him someone I was &quot;like&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see how your second and third sentences (above) address the same<br/>\nissue.  Yes, I think people need to learn to look beyond themselves to see<br/>\nGod&#39;s will.  To me, that seems obvious; one isn&#39;t going to see the will of<br/>\nGod by naval gazing!  My original comment implied (I think!) that<br/>\nself-centeredness is fine in a baby, but that a baby growing into childhood<br/>\nand adulthood needs to grow up seeing other people&#39;s needs, too.  But what<br/>\ndoes letting a baby &quot;cry it out&quot; have to do with seeing (and thereby<br/>\nrespecting) other people&#39;s needs?<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example of respecting someone else&#39;s needs was given on this list<br/>\nrecently.  It involved a child who wanted to do something late at night, and<br/>\na Mom who was too tierd and offered to do the thing the next day.  Small,<br/>\nyes.  But that involves a child learning to respect the Mother&#39;s need for<br/>\nrest.  Given those terms, the parent in question (Joyce, perhaps?) said that<br/>\nher daughter was able to respect that.  Children are naturally good, kind,<br/>\nwhatever.  They only need time and respect themselves to grow.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink that growth is limited to children, btw.  Adults grow, too, as<br/>\nevidenced by the many people here, myself included, whose parenting has<br/>\nevolved by what they read.  I also feel that by learning to parent/unschool<br/>\nbetter and putting more trust in my son, I&#39;m moving closer to what God wants<br/>\nof me, but that&#39;s profoundly affected by what I believe.  Your experience is<br/>\nlikely very different than mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the image of people as innately good yet also experiencing seperation<br/>\nfrom God doesn&#39;t work for you, that&#39;s fine.  It was one that made sense to<br/>\nme when I first heard it and I only wanted to share.
