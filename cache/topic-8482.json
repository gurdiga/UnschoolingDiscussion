It is so maddening and ironic that in a society that <br/>\ngives lip service to tolerance and diversity, there is still the mentality <br/>\nthat there is ONE way to do things and that is whatever the majority are <br/>\ndoing at any given time.  U.S. history is filled with examples of the <br/>\nmajority going in the wrong direction in various issues, but the tendency is <br/>\nto always think that is in the past and NOW we have it right.<br/>\n     It is frightening that the state is willing to act so quickly on the <br/>\nstatements of one person without having to verify that that statement is <br/>\ntrue.  I know there are times that CPS is justified in removing children.  <br/>\nBut it seems that many times personal egos get involved and they don&#39;t want <br/>\nto back down from the position they&#39;ve taken.  <br/>\n     Susan, I&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t go even further for you and I can definitely <br/>\nunderstand why it scared you so much.

the \n  children have been<br>&gt;in<br>&gt;three placements in the past several \n  weeks. I know these children<br>&gt;from the<br>&gt;Berkeley YMCA, where they \n  swim, play basketball, join group arts and<br>&gt;crafts<br>&gt;projects, and \n  generally are a part of the community.

I think back to those many times I<br>&gt;repeated it<br>&gt;over \n  and over as a child his age going to Sunday school.&nbsp; I knew \n  I<br>&gt;would get<br>&gt;a<br>&gt;red&nbsp; bible bookmark with my name and \n  the Lord&#39;s Prayer on it in gold<br>&gt;letters<br>&gt;as soon as I could say \n  the whole thing. I was the same age as my \n  boys<br>&gt;are<br>&gt;now<br>&gt;when I memorized it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;MInutes \n  later my 82 year old Buddhist landlady&nbsp; asked me to come \n  in<br>&gt;and<br>&gt;chant<br>&gt;with her for a few minutes at her alter. She \n  loves my children just<br>&gt;like her<br>&gt;own&nbsp; great grandchildren \n  that Hans and Nils played with daily. She is<br>&gt;broken<br>&gt;hearted by \n  this tragedy. She misses the hugs the boys gave her \n  every<br>&gt;day.<br>&gt;Both<br>&gt;Hans and Nils call her Grannie Annie. She \n  is impatient to get into<br>&gt;court and<br>&gt;give those people her opinion \n  about all of this.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;After a few kind words from Grannie Annie \n  I&nbsp; left to see my children<br>&gt;for<br>&gt;visit<br>&gt;#3. It was \n  wonderful to hug them.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;*****They tell me my sons will be moved \n  to another foster home and<br>&gt;enrolled<br>&gt;in<br>&gt;public school next \n  Monday.*****<br>&gt;<br>&gt;They have no glasses. They have not had needed \n  fillings and teeth<br>&gt;cleaning.<br>&gt;They said they miss me in the \n  morning when they wake up and need a<br>&gt;hug from<br>&gt;me. &#39;They told me \n  they love me and want to come home. We read a book<br>&gt;about<br>&gt;rocks \n  and minerals and learned about the hardness scale: Diamonds \n  10,<br>&gt;Quartz<br>&gt;7, Talc 1. They decided to start a rock collection. \n  We joked and<br>&gt;laughed. We<br>&gt;all three managed somehow not to \n  cry.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;All ages, sizes, and shapes of people who worship in many \n  ways are<br>&gt;sending<br>&gt;their love to my children at this time. And it \n  will take a lot of<br>&gt;love to<br>&gt;overcome this terrible thing. I send \n  my deepest gratitude to everyone<br>&gt;who<br>&gt;has<br>&gt;written, prayed, \n  chanted, called, emailed etc to share their love<br>&gt;with \n  our<br>&gt;family.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I will try to send out updates after our \n  weekly visits. Please send<br>&gt;us your<br>&gt;love at 10 am Thursdays when \n  we will hug-hug-hug and be a family<br>&gt;united<br>&gt;again<br>&gt;for a \n  few all too short moments.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;In Hope,<br>&gt;Patricia \n  Moodian-Pink<br>&gt;========================================<br>&gt;========================================<br>&gt;Other \n  information for those have have asked:<br>&gt;The family&#39;s attorney has a \n  trust account to hold funds for \n  the<br>&gt;family&#39;s<br>&gt;legal<br>&gt;defense.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Any donations \n  to help huge huge legal costs to<br>&gt;&nbsp; bring the boys home may be made \n  by check payable to:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Mr. David Beauvais,&nbsp; Attorney for \n  Patricia/Hans/Nils Moodian-Pink<br>&gt;<br>&gt;and mailed to his law office \n  at:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1840 Woolsey,&nbsp;&nbsp; Berkeley CA 94704&nbsp; \n  USA<br>&gt;<br>&gt;He may be reached at (510) 845-0504&nbsp;&nbsp; where he \n  will be very busy<br>&gt;trying to<br>&gt;prepare this complicated case and do \n  all of the necessary legal<br>&gt;procedures<br>&gt;to<br>&gt;get Nils and \n  Hans released.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;If you would like to&nbsp; talk about the case \n  and have general questions<br>&gt;Patricia<br>&gt;can be reached late evening \n  at (510)666-0411. Or you can write to her<br>&gt;at<br>&gt;POBox<br>&gt;2632, \n  Berkeley, CA 94702. If you get her 24 hour voice mail leave \n  a<br>&gt;number<br>&gt;where she can call you back collect or even better an \n  email address<br>&gt;she can<br>&gt;write to you at. Her phone bill is huge \n  now due to this case and she<br>&gt;says<br>&gt;she<br>&gt;can not afford to \n  call you&nbsp; unless you would accept a collect call \n  if<br>&gt;you<br>&gt;are<br>&gt;out of her area code. Patricia welcomes all \n  communication. She<br>&gt;realizes her<br>&gt;case is not isolated, and can \n  set a precedent for other families.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;A little legal defense fund \n  Benefit is hoping to happen here \n  in<br>&gt;Berkeley.<br>&gt;Two<br>&gt;excellent Berkeley bands have already \n  volunteered to play at it.<br>&gt;Children&#39;s<br>&gt;entertainers are \n  invited&nbsp; to volunteer. We need a small, free place<br>&gt;to \n  hold<br>&gt;it<br>&gt;where a band could set up and play on a Sunday \n  afternoon, printing,<br>&gt;advertising etc. If any one is interested in \n  helping or has<br>&gt;suggestions<br>&gt;please<br>&gt;contact \n  Patricia<br>&gt;&lt;pattypink@s...&gt;.<br>&gt;----------<br>&gt;&quot;Freedom of \n  Speech is a Precious Right.<br>&gt;&nbsp; Don&#39;t let anyone take away yours or \n  mine.<br>&gt;Children are Precious.<br>&gt;Don&#39;t let anyone take away yours or \n  mine.&quot;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  [from Patricia Moodian-Pink 5/11/2000]<br>&gt;---------<br>&gt;For those who \n  may have missed it -<br>&gt;&nbsp; from the original paperwork to remove and \n  hold the children:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp; Quotes from Screener Narrative before \n  children removed on 4/20/2000:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&quot;The children are \n  homeschooled and never allowed out of her sight.&quot;<br>&gt;&nbsp; &quot;Mom has \n  totally isolated the minors and allows them no contact \n  with<br>&gt;anyone<br>&gt;but her.&quot; &quot;...at risk environment of the \n  minors.&quot;<br>&gt;&nbsp; (These are totally false allegations about two socially \n  active<br>&gt;children<br>&gt;that<br>&gt;are well integrated into their \n  community.)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &#39;Screener Narrative&#39; \n  recommendations:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; \n  3. The children<br>&gt; &gt; enter public school next year, or as soon as \n  their mental health and<br>&gt; &gt; development allows.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Their \n  own records and documents prove what they did to remove \n  the<br>&gt;children<br>&gt;These documents exist,&nbsp; no matter how they try \n  to squirm around after<br>&gt;the<br>&gt;fact. No matter what else they do in \n  new petitions after the wrongful<br>&gt;detention, those words are, in fact, \n  quotes from documents used to<br>&gt;remove<br>&gt;the \n  children.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;In an effort to keep from antagonizing the court \n  Patricia is asking<br>&gt;that<br>&gt;neither the worker nor the court be \n  contacted at this point. That<br>&gt;could<br>&gt;change<br>&gt;in the future \n  depending on many things. For now she is concerned \n  that<br>&gt;they<br>&gt;not<br>&gt;only have her children but could take away \n  the one hour closely<br>&gt;supervised<br>&gt;visit per week that she is \n  allowed with them.&nbsp; She also does not want<br>&gt;to<br>&gt;have<br>&gt;a \n  gag order placed on her so that she is not even allowed to \n  update<br>&gt;others<br>&gt;on<br>&gt;what is happening. In their petitions \n  they tried to get the court to<br>&gt;order<br>&gt;her<br>&gt;not to talk to \n  anyone &quot;in the best interest of the minors.&quot; Patricia<br>&gt;is \n  very<br>&gt;grateful to all who have shown concern for the \n  children.<br>&gt;--- End forwarded message ---<br>&gt;<br><br></tt>\n  <hr>\n\n  <hr>\n  <tt>Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br>Check it \n  all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br><br>To \n  Unsubscribe: \nmailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com<br></tt><br></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8490,"nextTopicId":8487}}
