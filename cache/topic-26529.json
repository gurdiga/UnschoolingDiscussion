We took her to the Amtrak train depot last night to see her off--destination, Vancouver, BC.  Sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were all brave and cheerful waiting in the depot. When the train arrived and she got on board, we remained brave and cheerful.

I think if I let myself worry at all it would consume me, so I just keep projecting good, strong thoughts when I think about her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26512,"nextTopicId":26537}}
