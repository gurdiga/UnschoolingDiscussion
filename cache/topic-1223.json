One reason is probably that<br/>\nits appearance comes in the first days of spring. In addition. it feeds on<br/>\nplant lice, aphids, and many other insects harmful to plants. It is even<br/>\nraised for this purpose in some places.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are hundreds of species of ladybugs. They differ in size and in the<br/>\ncolor and number of spots on their wing cases. There can be anywhere from<br/>\ntwo to 24 spots. In the summer the ladybug flies all day from tree to tree,<br/>\nfrom flower to flower. It eats unbelievable numbers of insects. In winter,<br/>\ngroups of 50-100 hibernate under a piece of bark or in some similar shelter.<br/>\nThe females lay three to 50 eggs on the backs of leaves, When attacked, the<br/>\nladybug has an unusual way of defending itself.
