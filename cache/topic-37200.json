But <br/>\nI&#39;m sitting here bored out of my mind because I&#39;m 9 months pg, so I&#39;m <br/>\ngathering up my courage to post to a few people, even though I&#39;m <br/>\nnew... Feel free to ignore me if you want!  *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\nYour son sounds like the perfect example of a first born/ only child <br/>\nas told in The Birth Order by Kevin Leman.  (actually I think it <br/>\nwas &quot;the new birth order book&quot; or something)  I just<br/>\nfinished that <br/>\nbook this weekend.  It was VERY interesting.  Now, I know we<br/>\ncan&#39;t <br/>\ncategorize every person by their personality type, birth-order, sex, <br/>\netc but there are some definite indicators of personality based<br/>\non our birth order.  I encourage you to read it for a reference.  <br/>\nLeman suggests that because first-borns have only adults to emulate <br/>\nat home, rather than other children, they often set themselves up in<br/>\nthis perfectionist-mode.  A lot of times we as parents encourage <br/>\nthat, especially if we&#39;re first-borns ourselves (like I am). <br/>\n<br/>\nJust something to think about.  I know it&#39;s &quot;pop-psych&quot;<br/>\n but that <br/>\nbook made a lot of sense to me, FWIW!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, just to give you a sample: some advice the author gives is to <br/>\nmake sure your first-born sees that YOU make mistakes, and it&#39;s<br/>\nno big deal.  Say you&#39;re sorry or &quot;I was wrong&quot; if you<br/>\nare. Maybe you <br/>\ncould do an activity together that you&#39;re not so good at, to show <br/>\nyour imperfections?  Like I&#39;m really bad at jigsaw puzzles... so <br/>\nmaybe I could get one and show my child how hard it is for me to put <br/>\ntogether more than the border!  Just a thought *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\nTATE<br/>\n=o)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37203,"nextTopicId":37214}}
