Cacie babbled using speech sounds used in !Kung but not in<br/>\nEnglish, although she hasn&#39;t now used them in years. <br/>\n<br/>\n African American Vernacular English (AKA &quot;ebonics, or Black Standard<br/>\nEnglish) is not  &quot;slang&quot;. The original controversy in Oakland was about<br/>\nwhether or not it was a separate language, with the school district<br/>\narguing that it was. The other POV is that it&#39;s a dialect. AAVE is<br/>\ndefinitely a whole communication system, with its own morphological,<br/>\nphonological, and syntactic rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two leading theories on how AAVE evolved. One is the dialect<br/>\ntheory, which is that African slaves had difficulty learning English and<br/>\nmade a  number of errors, which were then passed on to subsequent<br/>\ngenerations. I don&#39;t like this theory, since the implication for me is<br/>\nthat the African people were stupider than the European people who were<br/>\nable to learn English just fine. The other theory is that the African<br/>\nslaves, coming from many different areas, were trying to develop a way to<br/>\ncommunicate with each other, and in doing so created a pidgin, consisting<br/>\nof Engliagh words, some African vocabulary familiar to many groups, and<br/>\nmany of the African patterns of syntax and phonology. This eventually<br/>\ndeveloped into a creole, that is, a separate language.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I just want to throw in that AAVE if in no way an &quot;inferior&quot;<br/>\nEnglish - it&#39;s a different dialect, or language, depending on your POV,<br/>\nbut no langauge or dialect is better or worse than any other. In many<br/>\ncountries (Sweden comes immediately to mind) many children learn one<br/>\nlanguage at home and another at school, and do fine... these languages<br/>\n(Swedish and Norwegian) are generally understood by speakers of the<br/>\nother, like standard english and AAVE, but are separate, distinct<br/>\nlangauges.<br/>\n<br/>\nI obviously find this fascinating, and have read a lot of books on the<br/>\nsubject, which I would recommend if I could remember the titles...<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!

I haven&#39;t been able to interest Dylan in leaving the house <br/>\nall winter (although he gets out when at friends&#39; homes).

In the<br/>\nmeantime, rather than correct him, you might try paraphrasing him with<br/>\nthe proper words.This demonstrates both that you are listening and how to<br/>\nsay it properly, without scolding.  Y&#39;know, there&#39;s nothing wrong with<br/>\nusing slang.  My children use all kinds of special slang words to talk<br/>\nthat they pick up at the teen center and among friends.  I used to go to<br/>\na school with 3% white and 94% black people.  And I could not believe how<br/>\nsnobby those white people were when they would criticize the slang talk<br/>\nof the black people, which I thought was very cool and<br/>\ninteresting(ebonics?).  I once sang in a choir with Jester Hairston and<br/>\nhe explained how the African slaves could not pronounce certain sounds in<br/>\nEnglish, then passed that style of speech to their children and so forth.<br/>\n He said you wouldn&#39;t criticize a Frenchman for not being able to say<br/>\ncertain vowels or consonants in English.  I come from a hispanic<br/>\nbackground, and my cousins would talk their street chicano slang to their<br/>\nbuddies, then turn around and talk perfect English to me.  I, on the<br/>\nother hand, grew up reading a lot of books and learned languange really<br/>\nby reading so much.  But I still talk like my parents, especially like my<br/>\nstep mom&#39;s family with whom I am very close and they say &quot;ain&#39;t&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;whole &#39;nother&quot; and use all sorts of country bumpkin-type idioms in their<br/>\nconversation.  Sometimes I feel embarrassed that I talk like that and I<br/>\nwork on sounding more dignified, especially when I am speaking in public.<br/>\n But, sure&#39;nuff, at home with my kids I sound like reeeal country<br/>\nbumpkin, if you can do that with a hispanic, high pitched voice like<br/>\nmine.  Then throw in a few curse words I learned from my stepdad, and I<br/>\nam extremely improper in my word usage when I&#39;m relaxed.  But at work, I<br/>\nam very professional.  And with most of my friends I talk clearly and<br/>\nproperly.  My mother is from New York and is extremely articulate, so I<br/>\nmust get that from her.  All this to say, don&#39;t be afraid that people<br/>\nwill not respect your child for the way he speaks.  He will learn on his<br/>\nown that if you want people to respect you and really listen to your<br/>\nopinion, you have to conform a little to accepted standards of<br/>\ncommunication.  But that will probably come by being embarrassed a few<br/>\ntimes rather than by being scolded.<br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2294225,"authorName":"freeform@juno.com","from":"freeform@...","profile":"freeform_ca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Legos,cookies,videogames","postDate":"1014774418","msgId":32160,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMjI2LjE4NDcwOC4tMzEyMzQ5LjQuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":32159,"nextInTopic":32161,"prevInTime":32159,"nextInTime":32161,"topicId":32150,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Wed, 27 Feb 2002 01:04:43 +0000 Freedom Panther ...

How old is your child who is figuring out<br/>\n&gt;multiplication<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   and division on his own with Legos, cookies, and video games?  How is <br/>\n&gt;he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &quot;doing this on this own?&quot;  I guess the real question is, what<br/>\n&gt;interaction do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   you have with him to ensure that he is &quot;learning&quot;  these things?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He&#39;s 8 years old.  It started when he wanted cookies for himself and his<br/>\n&gt;brother - two for each.  &quot;How many is that?&quot;  I&#39;d ask, and he&#39;d count up on<br/>\n&gt;his fingers.  Then I showed him that 2X2 is the same thing as 2+2.  Then I<br/>\n&gt;had to make sure he understood that 3 X 3 wasn&#39;t 3+3, LOL!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He&#39;s also saving money to buy something.  He gets $4 per week allowance.<br/>\n&gt;He&#39;s been figuring out how many weeks it will take to get $38 at $4 per <br/>\n&gt;week<br/>\n&gt;. . . slowly but surely, he&#39;s making the connections.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He gets his Legos and puts them in rows - 4 in one row, and 4 in the next<br/>\n&gt;row, and 4 in the next, and says, &quot;See, Mommy?  4 X 3 is 12!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can tell he&#39;s doing it, because we talk about it.

My children have continued to learn,<br/>\n&gt;day after day, without any structured lessons.  My 8yo is picking up<br/>\n&gt;multiplication on his own.  My 14yo has studied algebra, chemistry and<br/>\n&gt;American and Texas history on his own initiative.  No workbooks - just<br/>\n&gt;plenty of access to the library, to the Internet, to Mom and Dad, and to<br/>\n&gt;other adults who will answer his questions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Read some of John Holt&#39;s books.  Read this article that was in the Houston<br/>\n&gt;Chronicle yesterday.   The author, Crispin Sartwell, is chairman of<br/>\n&gt;humanities and sciences at the Maryland Institute<br/>\n&gt;College of Art in Baltimore:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1262000\">http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1262000</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Deschool yourself.   Know that the educational system doesn&#39;t work, so that<br/>\n&gt;copying it won&#39;t work at home either.  People learn naturally because <br/>\n&gt;that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;what Nature intends for them to do.  Perhaps they won&#39;t learn the same<br/>\n&gt;things kids at school are learning -  but they&#39;ll be able to learn them, at<br/>\n&gt;any time they become important.  An education is not just a<br/>\n&gt;government-mandated set of classes on specific subjects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The longer we unschool, the happier we are with it.  DH thought it would<br/>\n&gt;work for our first child, who is intellectually gifted, but didn&#39;t expect <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;to work for our second, who is intellectually average.  It works well for<br/>\n&gt;both of them.  It&#39;s the &quot;average&quot; kid who&#39;s figuring out multiplication and<br/>\n&gt;division on his own, with Legos and cookies and video games.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It works!
