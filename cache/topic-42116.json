This may not be a true blanket statement.  But my overall feeling of the issue, be it violence, music with &quot;pornographic&quot; lyrics, pornographic literature... etc is that the time you spend engaging your mind in,  really does effect your thinking.  We can see this with other forms of literature.  The argument for reading  Classics is that they don&#39;t dumb down the language for kids. That they help the mind develop by hearing more difficult vocabulary than is heard everyday...and in this way helps the mind to be stretched - <br/>\n<br/>\nIf this can be said of quality literature, entertainment etc. than what is the opposite effect of things that do not help us to become &quot;better people&quot;. If our minds are continually engaged in activities in which violence and offensive lyrics are the norm - then what will we become. Do we not become numb to the effects of it.  Think about just the news,- how many times do we hear about a killing and are shocked? It&#39;s not shocking anymore.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel these art forms are &quot;quality&quot;. I know there are many here that do - and I am not trying to put down your choice of music, or literature - I know there are those that feel they all have value.  I however, have trouble finding the value in &quot;entertainment&quot; that promotes hurting others. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does this have to do with unschooling? Well, for me if unschooling is &quot;living life&quot; and part of life is listening to nasty lyrics - and I am engaging my mind - or watching my children engage their minds in this type of entertainment - that is what I am being educated in - that  is what they are learning. No they may not run out and rape the 12 year old down the road - but they are becoming numb to how horrible it is when it happens. I can not possibly see how this can have value.  Some have said that artists such as Eminem are unearthing their hurts in their music. That&#39;s fine - but WHY do we all run out and buy it! ( I speak of WE as a society in general) Why does this stuff bring in billions - Why do our children relate to this in some way?  If there was not a market for this type of entertainment, it wouldn&#39;t exist. Which to me shows where society is going. To me it looks pretty scary...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42172,"nextTopicId":42096}}
