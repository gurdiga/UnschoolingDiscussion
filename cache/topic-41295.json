But <br/>\nmaking photo copies of your credit cards is a good idea even if the phone <br/>\nnumbers below are bogus.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonya<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;For once here is some Internet info that may actually be helpful to us<br/>\n&gt;:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Place the contents of your wallet on a photocopy machine, do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;both sides of each license, credit card, etc.  You will know what you<br/>\n&gt;had<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in your wallet and all of the account numbers and phone numbers to call<br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;cancel. Keep the photocopy in a safe place.<br/>\n&gt;A corporate attorney sent this out to the employees in his company. I<br/>\n&gt;pass<br/>\n&gt;it along, for your information.<br/>\n&gt;We&#39;ve all heard horror stories about fraud that&#39;s committed<br/>\n&gt;us in your name, address, SS#, credit, etc.  Unfortunately I (the author<br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;this piece who happens to be an attorney) have firsthand knowledge,<br/>\n&gt;because<br/>\n&gt;my wallet was stolen last month and within a week the thieves) ordered<br/>\n&gt;an<br/>\n&gt;expensive monthly cell phone package, applied for a VISA credit card,<br/>\n&gt;had a<br/>\n&gt;credit line approved to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN number<br/>\n&gt;from<br/>\n&gt;DMV to change my driving record information online, and more.<br/>\n&gt;But here&#39;s some critical information to limit the damage in<br/>\n&gt;case this happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always<br/>\n&gt;advises,<br/>\n&gt;cancel your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll<br/>\n&gt;free<br/>\n&gt;numbers and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those<br/>\n&gt;where you can find them easily.   But  also file a police report<br/>\n&gt;immediately<br/>\n&gt;in the jurisdiction where it was stolen, this  proves to credit<br/>\n&gt;providers<br/>\n&gt;you were diligent, and is a first step toward an investigation (if there<br/>\n&gt;ever is one).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But here&#39;s what is perhaps most important: (I never ever<br/>\n&gt;thought to do this)  Call the three national credit reporting<br/>\n&gt;organizations<br/>\n&gt;immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and SS#.<br/>\n&gt;I had never heard of doing that until advised by a bank that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;called to tell me an application for credit was made over the Internet<br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my name.  The alert means any company that checks your credit knows<br/>\n&gt;your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;information was stolen and they have to contact you by phone to<br/>\n&gt;authorize<br/>\n&gt; &gt;new credit. By the  time I was advised to do this, almost 2 weeks after<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;theft, all the damage had been done.<br/>\n&gt;There are records of all the credit checks initiated by the<br/>\n&gt;thieves&#39; purchases, none of which I knew about before placing the alert.<br/>\n&gt;Since then, no additional damage has been done, and the thieves threw my<br/>\n&gt;wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in).  It seems to have<br/>\n&gt;stopped<br/>\n&gt;them in their tracks.<br/>\n&gt;The numbers are:<br/>\n&gt;         Equifax: 1-800-525-6285<br/>\n&gt;         Experian (formerly TRW): 1-888-397-3742<br/>\n&gt;         Trans Union: 1-800-680-7289<br/>\n&gt;         Social Security Administration (fraud line):  1-800-269-0271<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;We pass along jokes; we pass along just about everything. Do<br/>\n&gt;think about passing this information along. It could really help<br/>\n&gt;someone.<br/>\n&gt;I have copied all the addresses, account numbers, and phone<br/>\n&gt;numbers of all my credit cards, driver license, debit cards, etc. and<br/>\n&gt;placed<br/>\n&gt;a copy in my important papers and on my computer.  Very similar to the<br/>\n&gt;above<br/>\n&gt;information. I&#39;ve also made copies and gave to my wife, in case<br/>\n&gt;something<br/>\n&gt;happens to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yeah, I can hear some of you say, &quot;That will take too much time to do&quot;!<br/>\n&gt;Imagine the time it&#39;ll take you to do it after something happens.<br/>\n&gt;The 30 minutes it took me, is well spent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The secret to life isn&#39;t getting what you want it&#39;s wanting it once you get <br/>\nit-Katherine Hepburn in &quot;Love Affair&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember starting the fire is easy, the hardest part is learning how to keep <br/>\nthe flame-Stevie Nicks &quot;Love&#39;s A Hard Game To Play&quot; Timespace<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41293,"nextTopicId":41296}}
