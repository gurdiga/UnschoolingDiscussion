When I was in college, I lived with a girl <br/>\nwhose mother was a clean-freak and who had a maid.  Between the <br/>\nmother and the maid, my roommate had never cleaned anything.  I&#39;d <br/>\nbeen required to clean the entire house every Saturday.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy roommate was constantly nagging me about my messiness because I <br/>\nwas unwilling to clean more often than every Saturday (and dishes <br/>\nbefore bed when it was my turn).  I&#39;d vacuum once a week and she&#39;d <br/>\nvacuum the other six days and yell at me about not doing my share.  <br/>\nI&#39;d do the dishes before bed and she did them one at a time when each <br/>\nbecame dirty.  She thought I was a slob and I thought she was <br/>\nunreasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward to my marriage.  I&#39;ve been married about six years and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve yelled at my husband for being a <br/>\nslob.  I haven&#39;t tried to make the kids do chores, partly because <br/>\nthey&#39;re so young (and partly because they&#39;re more strong-willed than <br/>\nI am).  But I&#39;ve tried repeatedly to get my husband to clean up after <br/>\nhimself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve felt sorry for myself, &quot;I&#39;m the only one who cares how our home <br/>\nlooks.  No matter how often I complain about it, my husband doesn&#39;t <br/>\ntry to be neater.&quot;  And on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;ve been pondering what&#39;s been said about cleaning.  Pondering <br/>\nand pondering.  And I realized I was wrong to demand that my husband <br/>\nclean to my standards, and it&#39;s as unreasonable to him as my roommate <br/>\nseemed to me.  I&#39;ve been thinking about the fact that since I&#39;m the <br/>\nonly one who cares how this place looks, then it&#39;s my job to make it <br/>\nlook the way I want.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I was loading the dishwasher and usually when I get done I <br/>\nask my husband to take out the trash.  To his surprise, I put on my <br/>\nshoes and grabbed the trash bag.  He said, &quot;Are you going to take out <br/>\nthe trash?&quot;  And when I said that I was, he hugged me.  I said, &quot;Do <br/>\nyou really hate doing it that much?&quot;  And he said, &quot;Yes, I really do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually enjoyed taking out the trash.  It was a clear night and <br/>\nthe moon was bright and it was refreshing.  So I came back in and <br/>\ngrabbed the vacuum cleaner.  For the first time ever, my almost-five <br/>\nyear old said, &quot;Can I do it, mommy?&quot;  So I turned it on and sat on <br/>\nthe couch and he very carefully cleaned the entire floor by himself.  <br/>\nAnd he was proud of himself for doing such a good job.  His two-year <br/>\nold brother was clapping for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorcha</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60834,"nextTopicId":60827}}
