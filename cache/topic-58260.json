I don&#39;t monitor her or <br/>\neven ask her to keep me informed on what she is doing.  She eagerly talks <br/>\nwith me about what she encounters and has even survived opening a web site <br/>\nfeaturing pics of &quot;naked women&quot;.  She closed it and told the person who sent <br/>\nthe link that they are &quot;gross&quot;.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nHer friend&#39;s mom (who is MY friend) learned that I don&#39;t stop her from going <br/>\ninto chat rooms and almost fainted.  She covered it by stating that Lanora <br/>\nand I have a different relationship than she and Sarah.  She completely <br/>\nmisses the foundation for the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe sees Sarah&#39;s interests as &quot;her thing&quot; and something she doesn&#39;t want to <br/>\nbe bothered with.  Sarah has learned to keep it to herself along with almost <br/>\nevery emotion and struggle she has.  She tells me MUCH more than she will <br/>\ntell her mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nLanora shares with me freely because it&#39;s natural, her interests have always <br/>\nbeen important to me.  My friend doesn&#39;t see, probably doesn&#39;t want to see, <br/>\nthat an interest on her part would mean openess between she and Sarah now.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58259,"nextTopicId":58254}}
