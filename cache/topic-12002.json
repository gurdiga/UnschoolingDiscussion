But,<br>loving \n  people *are* out there.&nbsp; About foster care:&nbsp; foster care is when \n  a<br>child is removed from a bad situation, and put into the care of \n  another<br>family.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most children that go into foster care do not \n  necessarily end up<br>in juvenile detention centers.&nbsp; Children that go to \n  juv. det. centers are<br>there for discipline reasons.&nbsp; That is not the \n  same as foster care.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One<br>does not equal the other.&nbsp; \n  Many children end up in juv. det. centers that<br>never have been in foster \n  care.&nbsp; They do not necessarily go hand in hand. <br>Adoption does not \n  necessarily go hand in hand with foster care, either. <br>Being an adoptive \n  mother, I know what our birth mom went through.&nbsp; It is<br>such a shame \n  that the law (in our state) prevented us from&nbsp; financially<br>paying her \n  bills.&nbsp; Here she was, making the decision to give life to her<br>unborn \n  child, and was basically getting&nbsp; slapped on the wrist for \n  it.&nbsp;&nbsp; We<br>couldn&#39;t legally buy her groceries, clothing, or \n  anything else.&nbsp; We could<br>legally visit with her, and take her out to \n  dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, it might have<br>been easier,&nbsp; and more \n  convenient for her to have had an abortion.&nbsp; But she<br>took \n  responsibility for her actions, and decided to find parents, and give<br>her \n  child a future.&nbsp; To me, that is very admirable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lynda, I \n  understand<br>how tragic it must have been for you to have seen what that poor \n  baby went<br>through.&nbsp; Instead of focusing on abortion as having been the \n  answer, <br>perhaps the focus should be on preventing pregnancy in the first \n  place. <br>Clearly, that woman had major problems.&nbsp; The child was the \n  victim, but not<br>the problem.&nbsp; Having aborted him would not have \n  changed the woman.&nbsp; She<br>would likely still be relying on abortion as \n  birth control, instead of<br>being more responsible in preventing an unwanted \n  pregnancy.&nbsp; But she did<br>have options.&nbsp; It&#39;s legal-- so why did \n  she not choose to abort?&nbsp; She did<br>not have to have this child.&nbsp; \n  She chose to.&nbsp; She is the problem.&nbsp; She is<br>the one who needed to \n  be dealt with.&nbsp; Clearly, those in *power* made a<br>horrible decision in \n  returning this baby into&nbsp; the monstrous environment <br>from which he \n  came.&nbsp; They , then, played a part in this tragedy, too.&nbsp; For<br>all \n  we know, this woman may have had a history of mental illness. <br>Abortion, to \n  me,&nbsp; would not have been the answer, because it would not have<br>changed \n  the mental capacity of this woman.&nbsp;&nbsp; The child deserved \n  more...<br>from the people who impacted his short life.&nbsp; He was like a \n  sprouted<br>seedling, with a hunger for life.&nbsp; He deserved the same \n  chances that we all<br>want for our own children.&nbsp; After his own mother \n  abused him, the legal<br>system let him down, too.&nbsp; Who knows where he \n  might be today if the<br>situation had been handled correctly?&nbsp; \n  ~Karen<br>&nbsp; ----- Original Message ----- <br>&nbsp;

But,<br/>\nloving people *are* out there.  About foster care:  foster care is when a<br/>\nchild is removed from a bad situation, and put into the care of another<br/>\nfamily.   Most children that go into foster care do not necessarily end up<br/>\nin juvenile detention centers.  Children that go to juv. det. centers are<br/>\nthere for discipline reasons.  That is not the same as foster care.    One<br/>\ndoes not equal the other.  Many children end up in juv. det. centers that<br/>\nnever have been in foster care.  They do not necessarily go hand in hand. <br/>\nAdoption does not necessarily go hand in hand with foster care, either. <br/>\nBeing an adoptive mother, I know what our birth mom went through.  It is<br/>\nsuch a shame that the law (in our state) prevented us from  financially<br/>\npaying her bills.  Here she was, making the decision to give life to her<br/>\nunborn child, and was basically getting  slapped on the wrist for it.   We<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t legally buy her groceries, clothing, or anything else.  We could<br/>\nlegally visit with her, and take her out to dinner.    Yes, it might have<br/>\nbeen easier,  and more convenient for her to have had an abortion.  But she<br/>\ntook responsibility for her actions, and decided to find parents, and give<br/>\nher child a future.  To me, that is very admirable.   Lynda, I understand<br/>\nhow tragic it must have been for you to have seen what that poor baby went<br/>\nthrough.  Instead of focusing on abortion as having been the answer, <br/>\nperhaps the focus should be on preventing pregnancy in the first place. <br/>\nClearly, that woman had major problems.  The child was the victim, but not<br/>\nthe problem.  Having aborted him would not have changed the woman.  She<br/>\nwould likely still be relying on abortion as birth control, instead of<br/>\nbeing more responsible in preventing an unwanted pregnancy.  But she did<br/>\nhave options.  It&#39;s legal-- so why did she not choose to abort?  She did<br/>\nnot have to have this child.  She chose to.  She is the problem.  She is<br/>\nthe one who needed to be dealt with.  Clearly, those in *power* made a<br/>\nhorrible decision in returning this baby into  the monstrous environment <br/>\nfrom which he came.  They , then, played a part in this tragedy, too.  For<br/>\nall we know, this woman may have had a history of mental illness. <br/>\nAbortion, to me,  would not have been the answer, because it would not have<br/>\nchanged the mental capacity of this woman.   The child deserved more...<br/>\nfrom the people who impacted his short life.  He was like a sprouted<br/>\nseedling, with a hunger for life.  He deserved the same chances that we all<br/>\nwant for our own children.  After his own mother abused him, the legal<br/>\nsystem let him down, too.  Who knows where he might be today if the<br/>\nsituation had been handled correctly?  ~Karen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Lynda <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, August 17, 2000 1:57 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] our bodies-Julie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  There is no shortage of people to adopt perfect babies.
