(you can write me if you<br/>\nwant the exact program.)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has told her piano teacher not to attend - she&#39;s doing this for<br/>\nfun, she says, and doesn&#39;t want his comments on her playing.<br/>\n&quot;Besides,&quot; she says, &quot;I know when I make mistakes, so what&#39;s the point?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut she wants to fill the place because, after all, &quot;we need the<br/>\nmoney.&quot; I&#39;m pinching myself, and, as my wife duly advises, trying to<br/>\nkeep my big mouth shut (which, as folks who know me can attest, can be<br/>\nquite a trial.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, Meera has made quite clear that she wants ME to fill the<br/>\nplace up (there are 700 seats, gulp!)
