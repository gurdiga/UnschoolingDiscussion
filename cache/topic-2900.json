Although I most definitely would not have done the summer thang the way you did I definitely have to agree with you.    I liked the points you made (and your 5 yr old sounds like a hoot) but it saddens me that even now and even on a list like this one there are still times when a home/unschooling mom feels like she has to preface or apologize for talking about the way that her family runs smoothly.  I guess I&#39;m talking about that sometimes heated debate over child-led vs. discipline.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe in child led, but I also believe in give and take.  *And I think there are more of us out there than you might think.  There are many  *radical unschooling moms who * also take a hand as well as lend it you know.  We tend to be quieter but we&#39;re out there.  Personally I believe pushing your child is wrong.  But a gentle nudge?  No prob.  The way I see it I don&#39;t believe that all children are lazy or lethargic or that they all need to Pavlovian motivation (the way the majority of the American school system believes) but I do believe they are human.  And we humans can be a tad stubborn and yes, sometimes even a little lazy (gasp!) at times.  That nasty bug procrastination can bite any of us.  Even children.  I think most of us can think of a time when we could have kicked ourselves for taking so long to do something or other.    A friendly nudge in the right direction balanced with loving discipline can sometimes be just the ticket.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I want that T-shirt!<br/>\n<br/>\nciao, Sessuale2323<br/>\n<br/>\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://2makemoney.hypermart.net\">http://2makemoney.hypermart.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\nStay home AND Make Money!<br/>\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tD.
