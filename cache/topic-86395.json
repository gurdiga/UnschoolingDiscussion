I just wanted to mention that all <br/>\nchildren develop at their own rates and although evaluators <br/>\n(teachers,therapists,etc) do their best to put an &quot;age equivalent&quot; on a child&#39;s progress...they are <br/>\ncomparing to the &quot;average&quot; which means some children are above that age range <br/>\nand some below.  <br/>\nEarly intervention services are certainly helpful if they are well done and <br/>\npreferably in your own home so that the parents can learn the techniques used <br/>\nas well. <br/>\nMy son is getting preschool spec ed services this year which seems to be <br/>\nhelpful so far and has none of the stigma of school-age services.  I&#39;ve just <br/>\nrecently been really considering hs him and reconsidering my former chosen career.  <br/>\nThe school system really does a disservice to kids in special ed programs as <br/>\nmost children do not fit into a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach.<br/>\nBest of luck with all of your children.  I do suggest accepting early <br/>\nintervention services if they are approved b/c it is the best time to help many <br/>\nchildren with developmental delays...but don&#39;t feel bad about it.  Just spending <br/>\ntime playing with 2 year olds is what most of the therapy consists of.  Good <br/>\nluck.  <br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":86380,"nextTopicId":86345}}
