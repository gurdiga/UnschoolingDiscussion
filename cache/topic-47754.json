As  a mom to a 3 1/2 year old girl who has <br/>\nalready broken her arm twice (one wrist at age 13 months, one break just <br/>\nabove the elbow this past summer), I can testify that accidents happen when <br/>\nyou least expect it - and even if you&#39;re there. Kalie broke her wrist when <br/>\nshe was learning to walk - she let go of the couch she was teetering along, <br/>\nand landed &quot;wrong&quot; on her wrist. The second break this past summer, she was <br/>\nvery tired and sort of slid off the end of her bed at nighttime -- she wasn&#39;t <br/>\neven fooling around, just tired, and must have put her arm straight out to <br/>\nbreak her fall, and broke it near the elbow. We were so concerned that she <br/>\nhad some sort of bone weakness or something frightening, but, as our doctor <br/>\nputs it, she &quot;just earned herself two good breaks&quot;. (&quot;Devastated&quot; just barely <br/>\ncovers how we felt!) <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I compare these two accidents to the number of times she&#39;s fallen, <br/>\ntripped, run into things, etc. without damage, it calms me somewhat, but I <br/>\nadmit to being a little bit stifling &quot;in the name of safety&quot; myself. However, <br/>\nwhat I&#39;m attempting now is to give her MORE freedom to run and jump and play <br/>\nand climb (OK, I&#39;m always nearby, but I try to stifle my own gasps when she <br/>\ndoes fall). My reasoning is that the more skills and strength she develops, <br/>\nthe less likely she is to be hurt. We&#39;re both enjoying this approach a lot <br/>\nmore!<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kimber&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snibbor@...\">snibbor@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nI will also say that most of the breaks in children (that I saw) were from <br/>\ntypical every day goofin&#39; off or those all too common accidents that happen <br/>\nto all.    Climbing trees, trampoline falls, fingers shut in the car door, <br/>\nand sports injuries.  The few times a toddler was brought in with a broken <br/>\nbone, the parents were just devastated because they felt so bad about not <br/>\n&#39;being there&#39; to prevent the fall/injury.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;People stifle toddlers too much in the name of safety.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was guilty of that myself with my first.  Much more relaxed with my second. <br/>\n Actually, it was not too common for toddlers to come in with broken bones.  <br/>\nThey are very resilient.  Most of the little ones just had a bump on the <br/>\nhead....it seems like mine always had a bump/bruise from falling off of <br/>\nsomething so I guess I wasn&#39;t too stifling.  :) <br/>\n<br/>\nKimber<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47748,"nextTopicId":47749}}
