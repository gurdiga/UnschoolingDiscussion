He seems to do it to <br/>\nget a rise out of whomever is the unliked one.  Mostly, that&#39;s my son.  But <br/>\nmy son doesn&#39;t really respond, I think he understands it&#39;s ok not to like his <br/>\nfriend sometimes too.  This boy gets a rise out of his mother instead.  Once, <br/>\nI suggested we leave and he decided that wasn&#39;t a good idea.

He smiled.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, the child was begging for a reaction, a negative attention is <br/>\nbetter than no attention kind of thing.
