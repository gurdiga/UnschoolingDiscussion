I don&#39;t suppose they grew up in Alaska or ever climbed a mountain then. hehe<br/>\nDriving from Fairbanks to Valdez requires that a person be a bit flexible about facilities for pissing and defecating (or any drive in that great state). And having pursued mountain climbing in former years kept me fairly humble. I was always climbing with men, and you just don&#39;t whine about stuff like that.<br/>\nI&#39;ve done serious business on Mt.Adams and Mt. Hood both. Mt.Saint Helens was a quick enough climb that you could usually avoid serious stuff, just a pee here and there would getcha through the day.:) I can&#39;t tell you how it feels to have your bum hanging over a hole you just dug on a side of a mountain, cold snow all &#39;round and people climbing up the ridge behind ya. Something you just have to experience for yourself. I CAN tell you it comes out quick, nothing like fear to get things going. sheesh.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30221,"nextTopicId":87579}}
