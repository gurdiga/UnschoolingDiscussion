I was discussing it again with my friend who has to read","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-902163873\">Hi, all~<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems my quick post needs a little clarifying, so here goes (warning, <br/>\nit&#39;s long).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was discussing it again with my friend who has to read constantly - <br/>\nand by constantly I mean all the time when she&#39;s awake, whatever she <br/>\nglances at she&#39;s got to read, or at least scan, or she has to work at it <br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe confirmed what I was remembering:  dyslexia is a neurological <br/>\ndisorder, affecting the parts of the brain that handle language.  And <br/>\nwhile yes, English, especially the &quot;American&quot; dialect, is a nasty thing <br/>\nto inflict on younglings, it isn&#39;t the culprit here.  From what I&#39;ve <br/>\nlearned about how the brain works (over the last 20+ years), it would <br/>\nseem to me that adding additional languages to the mix would <br/>\nautomatically encourage not only the continual addition of neurological <br/>\nconnections, but also do so across more areas of the brain - including <br/>\nacross both hemispheres.  This wider network would allow for more <br/>\nredundancy, thus helping someone combat the neurological disorder that <br/>\nis dyslexia (where the working of the neuro-network is screwy, for some <br/>\nreason).<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect no two cases of dyslexia are identical, so one can take heart <br/>\nin another thing my friend found out, during her college years - a <br/>\nprofessor pointed out that she consistently made the *same sets* of <br/>\nmistakes, almost as if her brain had certain ciphers, or codes, that it <br/>\nused.  So, adding in that another part - of her disorder? her specific <br/>\nneurology? they don&#39;t know - is that, once having identified the sets of <br/>\nmistakes she routinely makes (due to the disorder), she can predict <br/>\nthem, and also use that knowledge to edit what she writes, and even what <br/>\nshe says.  I&#39;ve had her do the latter in conversations with her, where <br/>\nshe catches herself, corrects the mistake, and we go on.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo biggie, really.  But she does suspect that that disorder had a hand <br/>\nin her only really being able to &#39;read&#39; read by around 5.5-6 yrs of <br/>\nage.  (&#39;read&#39; read = complex stuff, not the &quot;See Jim run&quot; kind of stuff.)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Just fyi, here, but I don&#39;t know when I learned to read (I do know that <br/>\nit was &quot;read&quot; reading, not just kiddie stuff, because that&#39;s what I was <br/>\ninterested in as well as exposed to) - but it wasn&#39;t until I was 4 that <br/>\nmy handwriting and knowledge of how to spell my name well enough <br/>\ncombined so I could sign-to-get my first library card. Gosh, that&#39;s such <br/>\na neat, and empowering, memory!]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other friend did speak and (with limited ability) read English as a <br/>\nchild.  Things just never really worked properly until her brain added <br/>\nGerman, too.  And she doesn&#39;t *always have to* re-route into and out of <br/>\nGerman - just when she gets stuck or &quot;stumbles&quot; in English.  I have to <br/>\nsay, though, it&#39;s really cute when she spouts off in German to my kids!  <br/>\nThey&#39;re used to English and various dialects of Chinese, even Japanese <br/>\n(we&#39;re big into quality Anime, here, especially stuff from Studio <br/>\nGhibli), so they look at her like she&#39;s suddenly shown that she&#39;s an <br/>\nalien from another planet - then they relax and look at her like she&#39;s a <br/>\nlikeable, but really  weird, person.  &lt;chuckle&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I&#39;m thinking of getting a copy of that book, myself - it sounds <br/>\nreally interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as far as any type of schooling goes - whether &quot;un&quot; or not - I <br/>\nsuspect that it is really up to us as parents to keep close track of the <br/>\npatterns our children show and share with us.  I know when I was oh, <br/>\nmaybe from 3-10, I had to keep track of whether I wrote a &quot;b&quot; or a &quot;d,&quot; <br/>\nrather than switching them.  It was strictly a written problem, not a <br/>\nverbal or reading one; but my Mom was the one who pointed it out to me, <br/>\nand helped me keep track of it until I showed her that I was responsible <br/>\non this issue, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;d try to keep track of the problems, and see if there are any <br/>\npatterns.  The brain is so complex we&#39;ll still be studying it for <br/>\ncenturies before there&#39;s any kind of &quot;guidebook&quot; to how it works, so <br/>\njust keep track of patterns and use them for a corrective guide, I&#39;d say.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and as far as I know, while they&#39;ve just &quot;discovered&quot; that humans <br/>\nstill add neurological connections throughout life (**explaining the <br/>\npeople who facilitate languages easily), the vast majority of the <br/>\nlanguage sets are hardwired into babies before they are a year old.  It <br/>\nmight be by 8-10 months, I can&#39;t remember exactly.  After that, they&#39;re <br/>\nbrains are programmed to easily work with that native language or <br/>\nlanguages, and additional ones are going to have to be worked at.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s a big reason I&#39;ve been trying to expose my children to Cantonese <br/>\nand Mandarin - I want them to be able to add the more difficult stuff as <br/>\nI can provide it to them, knowing that they&#39;ve already gotten the early <br/>\nhard-wiring done.  That&#39;s why there are so many multi-lingual baby <br/>\nlearning toys.  And it&#39;s supposed to add a better ability for other <br/>\nskills, like math, later on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this isn&#39;t the only stuff that gets hardwired early, either.  For <br/>\nexample: According to lots of studies done, language skills start <br/>\ndeteriorating between the ages of about 8-12, so if you&#39;ve not gotten it <br/>\nin by then, you&#39;ve got more work to do to garner the same quality of <br/>\nskill-sets.  On the other hand, learning is always interrupted by major <br/>\nhormonal changes, especially around growth spurts, so that adds more <br/>\ntwists and turns to the whole thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut none of that kind of stuff is affected by racial differences.  Maybe <br/>\nby cultural ones, since that&#39;s how we&#39;re raised (the whole &#39;nature vs. <br/>\nnurture&#39; thing), but when it comes down to how we function, it&#39;s pretty <br/>\nmuch that we&#39;re all just... human.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Oh, and the people who learn lots of languages easily as an adult?  <br/>\nBeyond an individual&#39;s inherent ability to learn that kind of stuff <br/>\nwell, the basis of language is really all about ciphering - codes.

However, if she was <br/>\nborn and raised in the USA she would&#39;ve been exposed to English <br/>\neverywhere, even in a non-learning enviroment (i.e., outside of <br/>\nschool).  You simply can&#39;t get away from it, English is everywhere.  <br/>\nWe are immersed in it.  Yet, she has to &#39;think&#39; in German to <br/>\ntranslate into English.  That is amazing!  She didn&#39;t grow up being <br/>\nexposed to German on a daily basis and yet she has to &#39;think&#39; in <br/>\nGerman to get English.  They say Dyslexia is a language barrier.  My <br/>\nson has had zero pressure to learn to read.  The only pressure is <br/>\noccasionally directed towards me from others.  He is not traumatized <br/>\nby the English language whatsoever.  He is immersed in it, but yet <br/>\nright now he finds Spanish more appealing.  My sister&#39;s daughter is <br/>\n11 y/o and I know she has had no pressure to learn to read.  If there <br/>\nis any pressure it is from my mother towards my sister to do <br/>\nsomething.  I trust that she&#39;ll read when she is ready, just as I do <br/>\nwith my son.  Yet, it took her friend into her adult years until she <br/>\nlearned German on her own.  For some reason, whether it was trauma or <br/>\nnot, her brain related to German and she finally had all the elements <br/>\nshe needed in place to learned how to read.  On the other hand, her <br/>\nother friend has to continually work at it or she regresses.  Could <br/>\nit be that some element is still missing for her, even though she <br/>\nknows other languages?  Sure, she is reading and knows other <br/>\nlanguages, but even as an adult she still struggles.  She couldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave experienced trauma with all the languages that she knows, could <br/>\nshe?  I don&#39;t know if she has trouble only with English or the other <br/>\nlanguages she knows as well.  I don&#39;t know much about dyslexia, but <br/>\nit seems to me that trauma can&#39;t be the cause of it.  The other gal <br/>\nfrom the UK who responded would probably tell you her girls were not <br/>\ntraumatized either.  A response from her in this regard would be <br/>\nhelpful.  It makes me interested in reading that book recommended <br/>\nhere now, because maybe I&#39;m missing something.  Like I said, I may be <br/>\noff here, but I find the learning of other languages an intriguing <br/>\npossibility, perhaps its finding the right one that relates to our <br/>\ngenetic make-up?<br/>\nRobin  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 3/21/2005 8:46:42 AM Mountain Standard Time,  <br/>\n&gt; nasafellow@c... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One  never learned to read properly, partly from problems with the <br/>\ndyslexia,  <br/>\n&gt; until she went to Germany with her now ex-husband and learned <br/>\nGerman.  <br/>\n&gt; Since then, she was able to go back and re-learn English, though <br/>\nshe  admits <br/>\n&gt; sometimes she kind of has to think it in German then translate it  <br/>\ninto <br/>\n&gt; English.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; It seems, though, that she just didn&#39;t have any trauma associated <br/>\nwith  <br/>\n&gt; learning to read German.

When first graders are told they are reading, and are getting  A&#39;s in <br/>\nreading, and bringing something home to read aloud, that seems like a big  <br/>\ndeal, but hand one the current issue of Time or Newsweek, and you&#39;ll find out he  <br/>\ncan&#39;t &quot;really&quot; read.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s just really different, to wait until a child has all the elements in  <br/>\nplace in his own mind to figure out reading for himself.  &quot;Properly&quot; means  <br/>\nfunctionally for that person.  Different people read in different ways, and  <br/>\nthere&#39;s no getting around that.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Dyslexia / eyes","postDate":"1111410278","msgId":104689,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5Yi4zMDFkMDcyMC4yZjcwMjA2NkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":104688,"nextInTopic":104692,"prevInTime":104688,"nextInTime":104690,"topicId":104685,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/20/2005 9:05:57 PM Central Standard Time, primalmother@yahoo.com writes: Anyhow,  my 7 y/o is having surgery for his crossed eyes in May.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-728637440\">In a message dated 3/20/2005 9:05:57 PM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:primalmother@...\">primalmother@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow,  my 7 y/o is having surgery for his crossed eyes in <br/>\nMay.
