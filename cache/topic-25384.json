Sometimes it takes a second reading to find out what people are<br/>\nreally saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra said &quot;Your WRITING isn&#39;t indicating&quot; and &quot;you haven&#39;t SHOWN or TOLD<br/>\nus&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n*All* that people have to discuss are what we *choose* to say. What we<br/>\n*choose* (*and* not choose) to say builds a picture in someone else&#39;s head.<br/>\nIt&#39;s the point of communication.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the majority of our words and examples are about control, regardless of<br/>\nhow much we *say* we are free, then people can&#39;t help but build up a mental<br/>\npicture of control.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuite often our words can convey more than the simple meanings of the words<br/>\nbecause they are in a common cultural context. If I say &quot;I ate at McDonalds<br/>\nyesterday&quot; it conveys more than &quot;I ate at Jason&#39;s yesterday.&quot; The second<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t convey more than I didn&#39;t eat at home. The first carries an<br/>\nimpression of ambience, food, price, architecture, patrons.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly if I say &quot;I ate at Mr. Donuts&quot; to an American it would carry<br/>\none impression, but a different impression to a Japanese person. (They sell<br/>\nChinese food there along with the donuts!)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can call house maintenance stuff chores if you like, but if the general<br/>\ncultural connotation of &quot;chores&quot; is different than what you mean, then what<br/>\nyou&#39;ve communicated isn&#39;t what you&#39;ve intended. Happens all the time,<br/>\nespecially when talking to people who don&#39;t share our cultural or family<br/>\ncontext. But it isn&#39;t the recipients who is wrong in their interpretation.<br/>\nThe responsibility is on the person who&#39;s trying to communicate. *If* their<br/>\npurpose is communication. *If* someone finds it more important to be right<br/>\nthan to communicate then the rules are different, of course ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25352,"nextTopicId":13491}}
