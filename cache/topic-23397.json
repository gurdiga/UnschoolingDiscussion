They scream, hit, run, fight, whine, and are close to uncontrollable.  The middle one-a boy, is especially horrid when he is tired.  He seems to be in hyper-drive and zips around half killing himself and anyone in his path.  They all 3 are easily frustrated and tend to slam anything (or anyone) that does not cooperate into the nearest wall.  They need constant feedback and assistance.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids, on the other hand, while not perfect, tend to be very laid-back and calm.  They mind well, they don&#39;t backtalk, they can talk to each other and to adults in plain, clear words-never screaming and using bad words, or throwing things.  My friend is CONSTANTLY begging me to tell her what to do about her kids.  When we are out in public, she comes to me to make them stop fighting, or let someone else have a turn.  She just says, &quot;Esther, I need some discipline in here.&quot;  I don&#39;t yell at them, and certainly have never spanked them, but they listen to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just had been thinking to myself that she needed to be firmer and follow through on a few threats, but reading the descriptions in some of the posts here, I have to wonder.
