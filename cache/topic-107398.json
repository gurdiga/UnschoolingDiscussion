Do you give your kids as much freedom with making dating <br/>\ndecisions  as<br/>\nyou do other things in their lives?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYes. Very much so.<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron has a girlfriend now---they&#39;ve been dating for over two years.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk a lot. A lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk about kissing and dates and sex and parenting and children&#39;s <br/>\nnames and sex and in-laws and condoms and birth control pills and date <br/>\nrape and sex and marriage and weddings and grandparents and <br/>\ngynocologists and sex and siblings and movies and home-buying and <br/>\ndecorating and sex and ..... &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe always include the girlfriend (not just this one---former <br/>\ngirlfriends too) in family plans---like parties and suppers and <br/>\nsometimes trips. I would certinaly not hesitate to invite this boy to <br/>\nsupper. That&#39;s practically routine here! I often invite the parent(s) <br/>\nas well. That way they aren&#39;t afraid of *us*!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust be open and friendly and let him know you trust him to be kind and <br/>\nsweet with your daughter. Let her know she can call you *any*time if <br/>\nshe feels uncomfortable. Make sure she has $$ in her pocket in case she <br/>\nneeds it. Don&#39;t treat her like a five year old. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLord, If I&#39;d waited to date until I was ready to get married---I may <br/>\nhave waited forever! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBreak-ups are almost inevitable.  Heartbreaks are too. Part of the <br/>\ndating process is to start to feel comfortable in such a role and to <br/>\nmake early decisions/judgments on what/who will make a good spouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn another time, your fifteen year old might already be married with <br/>\ntwo children! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust her.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an almost 15 year old daughter who wants to go out with a boy at <br/>\nour<br/>\nchurch.  He&#39;s really nice, good family, but he&#39;s 16 and drives.   <br/>\nShould we<br/>\njust invite him over here?  None of my other kids were even  interested <br/>\nin<br/>\ndating until they were much older, usually over 17 or even  18.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would never insist on courtship...I think that&#39;s really  controlling. <br/>\n But<br/>\nit makes sense to start dating when you&#39;re at the age  you&#39;re ready to <br/>\nget<br/>\nmarried.  I can see the point to it.   My almost 20 year old broke up <br/>\nwith a<br/>\nboyfriend of over a year, and he was  very upset over it.  It broke her <br/>\nheart<br/>\nbecause he would call up  crying...she doesn&#39;t want to be with him (he <br/>\nhas a lot<br/>\n<br/>\nof bad issues...long  story) but she doesn&#39;t want him to hurt.  She <br/>\ncalled me<br/>\nupset saying,  &quot;How do I help him not to hurt??!&quot;  Ugh...I got off the <br/>\nphone<br/>\nand  cried myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat decisions have you come to with your kids over dating?

I asked her what that meant and she said &quot;you don&#39;t go out with anyone else&quot;.  I asked what happens when you meet someone else you would like to do stuff with.  She said you get their number and call them later, then tell the first person you don&#39;t want to go out anymore.  So, it seems that this going out, at least at this stage in her life, is not much of a commitment.  Henry is the first boy who has shown this level of interest in her.  One of the things Lisa and I have discussed is that she really doesn&#39;t know him that well.  As time goes by and she gets to know him better, she will either decide that she really likes spending time with him or that she doesn&#39;t, after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey talk on the phone alot - probably for a couple of hours every day.  They have gone to the movies twice, both times in a group and in the daytime, with parents doing the driving.  This boy and his friend met my dd and her friend(s) at the theater.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two boys came to the park last week for a free outdoor concert that we were attending.  They all wandered around the park talking in a group of 2 boys and 3 girls.  They didn&#39;t come to where dh and I were sitting, but I walked to where they were and chatted for a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past Monday, my neighbor, Sue, was visiting.  My mom and Sue&#39;s dad were both in town, so we&#39;d all gotten together for coffee that morning.  Lisa asked if I would take her and Sue&#39;s dd to the movie.  I reminded her that my car was in the shop, so I couldn&#39;t, but I could take them another day after the car was fixed.  Sue thought a movie sounded like a good idea and offered to take the girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the coffee visit was over (and my mom left right after that too) Lisa told me that Henry and his friend Eddy (also 13) were going to meet them at the movie.  She realized that she needed to tell Sue this (that it wasn&#39;t just Bailey and my dd at the movie), but hadn&#39;t wanted to say it in front of everyone who had been there for coffee.  I asked if she wanted to tell Sue or wanted me to - she asked if I would.  I called Sue, who didn&#39;t mind that the two boys would be there and was impressed that Lisa had wanted her to know, rather than being sneaky about it.  (Sue happens to be a school teacher and a rather controlling parent.  Her kids go to school.  She is the one who told me that she feared Lisa was on the road to delinquency when she died her hair tips black with a red rinse over all.  Her daughter, Bailey, has &quot;agreed&quot; with her parents to not date until she is 16, and to date responsibly once she is able.  She is 11 now.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn our way to the park Wednesday, my dd Jackie said to Lisa, &quot;Are you going to tell her?&quot;  Lisa said, &quot;not yet&quot;.  As we were getting out of the car, Lisa told me that she and Henry held hands at the movie.  I thanked her for telling me.  Then she said that Bailey and Eddy had held hands too.  Remember Bailey, the one who isn&#39;t going to date until 16?  This was the first time that she had met Eddy in person.  And, I&#39;m told that Eddy has a girlfriend, but she has not been around during the times when I&#39;ve seen the boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:dating","postDate":"1122043954","msgId":107410,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM0LjJiZGU1YTE5LjMwMTI2MjMyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107404,"nextInTopic":107412,"prevInTime":107409,"nextInTime":107411,"topicId":107398,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/22/2005 6:24:27 AM Eastern Standard Time, UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com writes: I meant  that I hopo her dates can be fun...I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-104536791\">In a message dated 7/22/2005 6:24:27 AM Eastern Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nI meant  that I hopo her dates can be fun...I guess superficial isn&#39;t the   <br/>\nword to use...I mean that she can date boys without getting deep into a  <br/>\nserious  <br/>\nrelationship with ONE boy.

She is  <br/>\nyoung, and you want very, very badly for her never to get hurt by those scary  <br/>\nboys. (In my case it would be those scary girls, as I have a son.) <br/>\n <br/>\nThose Christian Arranged Courtships, or even better, NO courtship but  <br/>\narranged marriages seem pretty appealing about now, don&#39;t they? But we know  you&#39;re <br/>\nnot really like that, and you&#39;re going to take a deep breath, whine a  little <br/>\nto your friends or partner about it, then be really supportive of your  <br/>\ndaughters leap into this next life adventure.<br/>\n <br/>\nShe might discover that she just likes to go out and keep it light. She  <br/>\nmight fall madly in love. He might be sweet and smart and fit into your family  <br/>\nright off. He might be a jerk.<br/>\n <br/>\nSure, have her invite him over to the house if you like. Make sure he&#39;s a  <br/>\nlegal and safe driver. But trust your daughter. She might date lots of people,  <br/>\nlearning what&#39;s important to her in a partner. She might just date this guy,  <br/>\nhaving found her partner early, learning what she needs to do to build a  <br/>\nrelationship with him. She might date him, and learn what a relationship looks  <br/>\nlike, so she&#39;s better equipped for her next relationship. She may discover she  <br/>\nprefers to be alone.  It&#39;s all unschooling -- learning from life, whatever  <br/>\npath she finds.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;ll be okay. For parents, as well as young adults, it IS scary.
