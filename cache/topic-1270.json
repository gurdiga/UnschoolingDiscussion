A student needs to have completed a 4-year degree in college before going on to medical school.  Many students who did not complete math and science requirements in high school can take them in college later.  A number of hs highschoolers do what is called &quot;double-dipping,&quot; they attend community college classes to fulfill high school requirements or personal interests and at the same time get a jump on some college credit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany colleges are now actively recruiting homeschooled students.  They are finding that contrary to the notion that hs&#39;ed students are unprepared, they are independent and creative learners and an asset to the student body.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd (I say this very gently) a 13 year old will probably change his/her mind a dozen times before settling on a career that requires long years of schooling and many thousands of dollars.  I believe this is as it should be, this is an age for exploring, not locking themselves in to a particular path.  If your 13 year old is already committed to this, he/she will begin exploring the sciences and higher mathematics, and only needs support and resources.  If these kids need structure, they often create their own.  And I believe, again, that this, not structure imposed from the outside (by me!) is the basis for self discipline that is so valuable later in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,  Jane<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: MOX &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mox@...\">mox@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ru@...\">ru@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ru@...\">ru@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Cc: Oregon Homeschooling Discussion List &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ORSIG@...\">ORSIG@...</a>&gt;; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UN-SCHOOL@onelist.com\">UN-SCHOOL@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UN-SCHOOL@onelist.com\">UN-SCHOOL@onelist.com</a>&gt;; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Sunday, June 27, 1999 3:31 AM<br/>\n    Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] to be a dr.-advice please<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Hi everyone! <br/>\n    I&#39;d like some input on this one: A child (now 13) wants to be a doctor-surgeon of some type.

How can this <br/>\nhappen if the child is unschooling from this age on (has been in ps up to <br/>\nthis point)?**<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly by deschooling yourself and reading a lot about unschooling :-)  One <br/>\nof the hardest parts is to imagine reaching a goal by wandering about <br/>\nseemingly aimlessly.  But how did he learn to talk?  By having the will and <br/>\nexploring at random, right?  And I bet he mastered it, regardless of what <br/>\nroute he took.<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* he truely wants to be a doctor/surgeon, it&#39;ll happen.  He&#39;ll be <br/>\nmotivated enough to learn what he needs to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt only seems like an enormous task when looked at in schoolish terms.  But <br/>\nthat&#39;s because schools approach learning from the wrong direction.  Schools <br/>\ngive kids the facts, then trust they&#39;ll come up with a reason for using them. <br/>\n Through unschooling, we can let kids find the reasons and then they&#39;ll be <br/>\nmotivated to learn the facts -- and quite often just absorb the facts as they <br/>\nare exploring for the fun of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have A.D.A.M. The Inside Story software?  Lots of great anatomy stuff <br/>\nto explore freeform.  Dorling Kindersley has some excellent software and <br/>\nmight have something similar or related.  (www.dk.com)  Check out Discovery <br/>\nand Learning Channels and PBS for science shows that might be even remotely <br/>\nrelated to biology.  (They all have websites and programming guides.)  <br/>\nDiscover magazine is excellent and often has biology articles in it.  In a <br/>\nyear or two he can probably volunteer at a hospital.  There&#39;s Grays Anatomy <br/>\ncoloring book.  There are cow&#39;s eye and frog dissection programs on line.  <br/>\nAnd there are things to order from Carolina Biological Supply catalog.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are all just few ideas of things to have around.  They are not things <br/>\nthat will teach him to be a doctor.  Let him explore.  If he&#39;s drawn towards <br/>\ndoctorish stuff, then he&#39;ll end up as a doctor.  If he&#39;s naturally drawn to <br/>\nother things, he&#39;ll head off on another path and it would have been a mistake <br/>\nto urge him down the more narrow doctor path even if that&#39;s what he says he <br/>\nwants.<br/>\n<br/>\n**I feel like a good start would be Grace Lewelyn&#39;s &quot;Teenage Liberation <br/>\nHandbook&quot; but what else should one think about or do?**<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s an excellent start.  And after you read it you&#39;ll have a better idea <br/>\nof what you need to ask about.<br/>\n<br/>\n**How could we research if medical schools take hsed/unsed children?**<br/>\n<br/>\nHarvard takes homeschooled/unschooled kids so what else is there to know? ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut just in case, check out:<br/>\n<br/>\n� &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.learninfreedom.org/&quot;\">http://www.learninfreedom.org/&quot;</a>&gt;School Is Dead; Learn in Freedom!<br/>\n&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.learninfreedom.org/\">http://www.learninfreedom.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n� &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.concentric.net/~Ctcohen/&quot;\">http://www.concentric.net/~Ctcohen/&quot;</a>&gt;Homeschool / Teens / College<br/>\n&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.concentric.net/~Ctcohen/\">http://www.concentric.net/~Ctcohen/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n� &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling/&quot;\">http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling/&quot;</a>&gt;A to Z Home&#39;s Cool - <br/>\nHomeschooling Web Site<br/>\n&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling\">http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\n**Since he has been in the ps system would it be wise for him to continue <br/>\nconsidering his goal or not?**<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the worst thing anyone can do is to discourage a goal, no matter how <br/>\nunrealizable it seems.  If someone really wants something, regardless of the <br/>\napparent obstacles in front of them, they&#39;ll find a way to get to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n**What about hsing but w/structure instead of unschooling?**<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t necessarily mean no structure.  It means no <br/>\nparent-imposed structure.  If a child decides he&#39;d like to use a textbook or <br/>\ntake a community college class or a class online to learn something, then <br/>\nthat&#39;s unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is scary because we think we know so much more than our kids and <br/>\nwe can see the path they need to take to reach their goal so much clearer.  <br/>\nBut our superior knowledge can put blinders on kids so that they become so <br/>\nfocused on taking the path they say they want that we&#39;ve then laid out for <br/>\nthem, that they miss some fascinating side paths that would have lead them in <br/>\na direction neither of you could have foreseen.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"MOX","from":"&quot;MOX&quot; &lt;mox@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"TtMPYgL9b7Rg7DFXP3cy1r1pPwQw94tlIXAiRd65OdxXKgRJUx6BcGWz1oi_pCfXOc1hygMO9AzjXti_nhGF","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"to be a dr.-advice please","postDate":"930468310","msgId":1270,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy45Ni4xMjcwLjk1OTI2OTc0MEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1272,"prevInTime":1269,"nextInTime":1271,"topicId":1270,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone!
