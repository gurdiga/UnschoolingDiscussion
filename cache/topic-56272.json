It&#39;s waaay past my bedtime, but I <br/>\nfelt I had to write.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems that when we write about children&#39;s rights, it&#39;s (sometimes) coming <br/>\nacross that the parent has NO rights. That we when we say no bedtimes, that <br/>\npeople think we mean the children are swinging from the chandeliers until all <br/>\nhours. That when we say that kids can eat what and when they want, that they <br/>\neat ice cream and M&Ms all day. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s NOT how it IS. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your household has been restrictive and you suddenly &quot;let go&quot;---YES, <br/>\nthings may go a little wild. But it&#39;s really not that black and white.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf dad needs to go to bed early because he must be UP early, EVERYONE in the <br/>\nfamily MUST respect that. Why WOULDN&#39;T a child respect and understand that? <br/>\nIt&#39;s NECESSARY for dad&#39;s well-being (and to keep that paycheck rolling in! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n). There don&#39;t need to be a million rules, just-----what&#39;s the word???? (I&#39;m <br/>\ntired, forgive me!)<br/>\n<br/>\nShowing children respect does NOT mean that they show NONE to the parents. <br/>\nIt&#39;s MUTUAL respect. EVERYone&#39;s needs must be met. It&#39;s not the OPPOSITE of <br/>\nthe top-down family . Ummmm--OK---It&#39;s like the opposite of school is NOT <br/>\nhomeschooling. That is replicating school at home. The OPPOSITE of school is <br/>\nUNschooling where we don&#39;t DO school---or anything that resembles it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe opposite of the topdown family is not that the children &quot;run the show&quot;. <br/>\nIt&#39;s an equal partnership. We ALL work together. If dad needs relative quiet <br/>\nin the house after 10:00pm, everyone should try to respect that. It&#39;s UNFAIR <br/>\nto dad for the kids to be monkeys.  JUST as it&#39;s unfair to set arbitrary <br/>\nlimits &quot;because I&#39;m the dad&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould someone elaborate?
