To me that means having a supply of non-perishable food, solar or wood cookers, alternative heat source for those of us living in the areas where winter without heat could prove fatal, clothing, basic medical supplies, cleaning supplies, seeds to plant for food crops, fruit trees in the yard [or on the balcony for apartment dwellers] etc make sense for lots of reasons, not just the Y2K and such.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeak oil is a fact, we have used about half of the world&#39;s fuel reserves, and it costs more and uses more and more fuel to extract the remainder of the fuel.  We are using fuel at a faster rate than any other time in history and we don&#39;t look like slowing down any time soon, here in the USA we carry on about gas prices instead of limiting our use of it to ensure that at least essential services will have fuel in 10 to 20 years time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife could be about to change quite drasticly, but for some reason the powers that be are ignoring the facts, big oil companies are in denial, auto manafacturers are making bigger gas guzzlers than ever before [Hummers come to mind] and here in the States fuel has been ridiculously inexpensive for too long, almost everywhere else in the world people pay a lot more for fuel than we do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor once I agree with GWB, dipping into the nations emergency fuel supply is not the thing to do.   If the worse case scenarios occur it will make the depression of the 30s look like a picnic.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of things we can all do are:  Buy locally produced items, and locally grown food where possible, even if it costs a little more it will keep the local producers in business for when we need them.   Cut back as much as possible oy our use of all fossil fuels, it will save some for later as we learn how to get by with less for when there is none.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people I have discussed this with are full of optomism and believe that there will be plenty of alternative fuel sources by then, I&#39;m not, I&#39;ve seen the waste of funds:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are presently trying to generate power using a large wood gasifier which we are designing with help from &quot;experts&quot;... there are grants and &quot;experts&quot; in abundance, but the &quot;experts&quot; mainly do feasablity studies and little else, we had one graduate student &quot;research&quot; our options and was paid $5000 for doing what we had already done, look on the internet, speak to the self <br/>\nproclaimed &quot;experts&quot; and at his presentation, say in summing up &quot;It&#39;s beyond me.&quot;... yet he still got his $5000.  What he had been asked to do was get a small prototype up and running, and all he did was give us a presentation that I could have put together in a few days.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThen another expert, says &quot;If you invest $100,000, the power you generate would pay it back in five years, my charge os $200 per hour to design the system, but there are no guarantees.&quot;, the next &quot;expert&quot; comes up with a fancy looking design &quot;That will be $12,000 thanks.&quot; and after talking to people who have been experimenting with these things we realise that his whole design is worse than useless.   There are millions of your tax dollars paying these people to play on the internet and make fancy/useless designs, that even we amateurs can blow away with the logic we have from years of burning wood. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we talk to these people some immediatley say &quot;I charge $100/$200 per hour, send money and I&#39;ll talk.&quot; or they seem right friendly and almost neighborly, say that they would like to help with such a worthy venture, talk on the phone for an hour at a time, email back and forth, <br/>\nthen bait the hook with &quot;I think it might just work, I charge $250 an hour.&quot;    There is too much money spent on thinking, drawing, researching with nothing to show but a presentation, or if we had gone ahead with the last design that had all the bells and whistles and technology that made it look good, but was destined to fail within a few months due to a glass like substance that forms when you burn wood with a lot of dirt in it.  The expert would have his money, the small government grant would have paid him and we would have been stuck with a <br/>\ndebt and a destroyed gasifier....  my husband is still obcessed with getting this to work as a way to hanlde large pieces of wood dropped here by the dump truck load.   They are too big to grind and too big to break down very rapidly... my suggestion is to stop taking them, but <br/>\nthen he is concerned about the waste of their potential energy output for cheap fuel...   anyway, onto the email that I am forwarding:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  The author said:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d remove my email addy, but otherwise, yes, <br/>\nplease, pass it on.  This is important stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, _it is really important to keep perspective_ - some of those <br/>\nlinks are to very scary, semi-apocalyptic scenarios, which I hope are <br/>\nunlikely.  To me, things aren&#39;t so bleak - if everyone, and I mean <br/>\neveryone, gets on the same page and starts working together.  I&#39;m pretty <br/>\nsure we can&#39;t all go on living the way we do, but if we start covering <br/>\nthose suburban lawns, central park, industrial parks, the white house <br/>\nlawn, with small scale grazing animals and victory gardens, we can soften <br/>\nthe blow a lot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are sending this to kids, please add this - _being scared is <br/>\nappropriate_ - I&#39;m scared.  _Feeling that things are futile is another thing <br/>\n- this should be a call to action,_ and not just personal action, but the <br/>\ncollective.  Those of us with land and skills and tools will have the <br/>\noppotunity to help others use what they have.  I feel like the 13th fairy <br/>\nin the sleeping beauty legend - after the curse has been laid, you can&#39;t <br/>\ntake it away, but you can keep the story going and the wolf (mixing my <br/>\nfairy tales) from the door with the right action.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;  how soon do the best estimates state that the oil will be gone?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a harder question than it sounds, since the problem is not running <br/>\nout of oil per se, but failing to meet production and using more energy to <br/>\nextract it than we actually get from the oil.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe textbook my husband teaches from bets around 10 years from now, give <br/>\nor take 5 years.  I&#39;ve seen estimates that go as far as 2030, but I don&#39;t <br/>\nfind them credible - most are based on consumption lowering or staying the <br/>\nsame, whereas it is actually rising quite rapidly.  Since nearly everyone <br/>\nwho has oil lies about how much they have to ensure that people will keep <br/>\nbuying from them, its hard to tell.  Even the most optimistic outlook <br/>\nmeans that we&#39;ll run out of oil in about 25 years - but I don&#39;t think <br/>\nthere&#39;s any reason to be optimistic.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess is we&#39;ll see oil rationing in the US within the next 10 years.  <br/>\nIt is possible we&#39;ve already passed peak (ie, the point at which oil stops <br/>\nmeeting need) and our rising gas and oil prices are a sign of that.  It is <br/>\nalso possible that the Saudis will release more oil and temporarily lower <br/>\nprices.  But it will be a temporary lowering<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big problem is *food* - the average American meal travels more than <br/>\n1000 miles to get there.  We&#39;ve centralized food production - much of the <br/>\nproduce comes from CA, the wheat and beef from the west, the corn from the <br/>\nmidwest.  All commercial agriculture uses between 5 and 40 calories of oil <br/>\nto produce every calorie of food - in pesticides, in transport, as <br/>\nfertilizer, to store it, etc...  We&#39;re seeing inflation in basic <br/>\ncommoditities now - that bag of flour is going to go up a lot in price <br/>\nwhen gas hits 5, 6, 7 dollars per gallon.  And eventually it may become <br/>\nunavailable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, without oil, there&#39;s no evidence that we can feed the 6-9 <br/>\nbillion people who will be on the planet when the crash comes.  We&#39;ve <br/>\ngrown above our capacity to sustain ourselves.  If everyone went right now <br/>\nto John Jeavonsesque diets (he suggests that an entire balanced diet for a <br/>\nhuman being can be grown on about 1000 square feet, but there&#39;s not a lot <br/>\nof fat in it, and you eat a *lot* of parsnips) maybe.  But since food <br/>\nproduction is about to become local - very, very, very local, famine <br/>\nprobably will be too - there&#39;s no way, for example, to feed most of the <br/>\nmajor cities, since there&#39;s simply no farmland left nearby.  The west, <br/>\nwhich depends on energy-intensive irrigation and water diversion from <br/>\ndepleted aquifers and rivers, probably will not be able to sustain the <br/>\npopulation it has now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, whether it happens in 10 years or 25, our children are <br/>\nlooking at a future that is much darker than our own - at the best <br/>\neconomically depressed, at the worst, starving.  I don&#39;t want to sound <br/>\nlike the Raven, croaking &quot;Nevermore&quot; but the reason I keep singing this <br/>\ntune is because I don&#39;t want anyone on this list to be unprepared.  Most <br/>\nof us are lucky enough never to have heard a child say, &#39;Mommy, I&#39;m <br/>\nhungry.&quot; and have to answer, &quot;There&#39;s nothing to eat.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve included some references at the bottom of the page.  There are a lot <br/>\nof them, so I hope it isn&#39;t overwhelming, but I want to be totally clear <br/>\nthat I&#39;m not the only one who believe this - in fact, this may be the only <br/>\nthing on earth on which Michael Moore and Bush&#39;s Energy Czar agree on, <br/>\nbelieve it or not.  My personal suggestions:<br/>\n<br/>\nGet the heck out of the cities/suburbia before it becomes obvious and the <br/>\nprice of rural land goes up.  In the short term, as gas prices rise, I <br/>\nsuspect it will go down, but don&#39;t wait to see if I&#39;m right.  There are <br/>\nparts of the country where land is very cheap.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk to your family and friends about this - consider land-sharing, <br/>\ncommunity building, anything.  No one can do everything alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nInvest in tools for off-grid living - woodstoves, water pumps, etc... <br/>\nSolar/hydro/wind is a good idea, although expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nStore food and grow food - the one upside of this is that you can expect <br/>\nrealistically to find homesteading a lot more profitable - maybe even <br/>\nself-supporting in the long term.  But remember, times will probably be <br/>\nhard for a while, and it takes a good while to learn to grow enough food, <br/>\nsave seed and produce your own grains/animal feeds.  You are going to want <br/>\na bigger garden, and a lot of reserves - extra food, extra seeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t expect to rely on hunting - there&#39;s going to be a lot of competition <br/>\nthere, and during the depression, large game was hunted almost to <br/>\nextinction in places.  There are a lot more people now and they have <br/>\nbetter guns.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrepare your kids for a different world - teach them practical skills, and <br/>\ntry and have something to pass down to them - the ancestral home may <br/>\nbecome a lot more attractive.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry and be as healthy as possible - medications are going to get more <br/>\nunaffordable or unavailable.  Find natural remedies, learn to reproduce <br/>\nthem, and take good care of yourself now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some references - you might also look at this month&#39;s National <br/>\nGeographic, where &quot;The End of Cheap Oil&quot; is the cover story, and watch the <br/>\nrecently released on DVD documentary _The End of Suburbia_<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.oilcrash.com<br/>\nwww.oilcrisis.org, www.hubbertpeak.com The Hubbert Peak of Oil Production <br/>\n- is the place to go for references.
