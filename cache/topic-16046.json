I&#39;ve tried to teach my children to exercise good judgment <br/>\nabout such things, and to recognize that choosing to lie is a serious choice. <br/>\nI don&#39;t make distinctions like white lies. A lie is the telling of an untruth <br/>\nor the omission of the truth as a means of misleading someone. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, there are ways to get away from the gun without lying, and I would like <br/>\nthem to do that if possible, but sometimes kids don&#39;t let each other have an <br/>\neasy out, and a gun in a kid&#39;s hands can be a matter of life and death. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want them to get caught up in a debate over who&#39;s a chicken when <br/>\nsomeone is twirling a lethal weapon around.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a rapist had just assaulted me and asked me if there were any other <br/>\nfemales in the house, I wouldn&#39;t feel moved to reveal my daughter&#39;s presence. <br/>\nIt&#39;s an extreme example, but it&#39;s the kind I use with my kids because I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant them to think everyone and every situation is deserving of the truth. <br/>\nWe&#39;ve talked over lots of examples and discussed how you can be tactful <br/>\nwithout lying when the situation warrants it, as well.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\ncandice<br/>\n~~~~~~<br/>\nMás vale morir parado<br/>\nque vivir de rodillas.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16409,"nextTopicId":16410}}
