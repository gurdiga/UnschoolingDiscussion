My husband <br/>\njust lent a compassionate ear, but afterwards we discussed how <br/>\nextremely difficult it would be to have so many children in public <br/>\nschool at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a neighbor that has a 9yo, 3yo and 1-1/2 yo triplets and <br/>\nshe has been asking me to pass along homeschooling info to her <br/>\nbecause, just having the one in school right now and all the homework <br/>\nand expectations, she can&#39;t even imagine what it would be like when <br/>\nthey all go.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and an observation from last night about perspectives:  A friend <br/>\nwas complaining about her morning routine with her three children <br/>\nbefore going to school daily - they all have to wake up at 6am, have <br/>\nbreakfast, groom, etc., and it&#39;s a daily struggle.  I made a comment <br/>\nabout how there are many mornings in my house that by say, 10am, I <br/>\nhave to convince my children to eat breakfast and they complain about <br/>\nthat (having to put down what they are doing at the time) and I have <br/>\npointed out to them how different our schedule and morning complaints <br/>\nwould be if they were in school.  My friend said, &quot;Well, welcome to <br/>\nthe REAL WORLD!  What are they going to do when they HAVE to get up <br/>\nvery early?&quot;  I just replied, &quot;I live in the REAL WORLD, and my life <br/>\nis what and how I&#39;ve made it.&quot;  It&#39;s all a matter of what we see the <br/>\nREAL WORLD as.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and power to you in all of the decision you&#39;ll have to make <br/>\nfor your boys with homeschooling/unschooling and beyond!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., GeorganneD@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I have triplet boys just under 3 and I hope to unschool them.
