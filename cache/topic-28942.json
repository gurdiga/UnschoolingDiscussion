So any speculations about whether he wore glasses or had a<br/>\nvision problem seem to me slightly beside the point.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone else on this list said not long ago that the body and the mind are<br/>\none, in the sense that, for example, stress is both an emotional and a<br/>\nphysical phenomenon (you feel stress, stress hormones circulate, muscles<br/>\ntense, you feel more stressed, etc.) Eyesight is one of those things that<br/>\nseem to be especially vulnerable to stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got my first pair of glasses at age eleven (though, looking back, I had<br/>\nprobably needed them long before that). At first I wore them only to see the<br/>\nblackboard or a movie screen, then also for the TV, and eventually at all<br/>\ntimes. In my twenties, I tried to get rid of them after reading a book<br/>\ncalled Better Vision Without Glasses (or Better Eyesight  Im not sure<br/>\nof the title).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea behind the book, as I remember it (I may have some of this mixed up<br/>\nby now) is that myopia (nearsightedness) is not due to a permanent<br/>\ncongenital defect consisting of an abnormally elongated eyeball (which<br/>\ncauses the image to fall short of the retina), as optometrists would have<br/>\nyou believe, but to an incorrect use of the muscles that support the<br/>\neyeball, which can temporarily change its shape.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book explained that myopia is caused by staring  by not taking in the<br/>\nwhole scene through very rapid, fluid movements of the eyes in and out of<br/>\nthe distance while blinking frequently, but instead fixating on a single<br/>\npoint and straining to see it without much blinking at all. There were<br/>\nexercises that supposedly could help you get rid of your glasses even after<br/>\nyears of using them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried the exercises, but they made my eyes hurt. So I ditched them and<br/>\njust started to take my glasses off unless I really needed them. (I really<br/>\nneeded them a lot  I would take them off and proceed down the sidewalk,<br/>\nthen put them back on to cross it.) After some days or weeks of this (I don<br/>\nt remember which) I found myself able to read the name of the Metro station<br/>\non the wall (this was in Madrid) from inside the train.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, I became able to read a street sign from across the street. I was<br/>\nabsolutely amazed. It was inconvenient to be using my glasses so sparingly,<br/>\nthough, so sometime later I gave up on the experiment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIm explaining all this because I think it means that vision is not<br/>\nstatic, and that a vision problem is not necessarily something that just<br/>\nhappens to you for some inexplicable genetically-based reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Never Too Late, John also talks about how, when stress hormones<br/>\ncirculate, peripheral vision becomes limited. This seems to make sense  we<br/>\nmay have evolved to focus (literally) on the most urgent problem right in<br/>\nfront of us, and not waste brain cell power worrying about things off to<br/>\neither side.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know how, when youre about to be run over by a truck (or whatever) time<br/>\nfreezes and you zero in on some tiny, insignificant detail? Well, if you<br/>\nfeel threatened by the printed page and your field of vision becomes<br/>\nseverely constricted, you might start reading letter-by-letter instead of<br/>\nmaking relaxed use of the surrounding text. (The eyes of fluent readers dart<br/>\nall over the page as they read  I know mine do.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a purely physical problem, to be solved by glasses? Maybe not. Would<br/>\nan optometrist be able to diagnose a vision problem in your daughter? Maybe<br/>\nits like the way its hard for doctors to get blood pressure readings that<br/>\nmean much of anything, because a lot of peoples blood pressures shoot up on<br/>\nany visit to the doctors office, and because blood pressure varies<br/>\naccording to the time of day, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHard to test or correct - maybe only treatable through stress reduction.<br/>\nBiofeedback? Soothing music? Or just not having your daughter participate in<br/>\nany reading aloud, or in anything else that puts her under stress about her<br/>\nreading ability?<br/>\n<br/>\nI mentioned in a previous post the enormous difference between a word game<br/>\nin which the student is reading aloud words the teacher puts together from<br/>\nletter cards, and one in which the student puts together the words, be they<br/>\npronounceable or not, and the teacher has to try to read them, amid laughter<br/>\n(zzftlqt, bnxtuvsql).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the former case, the student is under pressure, whether you keep score,<br/>\nor give a grade, or call it a game, or not. In the second case, there is<br/>\nno pressure  only the opportunity for the student to make his or her own<br/>\ndiscoveries  since the teacher has no way of evaluating what the student<br/>\nknows or is learning at any given point in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont know. I do think its significant that your daughter told you she<br/>\nsees the words melting off the page or dripping down.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry reading Never Too Late. You could also read the part in George Dennison<br/>\ns The Lives Of Children where he describes the physical contortions<br/>\n(squirming, sighing, cringing, etc.) of the twelve-year-old student, Jose,<br/>\nas he tries to read aloud. (John Holt wrote a review of this book that<br/>\nemphasizes Joses evident agony  I think its in Sharing Treasures, the<br/>\ncollection of his book reviews.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(P.S.- The word you wanted is astigmatism, all one word. I think that<br/>\nvision book has something to say about it, too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nElsa Haas<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sarah Carothers [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, November 30, 2001 9:44 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Holt and LD<br/>\n<br/>\nElsa wrote:<br/>\n&lt;He describes the notes jumping around on the score, and then says something<br/>\nlike, &quot;It wasn&#39;t just that I couldn&#39;t read the notes.

Don’t know how available that book is now. Pat Farenga (at Holt Assoc.) told","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1229452949\">Im pretty sure theres an entire chapter on LDs in Teach Your Own. Dont<br/>\nknow how available that book is now. Pat Farenga (at Holt Assoc.) told me<br/>\nrecently that hes got a contract to revise the book for a new edition<br/>\n(because so much of the legal info is way out of date).<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn also writes about LDs in Never Too Late, which was his book about<br/>\nlearning to play the cello late in life (around 50?). He describes a<br/>\nsituation in which he was under a lot of stress during a music lesson and<br/>\nsuddenly experienced what was once called word blindness (and later called<br/>\ndyslexia), only with notes instead of words.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe describes the notes jumping around on the score, and then says something<br/>\nlike, It wasnt just that I couldnt read the notes. It was as if I had<br/>\nnever seen such a thing as a note ever before in my life, and could make no<br/>\nsense of their purpose or place in the world in any way. (Im very much<br/>\nparaphrasing here, but thats the spirit of it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe then says that he imagines that reading, for a person for whom it is<br/>\ndifficult, must be like that awful sensation, when youre under stress, in<br/>\nwhich you keep looking up a phone number again and again in the space of<br/>\nseconds, unsure youll be able to dial it from memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nIve just looked in the index of Learning All the Time and found a couple of<br/>\nshort references to LDs. One reads, in part, Some years ago, at a large<br/>\nconference of specialists in learning disability, I asked whether anyone had<br/>\never heard of  not done, but merely heard of  any research linking<br/>\nso-called perceptual handicaps with stress. In the audience of about 1,100,<br/>\ntwo hands were raised. One man told me then, the other told me later, about<br/>\nresearch that showed that when students with supposedly severe learning<br/>\ndisabilities were put in a relatively stress-free situation, their<br/>\ndisabilities soon vanished. (No, he doesnt give any citation for the<br/>\nresearch, at least not in this passage.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago, Holt Assoc. published a booklet titled Everyone Is Able. I was<br/>\none of the contributors  I wrote about how I didnt learn to tell time<br/>\nuntil I was 12. I was a straight-A student almost every year, all the way<br/>\nthrough school. I just couldnt tell time, and I was so ashamed I went<br/>\nthrough all sorts of contortions (described in the booklet) to keep anyone<br/>\nfrom finding out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts kind of spoiling the punchline to tell you what happened in the end,<br/>\nbut Ill tell you anyway since I dont even know whether the booklet is<br/>\nstill available: I finally figured out, after somehow learning on my own how<br/>\nto tell time, that the problem must have stemmed from the cardboard clock my<br/>\nfirst-grade teacher had used to teach us. Back then, I had told time with<br/>\nthe best of them. Well, guess what? She must have been putting the hour hand<br/>\nprecisely on top of the number, instead of somewhere between two numbers. On<br/>\na real clock my problem was how to figure out whether it was 1:20 or 2:20,<br/>\nfor example.<br/>\n<br/>\nIm just telling you about this because, while I may believe a little more<br/>\nthan John did that there are some people with some microscopic glitch in the<br/>\nbrain that makes learning to read (or whatever) difficult, I agree with him<br/>\nthat there are nowhere near as many real cases of this as the schools would<br/>\nhave us believe. Part of the overdiagnosing has to do with there being more<br/>\nFederal funding for disabled students. Part of it is the schools<br/>\ninsistence on seeing intellectual endeavor as something that is completely<br/>\ndevoid of emotions, and on rarely looking at the teaching from the point of<br/>\nview of the students. Stress, bad teaching materials, etc. arent even<br/>\nlooked into as a possibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think John might also have come around to thinking that glitches did<br/>\nsometimes exist if hed been around for all the studies about victims of<br/>\nstroke or head injury losing extremely specific abilities, like the use of<br/>\nverbs or of nouns. (Oliver Sachs book The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A<br/>\nHat comes to mind.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I still think the place to start in any individual case is with stress,<br/>\nboth because its more likely to be that and because we dont yet know what<br/>\nto do about the physical glitches.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf theres an 11-year-old whos obviously upset about her lack of reading<br/>\nability, and shes coming to her mother every night with a book and getting<br/>\neven more upset about the fact that, after reading it aloud successfully,<br/>\nshes turning it over and finding that its way below her grade level,<br/>\nthen (given that there doesnt seem to be an operation or a pill, or even a<br/>\nparticularly effective teaching technique for dyslexics) the focus should<br/>\nprobably be on reducing the level of stress shes feeling. She isnt going<br/>\nto learn ANYTHING useful in that state.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to reduce the stress, I dont know, but it does occur to me that there<br/>\nis one section in the library where none of the books are labelled as to<br/>\ngrade level  the adult section. How about telling her youd rather read<br/>\naloud to her than listen to her read? Absolutely no stress. She curls up and<br/>\nlooks at the page (or not) as you read, and she picks up, in time, something<br/>\nmore about reading than she would by struggling syllable by syllable through<br/>\na book meant for first graders.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never understood the point of having beginning readers read aloud, anyway.<br/>\nThe non-fluent readers in my school were always the ones who, when asked to<br/>\nread silently at their desks, could be observed moving their lips. I think<br/>\nsilent reading comes first, and only once its fluent, should the reader<br/>\nread aloud.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you already read aloud to your daughter, Sarah, or if shes vehemently<br/>\ninsisting on reading aloud, just disregard this. I do think its sometimes<br/>\nhelpful to bring in someone from outside the family to help, but not if that<br/>\nwill just add to the stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow Children Fail is, in a way, entirely about LDs. Look for the part<br/>\nabout how John refrained from putting together words (from letter cards<br/>\nmeant to teach reading) for the kids he was tutoring to read to him.<br/>\nInstead, he asked them to put together words for HIM to read  which<br/>\nresulted in a lot of words that were hard for him to pronounce (like<br/>\nzzftkql), and a lot of laughter, and gave the kids complete freedom from<br/>\nmaking mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother, at 37, has recently been DELIGHTED to be diagnosed as ADD.<br/>\nHah. But thats another story.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the long sentences.
