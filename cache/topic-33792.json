Here&#39;s the Snopes article.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrigins:   In mid-March 2002, those who had been availing themselves of <br/>\nYahoo!&#39;s free<br/>\n        POP mail service received a shock in their inboxes, an announcement <br/>\nfrom the<br/>\n        company that as of 24 April 2002 those previously-free services <br/>\nwould continue to be<br/>\n        available only to those willing to pay for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Beginning April 24, Yahoo! will charge $29.99 a year for this <br/>\nfeature. Those who sign up<br/>\n        before that date can secure continuation of this service for $19.99 <br/>\nper annum. Before<br/>\n        anyone becomes overly confused on this point, remember that we&#39;re <br/>\ntalking strictly<br/>\n        about POP (Post Office Protocol) e-mail accounts (a protocol that <br/>\nallows desktop e-mail<br/>\n        clients such as Eudora and Microsoft Outlook to download mail <br/>\nmessages from host<br/>\n        systems to users&#39; PCs ). Non-POP e-mail accounts -- those accessed <br/>\nby reading e-mail<br/>\n        from Yahoo! via a web browser -- will still be free.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\nEleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1694471,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","profile":"anoydami","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Attention Lurkers and Digest Readers","postDate":"1017273310","msgId":33792,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxZDUwMWMxZDVlZSQ2OTY3NjEwMCQzMDVkZDFkMUBjb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":33793,"prevInTime":33791,"nextInTime":33793,"topicId":33792,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"O.K., the question is, how many folks are going to anti-up the intro $20 to get their mail from this list sent to their Outlook Express or whatever Pop3 server","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1715910771\">O.K., the question is, how many folks are going to anti-up the intro $20 to<br/>\nget their mail from this list sent to their Outlook Express or whatever Pop3<br/>\nserver and how many that aren&#39;t on web read are going to go to web read?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd before you answer, go and try the VERY SLLLOOOWWWWWW loaded with ads web<br/>\nsite and try reading the mail.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr how many are just going to drop the list and forget it?
