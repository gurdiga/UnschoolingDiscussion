It didn&#39;t even cross my mind that we <br/>\nwere out during school hours, because it&#39;s not an issue to me.  I got a good <br/>\n(self-righteous?) chuckle over the grandmotherly types that were there making <br/>\ntheir fabric purchases.  They knew it was school hours and here I was in a <br/>\nstore with a perfectly healthy looking 12 yr old boy!  Gasp!  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I figured out why everyone was looking at us, I had no trouble ignoring <br/>\nthem.  Eventually, while we were looking at patterns with said 12 yr old boy, <br/>\none of the grandma-types started leaning across the table and talking with <br/>\nus.  No one actually asked why we were there at that hour (okay by me), but <br/>\nshe was one of the women that looked shocked when we walked in.  She was <br/>\nprobably even more startled as we were talking about patterns because the <br/>\nreason for our visit was to choose ds first sewing project.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was great.  I know you can all relate.  It&#39;s just my first school hours <br/>\n&#39;exposure&#39; of the year (one car family and dh works out of town, I get out <br/>\nwhen I can get a ride, so it took longer this year).  I always forget it may <br/>\nbe an &#39;issue&#39; for others.  We go out anyway and don&#39;t let the public school <br/>\nschedule determine our plans.<br/>\n<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13073,"nextTopicId":13156}}
