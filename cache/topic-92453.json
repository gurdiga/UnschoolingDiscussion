Recently, a reporter <br/>\nfrom our newspaper interviewed myself and another unschooling mom for <br/>\nan article on unschooling. It ran on the front page of the <br/>\nSunday paper today, which surprised me a bit, and spanned 3 pages. I <br/>\nthought it would be buried somewhere in the educational beat. <br/>\nOverall, I&#39;m pretty pleased with the way the article turned out, <br/>\nespecially considering some of the recent nationwide press concerning <br/>\nhomeschooling. The woman who wrote it took several different <br/>\noccasions to interview us and the kids, plus sent out a photographer <br/>\nfor an afternoon. That was the tough part - how do you photograph <br/>\nunschooling?
