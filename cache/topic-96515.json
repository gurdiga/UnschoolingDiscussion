We&#39;ve been Rocky Horror fans at my house for <br/>\nyears and I have the tape.  When I found out that it was playing at <br/>\na theater close enough to go, Erica who was 13 at the time and I <br/>\nwent.  The theater we went to wasn&#39;t as risque as the ones Kathryn <br/>\nand Sandra went to, but it was the original, uncut movie.  You could <br/>\nsee lots of body and pubic hair on Frankenfurter and on the one I <br/>\nhave at home you can&#39;t.  It was airbrushed out.  The scene with <br/>\nFrankie and Janet in bed, then Frankie and Brad was cut short in the <br/>\nhome version, too.  It is still there, but it moves so quickly to <br/>\nthe next scene that you don&#39;t think about it much.  It was a cool <br/>\nexperience seeing it in a theater, but I think we&#39;ll wait until <br/>\nErica&#39;s older to see it there again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] OT -- Scripture and tragedy","postDate":"1090287673","msgId":96539,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlOC4yNThjZTc0My4yZTJkZDIzOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":96533,"nextInTopic":96542,"prevInTime":96538,"nextInTime":96540,"topicId":96515,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/19/2004 7:07:28 PM Eastern Daylight Time, hayes@metrocast.net writes: My aunt  was killed yesterday in a motorcycle  accident.
