When my mother died, we had a memorial service that allowed us all to remember her with her presence there.  We sprayed her perfume in the chapel, placed pots of Gardenias, her favorite flowers, everywhere, and then later planted them in her yard.  The immediate members of her family and a few of her closest friends read poems that she loved or that reminded us of her.  At the end we sang &quot;To Life&quot; from Fiddler on the Roof and all toasted her with champagne.  I remember my little step brothers (who were only six) climbing all over the largest, coolest sculptures (actually headstones) while we were outside having our toast to her. I was 26. This was years before I had my own children.  It was my first huge hit of how children completely bring you into the moment, into life, the living.  May you have a warm day of memories and of loving each other.  I know there are no right words to say to you. You sharing your experience on her last day/night really moved me alot.  I ended up dancing with my three year old to a new song by Train about a guardian angel. Take care of yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Madeline<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety<br/>\ndeserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;  Ben Franklin<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

That was so familiar it called her back briefly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had decided to move her to a nursing home that day since we had agreed<br/>\non only comfort care.  When she got to the nursing home, her eyes opened and<br/>\nstayed open.  She had such a look of fear and confusion.  I hadn&#39;t planned<br/>\non staying overnight, but I just couldn&#39;t leave her like that.  They brought<br/>\nin a big recliner for me to sleep on, and I spent the night mostly holding<br/>\nher hand.
