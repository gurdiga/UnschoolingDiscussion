If he&#39;s upset and doesn&#39;t want to play because of this <br/>\nkid&#39;s harrassment, then you need approach the coach.  Where I grew <br/>\nup, there were lots of different opportunities for playing soccer, so <br/>\nI could switch teams if I wanted.  I did switch drop down to a lower <br/>\nskilled team one year due to not getting along with the coach.  I was <br/>\nhappier, which is what&#39;s important.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son is the type to blow off the other kid&#39;s comments or to <br/>\nstand up and tell him off, then no worries.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, what would you have said to the coach in response to <br/>\n&gt; the &quot;he&#39;ll get used to it- this will be great socialization&quot; <br/>\n&gt; comment?

I would talk with your son about what he <br/>\nwants you to do, if anything.  He will encounter bullies throughout <br/>\nlife.  My typical reaction to someone who is screaming for the ball <br/>\nis to ignore them and find someone else for a pass :).

He attended a week of <br/>\nsoccer camp over the summer, and is now starting practices for a <br/>\ntravelling soccer team that he&#39;ll be playing with this fall.<br/>\nThis is all his choice, and he&#39;s learning a lot about the game and <br/>\nhaving a great time, but he needs some help dealing with name <br/>\ncalling and other things which he&#39;s not all that accustomed to.<br/>\nAt the first practice there was one boy in particular who would <br/>\nshout things at my son like &quot;PASS THE BALL YOU IDIOT!!&quot;  <br/>\nTonight at practice I hung out for a little while, and when the <br/>\ncoach asked me how my son was doing I said he was doing great except <br/>\nfor being a little upset at being called an idiot by this other <br/>\nboy.  What I was hoping for (and half-expecting since I&#39;m usually <br/>\nnot around people who think name calling is okay) is that the coach <br/>\nwould be duly concerned and mabye even have a pep talk for the boys <br/>\nabout being a team/no name calling/all for one and one for all- that <br/>\nsort of thing.  Instead he gave me a knowing smile and said, almost <br/>\naffectionately &quot;I think I know the boy you&#39;re talking about.

He&#39;ll get used <br/>\nto it.  This will be excellent socialization for him.&quot;<br/>\nWhich made me angry I even brought it up to him because now I feel <br/>\nlike my son is perceived as an oversheltered, oversensitive kid who <br/>\nneeds to be &quot;toughened up,&quot;  and I&#39;m perceived as an oversheltering, <br/>\noversensitive mother.
