I agree the primary sources and undigested exposure in <br/>\nsystematic schooling is much too late coming. Part of why we uschool, to avoid that <br/>\nconcern for my own children, so they will read and think voraciously without <br/>\ninterference or control.<br/>\n<br/>\n       But when you say &quot;every textbook manufacturer&quot; the point is realizing <br/>\nhow small a group that has become, and that any competition that remains <br/>\nbetween them is not of the beneficial kind (if it ever was.)   I recall one of the <br/>\npoints her book means to make is that only four conglomerates now control the <br/>\nentire textbook, curriculum AND (drum roll) testing market. It all spirals <br/>\ntogether tighter and tighter, so only a few business decision-makers really do <br/>\ncontrol the content the whole population of American children are mandated to <br/>\nmaster.  And if I remember right, three of those four aren&#39;t even American, but <br/>\nforeign owned -- so the issue was whether it&#39;s really anything like the free <br/>\nmarketplace of ideas we might want, or believe we have.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Standardized tests do affect people beyond public school, when they <br/>\nwant college admission or other advanced study or to enter the military, etc, and <br/>\ntesting also seems to determine how the general public thinks about what <br/>\n&quot;learning&quot; is and what it means to &quot;be educated.&quot; The folks that brought us the <br/>\nSAT folks now are considering entering the curriculum market, for example, to <br/>\neke more profit out of proprietary work they&#39;ve already done and branding <br/>\nthey&#39;ve already paid for, I guess. And many homeschoolers rely on schoolish <br/>\ncurriculum materials and test their children regularly. In some states those test <br/>\nscores actually decide whether home education (and/or unschooling) legally can <br/>\ncontinue!<br/>\n<br/>\n       Personally I think knowing more about all this can indeed help move <br/>\npeople to unschooling, and can help us explain why unschooling is important and <br/>\nvaluable. Not just for our own children but for society, which NEEDS people <br/>\nlike us who don&#39;t buy into the centralization and control of words and ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n       .<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sorry I thought it was wholly school-related, but as it&#39;s about textbooks <br/>\n&gt; it <br/>\n&gt; IS school related.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And how true is it?

She <br/>\nwanted Kiwi fruit.  OK that was fine, not her treat though cause it was <br/>\nfor the family.  I got captain crunchy berries, cause it was on sale, as <br/>\nmy treat, but I&#39;ll get one bowl probably cause the kids like it too.  <br/>\nShe wanted strawberries, or blueberries, but they were very expensive, <br/>\nso we spent about five minutes &quot;pounding them&quot; and the Janene decided <br/>\nshe&#39;s wait for them to be in season so she could get more for her <br/>\nmoney.  The pounding comment was cute.  As we were discussing the cost <br/>\nof the various berries, she wanted to weigh them so she said &quot;I&#39;ll just <br/>\npound these so we can figure out how much money they cost.&quot;  At one <br/>\npoint she picked out cocoa puffs for her treat.

There she found some cheese shaped in wild animal <br/>\nshapes.  We couldn&#39;t find a price and she decided to wait until we had a <br/>\nprice before deciding upon the cheese or the cocoa puffs.  At the check <br/>\nout counter she saw some ring suckers and seriously considered those as <br/>\nher treat.  We got the price for the cheese and she wavered back and <br/>\nforth until she decided to get--the cheese.  It&#39;s not the best cheese, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s cheese.  Everyone in line got a kick out of the child who <br/>\npicked cheese over chocolate cereal, and didn&#39;t get when I explained <br/>\nthat in her mind all food is equal. <br/>\n<br/>\nTHe &quot;Pound it&quot; comment really made me laugh though.  I had another ctts <br/>\nfrom a student today similar to that.  He was writing a paragraph and <br/>\nsaid that soccer was good because it was good excersize and you got to <br/>\n&quot;do a lot of verbs.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI read it and read it.  What did he mean.  I finially figured it out. <br/>\nVerbs are action words, and soccer is an active sport.  You get to be <br/>\nactive.  So I just suggested that instead of saying it like that, <br/>\ninstead he use specific verbs like run and kick. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever forget that though, never quite thought I&#39;d hear <br/>\nthe word verb used in quite that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164396504,"authorName":"Elizabeth Roberts","from":"Elizabeth Roberts &lt;mamabethuscg@...&gt;","profile":"mamabethuscg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] math manipulatives","postDate":"1068135647","msgId":84003,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMxMTA2MTYyMDQ3LjM3NzMzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEyNjA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMGQwMWMzYTQ0NiQzMWNhM2ZiMCQwMjAwYThjMEBMQUM+"},"prevInTopic":83958,"nextInTopic":84088,"prevInTime":84002,"nextInTime":84004,"topicId":31493,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for passing this along!
