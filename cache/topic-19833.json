Homeschooling does have its funny moments.  And <br/>\nHomeschooling Humor is the topic for an upcoming segment in NHEN&#39;s <br/>\nwebsite. I&#39;m gathering humor pieces for the HS Humor POV.  I have <br/>\nseveral that have crossed my screen over the years and have kept for <br/>\nposterity, but I know there&#39;s more out there - some of which hasn&#39;t <br/>\neven been written yet.  We&#39;re hoping this project will inspire <br/>\nhomeschool humorists and pundits across the country to share their <br/>\nwit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve collected any of the many homeschooling jokes that have <br/>\nflown through cyberspace over the years, please forward them to me at <br/>\n&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cmoxley@...\">cmoxley@...</a>&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cmoxley@...\">cmoxley@...</a>.  I will make every attempt <br/>\nto credit the original author of the joke or anecdote if that person <br/>\ncan be found.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you yourself have created a joke, humorous essay or anecdote that <br/>\nshows the lighter side of homeschooling, we&#39;d love to include it. <br/>\nAgain, just send to &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cmoxley@...\">cmoxley@...</a>&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cmoxley@...\">cmoxley@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJokes, limericks, anecdotes, essays . . . if it&#39;s funny, send it in!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo!  Once again . . .How many homeschoolers does it take to change a <br/>\nlight bulb?   (We&#39;d love to have MANY punch lines in answer to this!) <br/>\nAnd don&#39;t stop there . . . Why did the homeschooler cross the road? <br/>\nWhat do you get when you cross a homeschooler with an elephant?  What <br/>\ntime is it when a homeschooler sits on a fence?  Silly, creative, <br/>\nfunny . . .  your joke could end up on the pages of NHEN!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease forward this to your homeschooling friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cmoxley@...\">cmoxley@...</a>&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cmoxley@...\">cmoxley@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19829,"nextTopicId":19835}}
