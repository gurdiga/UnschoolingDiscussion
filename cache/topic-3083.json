If I don&#39;t put my thoughts down before<br/>\nI go to sleep, I&#39;ll forget by the next night, and I surely will forget by<br/>\nthe end of the week. (Old age is setting in!) I know some people only<br/>\nrecord activities once a week or less. The log is our chosen method of<br/>\nassessment, and I do have to provide something for the town in the spring.<br/>\nI don&#39;t log hours, just make notes of special activities. It doesn&#39;t take a<br/>\nlot of my time to do, and it helps me remember topics that my son may have<br/>\ntouched on, but wanted to come back to later. The bigger issue is time for<br/>\nme at the end of the day, not necessarily computer time. Sometimes this<br/>\ntime involves just looking at a book or watching TV.
