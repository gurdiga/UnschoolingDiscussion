He believed the other children were about 3 and 5. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fire began about 11 p.m. Sunday in the front of the house near<br/>\nMollys bedroom, Dorney said. Investigators believe the fire was<br/>\nelectrical, and arson wasnt suspected, he said. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolt, Dick and the two younger children escaped through a window in the<br/>\nback bedroom where they were sleeping, Dorney said. <br/>\n<br/>\nNearly two hours later, when firefighters and deputies arrived, the house<br/>\nwas gone, except for its tin roof and brick chimney, he said. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the two hours after the start of the fire, the family apparently tried<br/>\nto make a 911 call. Their phone was burned. The keys to their car and<br/>\npickup lay somewhere in the fire. The nearest neighbor lived more than a<br/>\nhalf-mile away, Dorney said. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey set off on foot  Holt in coveralls, Dick in a raincoat, and the two<br/>\nsurviving children in their underwear, Prosecuting Attorney David Gibbons<br/>\nsaid. A passing couple picked the family up and took them to Holts<br/>\nbrothers residence, Dorney said. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere they finally made a 911 call at 12:45 a.m. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolt and his brother, Henry Holt Jr., returned to the rubble and met<br/>\ndeputies as they arrived. Lloyd Holt told them his daughter was inside<br/>\nand he wasnt able to get her out, Dorney said. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeputies found Mollys skeletal remains under the bed frame. <br/>\n<br/>\nA metal link chain was looped around the frame and twice around her left<br/>\nankle, where two padlocks secured her, Deputy Coroner Ashley Davis said. <br/>\n<br/>\nDavis pronounced Molly dead at 2:39 a.m. He said she probably woke up and<br/>\ntried to crawl to the door but died of smoke inhalation. Very little of<br/>\nher body remained by the time he arrived, he said. &quot;Every time I think<br/>\nIve seen everything, you see something new. It just blows your mind,&quot;<br/>\nDavis said. &quot;You cant even imagine it.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nGibbons said he would likely charge the couple with manslaughter. He said<br/>\nit was no justification, but the girl &quot;may have been mentally challenged<br/>\nto some degree and may have had some behavioral problems.&quot; He didnt<br/>\nthink the chaining was a recent development. The girl may have received<br/>\nspecial schooling in Clarksville, Gibbons said. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoy Wilson, director of Forrester-Davis Center for the Developmentally<br/>\nDisabled in Clarksville, could not be reached for comment. Julie Munsell,<br/>\nspokesman for Department of Human Services, cited federal privacy laws<br/>\nwhen declining to reveal any health-related services Molly received. But<br/>\nshe said the department had assigned investigators to ensure the welfare<br/>\nof the surviving children. <br/>\n<br/>\nMolly hadnt attended school for three years, according to Clarksville<br/>\nSuperintendent Don Johnston. Johnston said Molly transferred to the<br/>\ndistrict in 1999 and completed first grade in 2000. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn August 2000, Dick filed paperwork allowing home schooling for her<br/>\ndaughter, Johnston said. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolt and Dick were being held Wednesday in the Johnson County jail in<br/>\nlieu of bond. The surviving children are with Holts brother, Dorney<br/>\nsaid. Holt and Dick are scheduled for arraignment in Circuit Court on<br/>\nJan. 15.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84715,"nextTopicId":84722}}
