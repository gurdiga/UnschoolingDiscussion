Of course, it is buyer<br/>\nbeware.  The first thing you need to find out is whether she needs a<br/>\nfull-size or a 3/4 size.  (most 10 year olds need a 3/4 -- though it is<br/>\neasier to get a pleasing sound out of the larger size.) On ebay, you&#39;ll<br/>\noften find Glaesel (the German Glaesels are the best) or Knilling 3/4<br/>\nsizes -- they aren&#39;t great, but they are dependable (and always<br/>\nresellable) and should cost between $100 and $200.  (Don&#39;t buy the<br/>\nPalatinos or Larks -- they look good, but the sound is awful).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter (now 11) has been playing since she was 2, and has bought<br/>\ninstruments at auctions which have turned out great -- if you go that<br/>\nroute, you have to assume that you&#39;ll need to take it to a violin shop<br/>\nto get it adjusted into best playing condition.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other advice (for what it is worth, and which goes in the opposite<br/>\ndirection), is spend some extra money and let her truly pick out the one<br/>\nshe wants (and have it checked out before buying.)  (On 3/4 sizes,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll be reselling it when she needs a full-size later anyway, so<br/>\nyou&#39;ll basically get your money back, and it&#39;s a lot cheaper than<br/>\nrenting.)  People often make the mistake of saddling beginners with<br/>\ninferior instruments because they are inexpensive, not recognizing that<br/>\nfor the beginner (especially given the technical hurdles of the violin<br/>\nin particular), getting a good sound early is what hooks them -- the pro<br/>\nor advanced amateur can get sound out of an inferior instrument, but the<br/>\nbeginner needs all the help she can get.<br/>\n<br/>\n(if you want, I&#39;ll e-mail you my book chapter on beginning music,<br/>\nincluding our experience with violins, just let me know if you can<br/>\naccept Word attachments -- don&#39;t want to clutter up the list.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nB & T Simpson wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;B & T Simpson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michigan@...\">michigan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; would anyone out there know where I can find a used violin for my 10<br/>\n&gt; yo she<br/>\n&gt; would like to play one and teach herself, she is going to pay with her<br/>\n&gt; own<br/>\n&gt; money  so I would like to find her a really good deal, it doesn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; to be<br/>\n&gt; a great one since she may or may not use it much!,  thank you in<br/>\n&gt; advance<br/>\n&gt; for any tips!<br/>\n&gt; Tanya Ohio<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"B & T Simpson","from":"&quot;B & T Simpson&quot; &lt;michigan@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ZKMZs0ukqgzXd-4HgqQTm1n8SspDSK9WMAul5H3Ryp3Z79oBXYp0rm_HLXkdbSbCKE7XwrxpxKV0G7WYOk1e10jbURacM6xmBmL1WA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: used violin?","postDate":"936458023","msgId":2533,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xODUuMjUzMy45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2535,"prevInTime":2532,"nextInTime":2534,"topicId":2533,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"would anyone out there know where I can find a used violin for my 10 yo she would like to play one and teach herself, she is going to pay with her own money","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-235403276\">would anyone out there know where I can find a used violin for my 10 yo she<br/>\nwould like to play one and teach herself, she is going to pay with her own<br/>\nmoney  so I would like to find her a really good deal, it doesn&#39;t have to be<br/>\na great one since she may or may not use it much!,  thank you in advance<br/>\nfor any tips!<br/>\nTanya Ohio<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Thank you to anyone who has checked out or shopped at my oline mall!!!<br/>\n&gt;Tanya M Simpson<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Be sure to check out my online mall at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.blmall.com\">http://www.blmall.com</a><br/>\n please enter d81371220 in the space<br/>\nprovided for code number<br/>\nget paid $1 and hour for surfing the net!!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sendmoreinfo.com/id/38458\">http://www.sendmoreinfo.com/id/38458</a><br/>\nget paid to read email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sendmoreinfo.com/id/38458\">http://www.sendmoreinfo.com/id/38458</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Check it out!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jeff & Diane Gwirtz","from":"&quot;Jeff & Diane Gwirtz&quot; &lt;jagwirtz@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"xC76EowIdSQVxhVtAsDZKfwI7YrII3ygrWx7D2LHIpxUlLspWzWzBOyLPO6VTercefnHHWSLcSs3wOKFRBuTdfXGnIGY47vs24_LaaAhcg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: used violin?","postDate":"936449182","msgId":2540,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xODUuMjU0MC45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2535,"nextInTopic":2542,"prevInTime":2539,"nextInTime":2541,"topicId":2533,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
