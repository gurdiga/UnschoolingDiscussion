She lives in the city - a drive to the country seemed like a<br/>\nnice idea. We live on a newly acquired piece of land - we needed to work on our<br/>\nland and house building.

If I can&#39;t be honest then don&#39;t open my mouth at all. I<br/>\nalso do the distraction thing too - change the subject. This isn&#39;t very<br/>\ntactful, but everyone gets the message without us all having to go into the<br/>\nwhy&#39;s an wherefors of difference. I never &#39;agree to disagree&#39;. YEp, it does<br/>\nmake for difficult social times. But most people who know me think I am<br/>\nexceptionally tactful. I usually say what I think, but I think about what I<br/>\nsay first... I target what I say to my audience... I like to know my<br/>\naudience beforehand. <br/>\n<br/>\nDemanding clarification seems to really irk people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I find there&#39;s no one more honest than a kid.

What we are<br/>\ndoing is cultivating friendships with people who are willing to look at<br/>\nthis issue too.... finding support to keep growing with honesty in our<br/>\nlives. This is really hard. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut we don&#39;t demand perfection from ourselves either and realise that yep,<br/>\nwe fall from grace continuously.
