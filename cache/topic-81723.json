Since <br/>\nhe and his wife did not believe in this type of thing I suggested <br/>\nthat he try homeopathic treatment for the depression for the six <br/>\nweeks that his therapist would be gone on vacation, before she <br/>\nreturned to prescribe medication for him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe did and when he went back to see his therapist, presumably to get <br/>\na prescription for an anti-depressant, she saw such great improvement <br/>\nthat she not only did not prescribe any drugs, but said she did not <br/>\nneed to see him any longer unless something else came up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe has remained under homeopathic care, taking a constitutional <br/>\nremedy when needed, about every 4-6 months, and has never returned to <br/>\nhis suicidally depressed state, leads a full and very demanding life, <br/>\nfor 4 years now.

I am interested in hearing what <br/>\nthe signs might be, what the difference is between needing <br/>\nsome therapeutic support or input versus going to the MD for a <br/>\nreferral to a psychiatrist (who will no doubt want to prescribe <br/>\ndrugs).<br/>\n<br/>\nA family member is showing some signs, probably dealing with <br/>\nleft over pain from bullying for a number of years in early <br/>\nchildhood. But the residual in his life now is a lack of confidence <br/>\nin friendship building. There aren&#39;t obvious signs (like <br/>\nsleeplessness or anger or moodiness) but there is some <br/>\nlethargy and self-reporting on live journal etc. that leads us to <br/>\nbelieve that there may be depression or self-esteem stuff that <br/>\nneeds to be addressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny input would be welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81789,"nextTopicId":81795}}
