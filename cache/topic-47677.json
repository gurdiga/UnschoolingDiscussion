Margaret Mead was talking to some Balinese, trying to learn about this<br/>\nstrange and very different culture. At some point she asked about their<br/>\nart. The Balinese were puzzled by this question. They did not know what she<br/>\nmeant by art. So she talked for a while about art and artists in Western<br/>\ncultures. The Balinese considered this for a while. Then one of them spoke.<br/>\n&quot;Here in Bali we have no art,&quot; he said. &quot;We do everything as well as we can.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nVery little children are like the Balinese. Just about everything they do,<br/>\nthey do as well as they can. Except when tired or hungry, or in the grip of<br/>\npassion, pain, or fear, they are moved to act almost entirely by curiosity,<br/>\ndesire for mastery and competence, and pride in work well done. But the<br/>\nschools, and many adults outside of school, hardly ever recognize or honor<br/>\nsuch motives, can hardly even imagine that they exist. In their place they<br/>\nput Greed and Fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what about people who have taken out school children who have been<br/>\nnumbed and crippled in spirit by years of &quot;reinforcement,&quot; petty rewards<br/>\nand penalties, gold stars, M & M&#39;s, grades, Dean&#39;s Lists?  How can<br/>\nunschoolers revive in their children those earlier, deeper, richer sources<br/>\nof human action? It is not easy.  Perhaps the only thing to do is to be<br/>\npatient and wait.  After all, if we do not constantly re-injure our bodies, in<br/>\ntime they usually heal themselves.  We must act on faith that the same is<br/>\ntrue of the human spirit.  In short, if we give children enough time, as free<br/>\nas possible from destructive outside pressures, the chances are good that<br/>\nthey will once again find within themselves* their reasons for doing<br/>\nworthwhile things.  And so, in time, may we all.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt in Teach Your Own (1981)<br/>\n<br/>\n:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:<br/>\n<br/>\nRules/No Rules<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you do instead of ________________ (fill in the blank)?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answers to these questions so often don&#39;t seem to be heard or are<br/>\nsort of overlooked. I think that&#39;s because they don&#39;t entirely sound like<br/>\n&quot;answers&quot; to people who are looking for another concrete rule to replace<br/>\nthe one they&#39;re giving up. What we really give them are very general<br/>\nprinciples and examples of how those play out in our own specific and<br/>\nidiosyncratic lives - but that&#39;s hard to &quot;get&quot; when you&#39;re looking for a rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we don&#39;t have a rule that says &quot;bedtime is at 9 pm,&quot; then what bedtime <br/>\nrule DO we have? Lost of times people think that the new rule is then ONLY, <br/>\n&quot;bedtime is whenever it happens.&quot; They think that means the parents stop <br/>\nthinking about the child&#39;s sleep needs. But, in all the families that I know <br/>\nwho have no rule about bedtimes, the parents are consciously and actively <br/>\nhelping their kids get a good sense of taking care of their sleep needs. The <br/>\nrule doesn&#39;t just flip-flop from bedtime to &quot;no bedtime&quot;  -- there is a whole <br/>\nhuge different way of handling and learning about sleep needs that replaces <br/>\nthe entire concept of a &quot;bedtime.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo change the subject but make the same point...<br/>\n<br/>\n People at park day were having a conversation about video games and<br/>\nsome of us were talking about not setting limits on them. As usual,<br/>\nsomeone assumed that that meant that our kids would be spending 24<br/>\nhours a day, day after day, only on that with no other interests developing,<br/>\netc. So we were talking about that - about all the OTHER stuff that we do<br/>\nand how they learn, etc. (You&#39;ve heard it all before, here, so I&#39;m not<br/>\nrepeating all that -- but it was a lot of discussion there at the park.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen - there was this startling moment when one person said, &quot;But it is so <br/>\nexpensive to buy video games -- how can you let them have unlimited video <br/>\ngames without going broke? We could never afford that.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSilence.<br/>\n<br/>\nWow. Talk about flip-flopping. She took us arguing against rules like &quot;You <br/>\nmay have exactly one hour per day of video game time,&quot; or &quot;You may <br/>\nspend the afternoon playing absolutely anything you want as long as it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t involve TV or videogames&quot; as saying that we&#39;d buy our kids an <br/>\nunlimited stock of whatever videogames they wanted?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell - some of the kids happened to BE there right then and heard that bit <br/>\nand THEY reacted immediately with, &quot;We usually have to buy our OWN<br/>\ngames.&quot; She was somewhat bewildered, I think. In fact, I think it was news<br/>\nto her that we didn&#39;t control the videogame time of our kids with arbitrary<br/>\nrules. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that amused me  was that she&#39;d heard &quot;unlimited videogames&quot; as <br/>\nmeaning that we would BUY them whatever they wanted whenever they<br/>\nwanted them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk about a failure to communicate!!! When we say what we do NOT do (we <br/>\ndon&#39;t have bedtimes, for example) we sometimes can&#39;t even imagine what<br/>\npeople might be thinking we do do &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian in a conversation on the Unschooling.com email list.<br/>\nJoin the conversation!

The parents have a big gun, but they only have a limited amount<br/>\nof ammunition. They&#39;ve got to save that ammunition for the elephants, <br/>\nand not shoot the squirrels. So if a child tries to run across the street<br/>\nor put his or her finger into the light socket, that&#39;s something that <br/>\nwarrants shooting off the gun. Those are dangerous, elephant-size issues.<br/>\nThey involve serious, potentially life-threatening consequences, and they<br/>\nwarrant a loud, fast, clear, and very firm reaction -- a very large bang.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if you start using your elephant ammunition on every<br/>\nsquirrel that runs around your house -- every mess the child makes, every<br/>\nfood the child eats -- you&#39;re going to run out of ammunition when you <br/>\nreally need it for life-and-death areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nPractice letting the squirrels go by letting food issues go. In the context <br/>\nof the child&#39;s need for experimentation and independence, eating sugared<br/>\ncereal or an extra cookie at age two, or five, or ten is simply not a <br/>\ndangerous behavior -- certainly not the equivalent of stepping out into<br/>\ntraffic or drinking household poisons.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom Let Them Eat Cake! : The Case Against Controlling What Your <br/>\nChildren Eat: The Pediatrician&#39;s Guide to Safe and Healthy Food and <br/>\nGrowth by Ronald E.

These boards, <br/>\ndevoted entirely to legislative topics, will allow participants to discuss a<br/>\nwide variety of issues. Recent conversations include an in-depth look at <br/>\nstandardized testing in which one participant writes: I think it&#39;s ludicrous<br/>\nbeyond belief for state laws to require homeschooled students to score at<br/>\nor above a certain percentile on a standardized group achievement test<br/>\nthat is norm-referenced In response, participants offer research and<br/>\nanalysis, answer questions, and engage in spirited conversation. This is just<br/>\none of many conversations taking place.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscussions range from lists of books on education, to educational <br/>\nreform, to homeschooling regulation, and beyond. Six distinct forum <br/>\nareas contain numerous folders for discussion of wide-ranging issues. <br/>\nThese boards are easy to search and are conveniently segmented to <br/>\nallow on-topic, in-depth discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may be wary about utilizing message boards. You may believe, based<br/>\non other experiences, that they will be unwieldy or difficult to use. Not <br/>\ntrue at all! These boards are loaded with features that make navigation<br/>\na breeze. For instance, you can sign up to get new messages sent to <br/>\nyour e-mail address. You can edit or delete your posts. You can add a<br/>\nhyperlink to your posts, track all activity since your last visit, and search<br/>\nposts for specific topics. There is even a FAQ to help you learn about all<br/>\nthe features: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nhen.org/forum/faq.asp#format\">http://nhen.org/forum/faq.asp#format</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhat, you might be thinking, happened to the Legislative List that was so<br/>\nactive? Most of its activity has been transferred to the message boards,<br/>\nbut the Legislative List remains, albeit in a somewhat altered format. The<br/>\nLegislative List has been transformed into an announcement type list<br/>\nwhere brief announcements or requests for information can be posted. <br/>\nDuring this time of transformation all posts will pass through our capable <br/>\nmoderator, Kay Brooks, as she helps members discover what is appropriate<br/>\nfor that list and what is more appropriate for the new message boards.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease join this new online community at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nhen.org/forum.\">http://nhen.org/forum.</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:<br/>\n<br/>\nWEB Snacks<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gslc.genetics.utah.edu/units/activities/\">http://gslc.genetics.utah.edu/units/activities/</a><br/>\nDo Try This At Home!

If you look from the point of view of an experienced<br/>\nadult you will pay too much attention to those things that children do not<br/>\nyet know, rather than giving them credit for the intellectual feats they<br/>\nhave already achieved. Take the elementary matter of working out that <br/>\nwritten language says things.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do children get the idea that written language is worth paying attention<br/>\nto in the first place? How do they learn that there is a difference between<br/>\nprint and the pattern on the wallpaper? Before children can learn anything<br/>\nspecific about reading and writing, they have to work out that writing does<br/>\nthings that decoration does not. Most three-year-old children can show<br/>\nwhere it tell you that the contents of the package is corn flakes. They<br/>\npoint to the &quot;words,&quot; not to the decoration. They may claim the words say,<br/>\n&quot;Corn Flakes,&quot; when the word they are pointing to reads, &quot;Cereal,&quot; and what<br/>\nthey are showing is that they have learned the distinction between the<br/>\nprint and the decoration...<br/>\n<br/>\n...Parents can see the development of insight into written language by just<br/>\nwatching the changing way children use markers and paper. The first marks<br/>\nare likely to be balls of spaghetti, tangled scribbles and stab marks, whether<br/>\nthey represent writing or pictures. But while the &quot;drawings&quot; tend to organize<br/>\nthemselves into strokes and loops in the middle of the page, &quot;writing&quot;<br/>\nbecomes unraveled into individual lines, horizontal or vertical depending on<br/>\nthe conventions of the community in which the child lives. Soon the lines get<br/>\nbreaks in them, as children discover the existence of words, and in due<br/>\ncourse the individual words are broken up into &quot;letters,&quot; even though the<br/>\nchild may have to invent many of them. The young author may even ask you<br/>\nto read the story that has been written in these lines and squiggles. Meaning <br/>\ncomes first -- the process of understanding written language starts with<br/>\nunderstanding entire stories or statements and then goes on to understand-<br/>\ning sentences, words, and finally letters, the reverse of the way most<br/>\nchildren are expected to learn to &quot;read&#39; in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank Smith in Insult to Intelligence (1986)<br/>\n<br/>\n:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:<br/>\n<br/>\nUNSCHOOLING.COM ONLINE NEWS UNCLASSIFIED ADVERTISING<br/>\n<br/>\nFor information on purchasing unclassified advertising space in this <br/>\nnewsletter, please contact the editor at: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:newsletter@...\">newsletter@...</a><br/>\n________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE RESOURCEFUL HOMESCHOOLER<br/>\n<br/>\nAttention unschoolers and eclectic homeschoolers!
