My <br/>\nsister is a lunchroom helper at her daughter&#39;s school, and one day she <br/>\nattended a school seminar for teachers and other employees.  One of the <br/>\nspeakers spoke on vaccination, specifically pertussis.  When she came home, <br/>\nshe called me at our parents house.  (To make matters worse, all three of my <br/>\nchildren were sick with whooping cough at the time, believed to have been <br/>\npassed along by sick grandfather.)  She started explaining to me that I <br/>\nshould vaccinate because PEOPLE DIE from whooping cough.  I tried to explain <br/>\nmy research, and that the majority of deaths are not in previously healthy, <br/>\nrobust people like my children, and so on ...., and that she could plainly <br/>\nsee my children were not terribly sick from whooping cough.  She then made <br/>\nthe huge leap to accuse me that the only reason I homeschool is because I <br/>\nwon&#39;t vaccinate.  I (still polite) explained that I could write a religious <br/>\nor personal exemption letter if I would like to send my children to school.  <br/>\nAnd my homeschooling and lack of vaccinations are entirely unrelated except <br/>\nin my desire to do what I feel is best for my children.  She then jumped back <br/>\nto the pertussis vaccine and said again PEOPLE DIE.  I tried to explain that <br/>\nI had compiled volumes of paperwork, read books, and even my M.D. supports my <br/>\nvaccination decisions, and she starts quoting some county nurse that spoke at <br/>\nthe seminar that PEOPLE DIE.  I asked what specific arguments did she have so <br/>\nthat I could counter them, because I had done the research.  She then said <br/>\nshe did not want to discuss it because I am wrong and will never agree.  I <br/>\nsaid I did not want to discuss it if she was going to be uninformed on the <br/>\nsubject and quote one biased person&#39;s opinion as her only argument.
