I have an unschooling moment to share.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI bought a cookbook for cooking with kids.  I thought it would be fun to try <br/>\nsome kid-friendly recipes and maybe get some kid interest in the process.  My <br/>\nalmost 8 year old son was very excited, although he&#39;s never shown more than a <br/>\npassing interest in working in the kitchen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I couldn&#39;t find my cup measure when I needed it, and I asked my son how <br/>\nmany 1/2 cups I&#39;d need, and he said 2, Duh Mom.  He was making a bread recipe <br/>\nthat required that he cut canned biscuits into quarters.  So he started <br/>\ncutting them in half then in half again, just like he was supposed to.  I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t need to tell him.  I asked him how he knew, and he told me that <br/>\nquarters means 1/4 which is 4 pieces.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve really never talked about fractions at all, and I was a bit surprised <br/>\nthat he knew this.  I remember fractions being such a struggle in school.  Of <br/>\ncourse, algebra isn&#39;t quite as intuitive, but I guess my point is, if you <br/>\nmake it hard, it will be hard.  If you make it life, maybe it comes as <br/>\nnaturally as life does.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarron</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12230,"nextTopicId":12246}}
