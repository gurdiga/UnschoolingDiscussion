I promise to introduce myself properly later  but, right now<br/>\nI need some help.  I have been asked to give the commencement address at a<br/>\nlocal homeschooler&#39;s graduation.  I just found out 6 days ago and 3 1/2 of<br/>\nthose days I have been without water at home, ( with a husband offshore for<br/>\nthe next two weeks), trying to play plumber and have simply not had time to<br/>\nwrite an address.  We live out in the country and have had well problems<br/>\nbut...that is a whole other story.  Now the graduation is tomorrow afternoon<br/>\nand I want to do a good job.  The mom has had ZERO support from church and<br/>\nfamily.  In fact her words to me were &quot;I have had 12 years of hell over this<br/>\nand this is the culmination of it all (this graduation) - I know you will<br/>\nspeak your mind, show homeschooling in a positive way and I need you to do<br/>\nthis for me.&quot;  Well, what could I say?   I have 6 children, 3 of whom have<br/>\n&quot;graduated&quot;...our sons who are 22 and 19 are very accomplished in what they<br/>\ndo.  The oldest was my &quot;scholarly&quot; child...and was a department head for his<br/>\ncompany at 21.  The second son at 18 was the youngest store manager in the<br/>\nhistory of the same company and they have family working for them - that he<br/>\nis now over.  My oldest daughter just married and has started what is<br/>\napparently going to be a very successful catering business.  So, no,  my<br/>\nchildren have not gone on to be doctors and lawyers but, I wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nbeen any more please with their successes if they had.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow...I really need to know where to find FACTS about homeschooling...what<br/>\nkind of company this child is in now that she is among those going on to the<br/>\nnext stage of her life -hopefully still learning, who have been schooled at<br/>\nhome.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do so appreciate anything you can say - any web site you can point me<br/>\nto...honest I am not being lazy...I am so pressed for time and I really want<br/>\nto set a few records straight.<br/>\nThanks so much...<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nSusan<br/>\nwife to Jerry<br/>\nmom to Zach, Jessica, Nathan, Hannah, Rachel and Benjamin<br/>\n<br/>\nDahlem&#39;s Handcrafted Soaps<br/>\nwww.dahlemshandcraftedsoap.com<br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*Motherhood is a Sacred Journey*~*~*~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20643,"nextTopicId":20644}}
