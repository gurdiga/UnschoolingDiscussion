We&#39;ve <br/>\nunschooled for the past 4 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike some others have said, homeschooling is pretty easy here. You need to <br/>\nnotify the county of your intent to homeschool and that&#39;s it. There are LOTS <br/>\nof homeschooling groups here, both secular and religious. There are also a <br/>\nfew unschooling groups around town. I am the listowner of <br/>\nPhoenix_Unschoolers and here&#39;s your invitation to join if you&#39;d like.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Phoenix_Unschoolers-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">Phoenix_Unschoolers-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nor visit this address on the web: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Phoenix_Unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Phoenix_Unschoolers/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake Care,<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\nps- that invite for the Phoenix_Unschoolers list is good for anyone else on <br/>\nthis list, as well! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Brenda&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lvmydd@...\">lvmydd@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi All,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading all your emails for over a year now, I guess.  Anyhow, I <br/>\n&gt; love this group and have gotten such wonderful inspiration from you all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My name is Brenda and I have a wonderful dd R who will be 5 next month. <br/>\n&gt; We will be unschooling, continuing our path of life long learning.  I am a <br/>\n&gt; single mom currently living in So Cal.  But, I&#39;m planning to move out of <br/>\n&gt; the area as I just can no longer afford to live here and unschool.  Being <br/>\n&gt; able to work at home is my priority, so that I can be with my daughter and <br/>\n&gt; she can continue to learn whatever she desires.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am seriously considering moving to Arizona, the Phoenix area.  I thought <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d ask here first if anyone knows of any unschooling groups in that area, <br/>\n&gt; or even a good secular homeschooling group would do too.  Also, if anyone <br/>\n&gt; has any idea about the homeschooling laws in AZ?  Is it a hs friendly <br/>\n&gt; place to live?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Brenda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105775,"nextTopicId":105687}}
