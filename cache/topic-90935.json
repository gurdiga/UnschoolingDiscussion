She <br/>\nREALLY wanted to have one like the &quot;big&quot; kids so I just redid the application and <br/>\n&quot;made&quot; her 13, or maybe it was 12 but I just changed the year to reflect the <br/>\nminimum and there were no problems.  I had asked a customer service person <br/>\nabout this and why the requirement, they are the ones that told me to just change <br/>\nthe year.  I guess they worry too much about really younger kids loosing or <br/>\nmisplacing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes Cait would have a bit of a problem when she went to use her card, <br/>\nbut we got her an ID from the DMV with her picture and name and they always <br/>\naccepted that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I think they are more used to kids having VISA cards and she never has a <br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt works out very well when my kids are going on trips and such and you don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to have to give them hundreds of dollars in cash, if they loose that, <br/>\nit&#39;s just gone.  Here you can put it on the card and they have 24 hr emergency <br/>\nreplacements available, if it&#39;s lost or stolen.  Also if they run out of money <br/>\nwhile they are gone, you just have to log on to the computer and add more for <br/>\nthem, WAY cheaper than western union, no charge at all!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think First Bank of Tennessee has them without an age requirement if I <br/>\nremember correctly, but some do say you need to be 13.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids feel very in charge of their purchases and have records they can access <br/>\nonline to keep track of how much they&#39;ve spent and how much they have left.<br/>\n<br/>\nMine really think they are great.  My older boy still has his, they do offer <br/>\nyou a regular VISA when you turn 18 or are about to turn 18 but he didn&#39;t get <br/>\none, preferring to just keep his Visa Buxx card.

You set up the accounts (online for FREE), <br/>\nand you are given a password to use to put money into their account.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey use the card just like a VISA card and can withdraw cash at ATM&#39;s just a <br/>\nregular card.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost every place takes VISA now, including the fast food restaurants around <br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of my children were always very responsible with their money, part were <br/>\nnot.  That only came to be a problem when one child would spend all their <br/>\nmoney on something great and fun and have nothing left over the next week for say <br/>\nlunch out or a movie or something else.  I always paid the extra for the child <br/>\nwho was without but it didn&#39;t seem fair to the others who didn&#39;t spend all <br/>\ntheirs at once.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe VISA cards helped them think more before they picked something up and <br/>\nbought it.  It helped them feel more grown up to have a VISA card at a young age <br/>\n(the youngest since 12) with their own name on it.  They also get a monthly <br/>\nonline statement that they can check at anytime to help them remember and know <br/>\nwhat they&#39;ve spent their purchases on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis helps if your child gets/saves a large amount of cash, it&#39;s safer than <br/>\ncarrying cash around and possibly laying one&#39;s purse down or losing it.  It <br/>\ngives you the same safety as a regular VISA in that if you report it lost or <br/>\nstolen, your money is safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also give them pin number to grandparents or relatives who want to <br/>\nsend a birthday gift or whatever to the child.

We talk <br/>\nabout what their private money is going to get used for, how much they <br/>\nwant to spend on that, etc., and determine an amount. Turns out that <br/>\nabout $1 for each year of age is a good proxy - until they get older. <br/>\nWhen they started wanting things that make me uncomfortable to spend <br/>\nmoney on, they get private control over more money so that the decision <br/>\nis &quot;real&quot; for them. In other words, if the money is really theirs, they <br/>\nthink the decision through more - because if they don&#39;t spend it on <br/>\nthat thing, they still have it to spend on something else. This is <br/>\ndifferent and nicer than Roya, for example, asking me if she can buy <br/>\n&quot;this skirt&quot; (and me looking at it and thinking it isn&#39;t worth the $40) <br/>\nwhen, to her it IS worth it and she&#39;d show it by saving up for it and <br/>\ngiving up spending money on other things, if she had it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI HIGHLY recommend that teenage girls, at least, have money of their <br/>\nown to make their own clothing choices. We gave Roya $50 per month and <br/>\nshe bought all her own clothes, cd&#39;s, and gifts for friends. These <br/>\nthree things seemed to be things she was constantly asking for and I <br/>\nwas constantly having to decide if I&#39;d buy it &quot;this time&quot; or not. We <br/>\nhave enough money to buy any of them without breaking the bank, but her <br/>\ndesires were pretty much insatiable, as long as she wasn&#39;t personally <br/>\nfeeling what was being given up in order for her to spend that money.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was very generous, but since it was bugging me that she&#39;d spend far <br/>\ntoo much (imo) on gifts for friends, it took all the potential stress <br/>\nout of our relationship when she had plenty of money to make her own <br/>\ndecisions about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she got a real job and had lots of money and that was good too <br/>\nbecause she really overspent - feeling wealthy - and then regretted not <br/>\nhaving saved more and 17 or 18 years old is a good time to DO that.<br/>\n<br/>\nRosie is 13 and knowing that she has money coming to her on the 1st of <br/>\neach month, she pores over the American Girl catalog and makes notes <br/>\nabout what books she wants from the bookstore and saves up over months <br/>\nto get a ticket to some musical theater production that is coming to <br/>\ntown.

I usually tell her she can only<br/>\nhave one thing and sometimes we go through many many trade offs (she<br/>\npicks up a scoobie doo umbrella then trades it to me for a stuffed<br/>\nbear then gives that back for a baloon, then.... ) often ending up<br/>\nwith a chocolate bar or cookies from the store&#39;s bakery. As long as<br/>\nshe gets to pick one thing she seems content (at least for now!) to<br/>\nput back everything else.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGrowing up, I was never given any money because my parents felt that<br/>\nby providing shelter, food and clothes they had already met all the<br/>\nneeds I could possibly have. I remember being 7 and going through<br/>\ntheir pockets and stealing whatever change was there because there<br/>\nwere little things I wanted, like a small pastry from the bakery<br/>\nwhere I was sent for bread. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I became a teanger my parents insisted I get a job and take the<br/>\nbrunt of my clothing expences on myself. When you have no skills,<br/>\nexperience or job trainingm, hunting for jobs trully sucks. And the<br/>\njobs one finds are often rather sucky too. Even when I was able to<br/>\nfind a job, my salary never covered even half of the things I felt I<br/>\nneeded and I was always tempted to shoplift. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I am saying is everyone needs to have a little pocket<br/>\nmoney for those little &#39;umpulse buys&#39; throuhout the day and as a<br/>\nperson becomes older their needs grow and teangers especially often<br/>\nfeel very bad about themselves if they cannot create a desirable<br/>\nimage for themselves... I think it may be better for the parents to<br/>\nmake some sacrifices and offer the spending money their child needs<br/>\nrather then have that child tempted to steal.<br/>\n<br/>\nInna<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Melissa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:melissa4123@...\">melissa4123@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do you all feel about weekly allowances?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
