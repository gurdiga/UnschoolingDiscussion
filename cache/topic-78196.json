If people come here and think it sucks why do<br/>\nthey stay?<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree.  I have only been here a short time and I have found it to be <br/>\na very good tool while I am just getting started on my unschooling <br/>\npath.  It is a very important goal for me and I have a lot to let go of <br/>\nto get there.  The honesty and simplicity with which my requests have <br/>\nbeen answered is causing me to look at my self closely.  That&#39;s not <br/>\neasy and I suppose one needs to be ready to do that in order for it to <br/>\nbe helpful.  I for one am grateful to be able to bend the ear of other <br/>\nfolks who are living in a style I want for myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nas for the slug discussion, I have a friend who greeted both my new <br/>\nbabies with &#39;Well, hello there lump!&#39;  I thought it was such a cool <br/>\nwelcome the first time, and very welcome and familiar the second.  Made <br/>\nme think of homemade gravy or something.  They are lumps! soft, round, <br/>\noften wet and milky but warm.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nHeather, mom to<br/>\nHarriet 12.15.99<br/>\nCrispin 01.25.02<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heatherette@...\">heatherette@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78101,"nextTopicId":78181}}
