I want to introduce myself, and I<br/>\nfeel the need to tell you a little bit of my history.  Please forgive<br/>\nme if I ramble and sound a bit melodramatic!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Robin and I have two little ones.  My dd is age 5 and my ds<br/>\nis 2.5. We live in Virginia.<br/>\n<br/>\nI almost sent my dd to kindergarten this year, but couldn&#39;t follow<br/>\nthrough. First of all, something just didn&#39;t feel right to me about<br/>\nleaving her in the hands of people that I don&#39;t know.  I even went to<br/>\nthe main office and requested to interview my daughter&#39;s teacher to<br/>\nbe.  Of course, you can imagine the response!  I guess the irony of it<br/>\nall is that I *am* a teacher( secondary English/psychology).  I knew<br/>\n*better* than to even ask the question...but some voice inside me just<br/>\nblurted it out anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou see, I went into &quot;the field&quot; because I wanted to make a<br/>\ndifference.  I thought that the *ways* of the system were flawed<br/>\n(objectives, methodologies); and the college that I attended, I<br/>\nthought, addressed these flaws.  My professors challenged the concept<br/>\nof standardized testing.  Emplement creative alternatives to testing,<br/>\nthey said.  Access student personal experience...make what you teach<br/>\n*relevant*. Give a purpose that is meaningful to the lives of your<br/>\nstudents. Portfolio learning.  Cooperative learning.  Learning across<br/>\ncurriculum. Creativity. I was excited.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I became pregnant.  Other than a year in &quot;the system&quot; working as<br/>\na teacher&#39;s assistant while I was pregnant, I, well, kind of forgot<br/>\nabout it....my life went in another direction.  My short experience in<br/>\nthe school system was disappointing, and I hoped my experience was a<br/>\nfluke....surely things weren&#39;t that bad everywhere?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here I am walking under the &quot;golden arches&quot; called &quot;school of<br/>\nexcellence&quot; at my dds soon to be elementary school; and I think, &quot;This<br/>\nwill be okay.  This is a beautiful school.  Surely they are a<br/>\nportfolio; purposeful, relevent minded; cooperative, creative kind of<br/>\nplace!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n I am invited to observe in my dd&#39;s future Kindergarten teacher&#39;s<br/>\nclass, and my hopeful bubble is politely, but quickly burst.  Words<br/>\nlike stressful and SOLs (Standards of Learning) are used. No time for<br/>\n&quot;one-on-one;&quot; no time for a nurturing environment.  One fourth of the<br/>\nclass were &quot;held back&quot; before ever starting school to make sure they<br/>\nwere *ready*, I&#39;m told. Then, on my way out, I see a pile of papers in<br/>\nthe handwriting of these children in this classroom, who had copied<br/>\nsentences from off the board.... and one with red marks all over it. <br/>\nThat image is stuck in my mind.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so we&#39;re not going back; and I&#39;m left wondering what happened in<br/>\nthe schools....I was so hopeful...I thought by now....the &quot;ways&quot; of<br/>\nthe system....  It wasn&#39;t until I joined a local homeschool chat group<br/>\nthat I even began to think that it wasn&#39;t the &quot;ways&#39; of the system,<br/>\nbut the *system itself*.... and, that I might just be &quot;bringing it all<br/>\nhome,&quot; so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now I&#39;m here wanting to unschool (think I&#39;m the one that needs the<br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; though...my dd pretty much knows how).
