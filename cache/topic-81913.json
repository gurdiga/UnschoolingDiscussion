He<br/>\ntrusts alot to me but really, honestly he feels alot better about things<br/>\nif I can say, &quot;yes we read today&quot;.

But if one expressed concern, I&#39;d ask <br/>\nwho they were thinking of (it was always one specific kid or another) and would <br/>\npoint out what they could do better than that child, and that there could come <br/>\na time when the other child would surpass them there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey all read perfectly well.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby didn&#39;t know the word &quot;polygamy&quot; when he glanced over at an article <br/>\nabout the northern Arizona fundamentalist Mormon town that&#39;s been in the news.

It wasn&#39;t news to him, just the word itself was new.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat happens a lot with my kids.  Their understanding of the concepts and <br/>\nideas is way beyond their reading.  Their aural (heard and understood) vocabulary <br/>\nis larger than their visual vocabulary, so they have an easy time recognizing <br/>\nwords and sounding words out.  They KNOW the words.   In school it&#39;s often <br/>\nthe other way.  Kids are sounding out words they&#39;ve never had cause to hear <br/>\nbefore, so they waste a lot of time looking things up and writing down and trying <br/>\nto memorize definitions.  If they learned more language before they tried to <br/>\nread, reading would be EASY.

I do my own reading when I can<br/>\nsnatch a few minutes, and she asks me to read to her when she wants to<br/>\nread. Or she asks me to put one of her games into the computer for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry to sound harsh, but that whole conversation seems contrived.<br/>\nJust because he didn&#39;t care for Barney (and I don&#39;t blame him for that)<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean that he didn&#39;t have some other activity in mind for<br/>\nhimself. Does he have the freedom to say &quot;Not right now&quot; (one of Jayn&#39;s<br/>\nfavorite phrases) and go about his business? Do you perceive doing<br/>\nnothing in particular as vegetative idleness, or as someone involved<br/>\nwith their own important thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And we read the book. I help him where he needs it and then he does a<br/>\nfinal re-read. That&#39;s it. No more workbooks or painful phonics lessons.<br/>\nHe isn&#39;t bothered by it and we get to &quot;check off reading&quot; for Dad, who<br/>\nisn&#39;t all that interested in this experiment of mine but who tolerates<br/>\nit<br/>\nas long as he knows I&#39;m at least trying to let reading and math fall<br/>\ninto<br/>\nthier path to stumble over daily.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of threads in the archives and message boards about<br/>\nreluctant spouses. How would you feel if you husband had a list of<br/>\nparticular housework tasks you had to accomplish and you had to check<br/>\nthem off each day? What happens when you don&#39;t get through the<br/>\ndesignated tasks? I feel that any practice that sets up (1) one parent<br/>\nas an authority that must be deferred to rather than a partner, (2) you<br/>\nhaving to manipulate the information that your husband is getting about<br/>\nthe children&#39;s day, is a dangerous practice and contrary to the living<br/>\nin freedom life of joy that Unschooling can be. Gee I hope you can help<br/>\nyour husband around. James, my dh, had a great time at the conference,<br/>\nand met a spectrum of fathers along the path to acceptance. We also<br/>\nfound out just how much more he gets it than I realized about him<br/>\nanyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you have been doing doesn&#39;t sound like the benign &quot;strewing&quot; you<br/>\nseem to desire it to be. It seems more active and always with ulterior<br/>\nmotives. Gosh that sounds sinister. Lots of threads about strewing in<br/>\nthe archives also.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I never assume that Jayn is feeling a certain way or is &quot;not<br/>\nbothered&quot; about something, unless I ask her specifically and in a<br/>\nnon-leading way. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve been waiting for them to learn about money.  So yesterday I put<br/>\nout<br/>\na toy catalog for them to find and they asked how much something cost. I<br/>\nshowed them where the price near the description was. They asked about<br/>\ndollars and cents so we talked all about that.  I got out the play money<br/>\nand equivelent flash cards and they learned about that. I wrote it down<br/>\nas math and they had something to show dad when he came home.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYou lost faith - some kind of mental timetable you are still holding on<br/>\nto made you lose patience with the process, so you had to take action.<br/>\nJayn calls the toy catalogues that come her &quot;magazines&quot;. I don&#39;t even<br/>\nlook at them, just pass them to her. She gets so excited by new things,<br/>\nand sometimes is disgusted when all they do is repeat the items in the<br/>\nlast catalogue. She sometimes asks about prices. Sometimes I have to<br/>\ntell her things are too expensive for us to afford right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If they hadn&#39;t asked about cost, and just wanted to look at the toys,<br/>\nit<br/>\nwould have been fine. I would have though looked for another place to<br/>\n&quot;drop&quot; math into thier path. If he hadn&#39;t wanted to sit and read, I<br/>\nwould<br/>\nhave written post-it notes around the house or something, for him to<br/>\nfind, and get practice that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s wrong? Please explain.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not wrong, so much as not Unschooling. It is still your need to<br/>\nlook like something got done, your priorities, your either conscious or<br/>\nunconscious need to keep up and take responsibility for their EDUCATION<br/>\nand PROGRESS, instead of allowing them to be responsible for their own<br/>\nlearning.  It is still separating &quot;life&quot; from &quot;educational activities&quot;,<br/>\nwith the attendant belief that educational activities are &quot;better&quot; than<br/>\nthe others, and that a day without (insert subject here) is an<br/>\nincomplete day. If it is easier for you, try imagining that every thing<br/>\nis educational. Personally I like to think that nothing has to be. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe real problem is what you and your children are missing out on with<br/>\nall this &quot;dropping of math into their path&quot; - which is the excitement<br/>\nand joy of spontaneously finding the math both on and off the path and<br/>\nrunning to show you what they found; the fulfillment of choosing and<br/>\nknowing it is a real choice to read/do something - how do you know that<br/>\nyour son was not on the point of making a request to you to do some<br/>\nreading? You don&#39;t have to &quot;practice&quot; reading - you just read stuff that<br/>\nis interesting to you; you don&#39;t have to &quot;practice&quot; math if you have<br/>\nreal internal reasons for doing it. Jayn sometimes gets a bug about<br/>\nmeasuring stuff with her little retractable measuring tape. Why? I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow, but her reasons are as serious to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":43907726,"authorName":"Tia Graham","from":"Tia Graham &lt;sixredheads@...&gt;","profile":"clarasmommy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Maybe a silly line of thought....","postDate":"1065137843","msgId":81963,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMxMDAyLjIwMTc0NC4tNDM3MDAxLjI2LnNpeHJlZGhlYWRzQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":81959,"nextInTopic":81965,"prevInTime":81962,"nextInTime":81964,"topicId":81913,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Where are you in Florida?

He on the other hand, when he gets a free even ing where he can sit<br/>\non here for an hour or so goes nuts. He loves it, he&#39;s good at it and really<br/>\nenjoys it.

I think that<br/>\npretty much goes for most things in life.

It&#39;s one<br/>\nshow he watches that I just don&#39;t enjoy. But I would never say it was<br/>\nstupid. For him, it&#39;s not at all. That show lead to him wanting to play the<br/>\ncard game. That lead to him reading better, it lead to him doing math<br/>\nbetter. Then he wanted to enter tournaments and I watched this skinny little<br/>\n8 year old waltz into a store like he owned the place, walk up to 17 year<br/>\nold strangers and have a conversation with them and either play a game or<br/>\ntrade cards like he was doing it all his life.

The things he came across on his own or discovered while we <br/>\nwere out and about were frequently better than I could have planned!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;The old question of &quot;when do they learn that days are not just<br/>\nabout play&quot; comes up. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at the adults you know.  Some quit playing years ago.  They shut down <br/>\ntheir senses of humor, they closed off their sense of wonder, they blush if they <br/>\naccidently have a fleeting thought that something is REALLY COOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t want your kids to be that way, do you?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen ARE days not just about play?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been collecting morning glory seeds to give to my sister who&#39;s just <br/>\ngotten a new house.  Every day I go out and collect seeds.  It&#39;s fun.  It&#39;s <br/>\nsoothing.  It has become a game for me, and I&#39;m learning a lot about the plants.  In <br/>\npast years I&#39;ve waited until after frost to collect seeds, but the <br/>\nhousewarming party is next weekend, the 12th, and that&#39;s pre-frost.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt only takes half a day for some pods that weren&#39;t dry to dry breakable.  A <br/>\nfull day, one can be totally dry.  So I check every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could spend $2 and buy her some seeds, or not even bother.  She could buy <br/>\nher own damned seeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I started going to bed at 10:00, but one thing and another <br/>\nhappened with the kids, so at 11:45 I was FINALLY saying &quot;This is it, see you guys.&quot;  <br/>\nKirby had a friend over, and they were playing a game.  Marty was on the <br/>\ncomputer, and listening to music.  Holly had been doing something that involved <br/>\ncloth and dolls.  As I was loading the dishwasher, I muttered that the floor <br/>\nneeded to be mopped.   Holly said &quot;That&#39;s MY job!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s never done it before, and I don&#39;t do it a whole lot myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo she asked me a couple of logistical questions, and I thanked her and went <br/>\nto bed, while she was sweeping in preparation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI woke up this morning.  The kitchen was mopped really well.  The mop had <br/>\nbeen rinsed and was set in a good place to dry.  Downstairs, there was a pile of <br/>\nphonics worksheets (out of a phonics book that surfaced when we rearranged the <br/>\nden), filled out, torn out, scattered on the floor in front of the TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly and Marty and I had planned to get up at 9:00 to watch Wayne Brady.  I <br/>\ngot up at 6:30, did a bunch of stuff, woke them up and they were both too <br/>\ntired and decided to pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were just going to do it for fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby goes to work at 11:30 and then teaches beginning karate at 4:00, takes <br/>\nhis own level class at 5:00, and a weapons/kobudo class at 6:00.  That&#39;s a <br/>\nseriously scheduled day for him.  Yet it&#39;s play, because they&#39;re things he <br/>\nchooses to do, and likes to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;They are happy and relaxed and exploratory...just what I want my kids to<br/>\nbe! And it hasn&#39;t always been this way so I appreciate the progress. But<br/>\nis it ever time to &quot;grow up&quot;?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf by &quot;grow up&quot; you mean stop thinking the world is a wonderful place, maybe <br/>\nyou should take back your wish.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf by &quot;grow up&quot; you mean grow through the stage of adolescence, realize they <br/>\ncould reproduce, start to experience the urge to maybe go out on their own, <br/>\nmaybe mate, maybe explore the world without mom or dad, yes.  That will happen <br/>\nif you&#39;re lucky.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf by &quot;grow up&quot; you mean prematurally pretend to be &quot;grown&quot; and <br/>\nsober/serious/businesslike/no-nonsense, people have been doing that for a long time, and it <br/>\nhasn&#39;t made the world a better place.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are 17, 14 and 11.  They&#39;re responsible with their things.  They keep <br/>\ntheir word.  They&#39;re considerate of others&#39; feelings.  They&#39;re honest and <br/>\ncareful with money.
