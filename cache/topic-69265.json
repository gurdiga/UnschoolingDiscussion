This is the middle of something longer, with a link to the whole thing, and other similar-in-a-way bits by others:<br/>\n<br/>\n___________<br/>\nI vividly remember there being a point several years into unschooling when I realized that so many of the things that had taken conscious effort in the beginning, had become second nature for me at some point along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my answer would be, be conscious of what you&#39;re saying and doing. Be more aware of your thoughts. If you act or react in a knee-jerk way that doesn&#39;t help relationships with your family, apologize to them and make a different, better choice in that moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found it pretty easy to make the paradigm shift in my interactions with my son, but it was much harder to make that shift in my interactions with my husband. And that&#39;s still an ongoing change in our relationship, although it does come more naturally now—but it&#39;s still not as seamless as it is for me in my interactions with my son.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m tired or hungry or don&#39;t feel well, I have to be more thoughtful about how I talk to my husband and how I think about him, because it&#39;s easy for me to slip into a negative place and to focus on the things he didn&#39;t do that I wish he had or the things he did that annoyed me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the best things I&#39;ve done for our marriage is to be more quiet when I&#39;m tired/hungry/not feeling well. In those instances, I&#39;m more prone to feel like snarking at my husband, or commenting on something he did / didn&#39;t do, or otherwise saying something that would be hurtful to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n___________<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/change/\">http://sandradodd.com/change/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unsupportive partner - situation approaching crisis","postDate":"1350099643","msgId":69360,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIxQkU0Q0E0LThCMzUtNDExOS05NDUwLTc0Q0M4Qzg5RjIxM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGs0bzJyaytvMjAyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGs0bzJyaytvMjAyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69320,"nextInTopic":69361,"prevInTime":69359,"nextInTime":69361,"topicId":69265,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-=== I told him that I wished he would read some about unschooling (I was thinking of Sandra s site), and he said something like just because I didn t read","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-352958499\">-=-=== I told him that I wished he would read some about unschooling (I was thinking of Sandra&#39;s site), and he said something like &quot;just because I didn&#39;t read that guy&#39;s book&quot;, and I asked &quot;What guy?&quot; and he said &quot;John Holt!&quot; and in a voice dripping with contempt, started to describe John Taylor Gatto. ===<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Well at least he has done some reading.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it didn&#39;t save him.

I told them about outings and trips, sent photos of them out of town, in town.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother benefit to that is that they have something to say when they talk to their son, other than &quot;What are the kids doing?&quot;  They have a better starting place and can say &quot;Kirby seems to be enjoying his karate school,&quot; or something solid, and then Keith didn&#39;t need to feel the burden of explaining.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHis mom died just a few years ago, and his dad is 93 or 94 and doesn&#39;t care as much as he used to, and our kids are grown.  I got through all that by offering information.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd about gifts, rather than trying to make my kids write thank-you notes, I would send a letter with a photo of the child using/wearing the gift, and tell a story about how he appreciated it, and what he said when he opened it, or something like that.

In an effort to build a better<br/>\ngingerbread house,  my kids an I  learned math skills, design skills, and<br/>\nengineering:)  As the kids got more interested in building a better<br/>\nhouse--the cookie recipe changed, size of pieces to build changed, research<br/>\nwas a factor, and measuring was more precise. Of course as with all family<br/>\nbaking we needed:  team work, reading, chemistry and math.  They learned<br/>\nwhat they wanted/needed along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBaking might be a fun way for any dad to enjoy his children&#39;s feats of<br/>\nengineering, math and chemistry :)  He can either join in the making or the<br/>\neating.

It seems like I made a really big mistake in giving up on that, but it hurt so much to get rejected over and over.===<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of guys don&#39;t want to read a lot of stuff. They like bullet points and simplicity. My husband prefers things shining from a screen that are brief and pointed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there&#39;s something else here. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are taking his dislike of reading this material as a personal rejection, a rejection of you. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if he felt rejected by your persistent efforts to change him with all this reading? What if every time you mentioned another piece of writing by some unschooling or parenting writer, he heard yet another criticism of himself, and his values, and his efforts for you?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you have not met him with compassion or validation. It sounds like every time he expresses a fear or concern, you might have told him in effect, &quot;You don&#39;t know what you are talking about. You are ignorant and stupid. Go read these people who are smarter than you in every way&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband James totally gets unschooling, has spoken at conferences, and has a deep, intuitive understanding of natural learning. Despite our idyllic unschooling life we do disagree sometimes - usually my fault. <br/>\n<br/>\nYet even he gets annoyed if during any kind of conflict I start quoting unschoolers as ammunition for my point of view. Boy, does that irritate him to no end - even though he generally agrees with the info I may be quoting.<br/>\n<br/>\n=== He demanded that I convince him that our children are learning.===<br/>\n<br/>\nIf our home States can make these demands of so many of us, it is not actually unreasonable that a loving father should wish for reassurance that his children are learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can possibly let go of the idea that &quot;he demanded&quot; something, let go of returning his demand with one of your own (&quot;read this stuff about other people&#39;s kids&quot;), and see instead the loving motive behind it - his need for reassurance, his need to take care of his kids and see them safe and happy - you will find it a much easier need to meet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure that your choices are between fully unschooling or putting your kids into school. If asking your kids to join you in doing some math worksheets, or putting together some lap books, or making a poster about some grade appropriate interesting topic, will provide that reassurance to him for now, surely that is less onerous than putting them into school. It might be enough. <br/>\n<br/>\n=== I told him that I wished he would read some about unschooling (I was thinking of Sandra&#39;s site), and he said something like &quot;just because I didn&#39;t read that guy&#39;s book&quot;, and I asked &quot;What guy?&quot; and he said &quot;John Holt!&quot; and in a voice dripping with contempt, started to describe John Taylor Gatto. ===<br/>\n<br/>\nWell at least he has done some reading. It MAY have been so challenging to him, perhaps even painful if it described some of his schooling past, that it drove him into denial. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe may be reacting with contempt to what he feels is your contempt for him, in comparison to these luminaries.<br/>\n<br/>\n==== I literally couldn&#39;t face the idea of even having children until I found out about unschooling.===<br/>\n<br/>\nOr it MAY be that you have a lot more school damage to heal than he does. It may be that he genuinely had a ball at school, and really doesn&#39;t get what is wrong with schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople are always going to bring their own past experiences and beliefs into any situation. Two people can witness the same event or hear the same story and have two entirely different reactions. Some people will read anything with an eye to confirming their own beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\n=== He demanded to know how our 7.5 yo was going to learn calculus. ===<br/>\n<br/>\n(Bet he found calculus challenging when he was in school.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the slightly hysterical statement of a person in the grip of fear, since no ordinary 7.5 year old (outside of bona fide genius prodigies) studies calculus in school. I wish there was a way for you to kindly say something like, &quot;We can cross that far away bridge when we come to it. Let&#39;s talk about what our 7.5 year old should be learning now. What do you need to reassure you?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus it sounds like he was on a roll down the slope of fear. People don&#39;t always say perfectly logical things when they are on that scary slope. Sometimes when James gets like that, or I get like that with him, or even Jayn gets into a locked in fear state, all you can do is let the person vent until they run out of steam, without taking any of the statements as serious calls to action, at least not without further examination when you all feel calmer and happier.<br/>\n<br/>\n=== I realized during the long dark night I had alone after this conversation, that if he insists our children go to school, that will eliminate the last reason I have for being married to him.===<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce upon a time there must have been other reasons that you married. I doubt that any person can be happy knowing that the only reason their spouse is staying with them is to use them as support to facilitate home schooling. If anything this makes you more accountable to him for their learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing looks good in a long dark night. There is no situation that benefits from being examined in the emotional pain and inner turmoil and deep, physical drained emptiness of a long dark night. (Obviously I have had some long dark nights in my past life.) How hungry and thirsty and tired were you when you had this realization? How hungry and thirsty and tired were you when you wrote this post?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest that you spend some time - call it part of your deschooling if it helps you - revisiting the early days of your marriage and courtship. Spend some time recalling what attracted you to him in the first place. Look at photos if you have them. Tell your kids the sweet stories about how you met, your first few dates, your wedding day, how you felt when you knew you were pregnant. <br/>\n<br/>\nWrite down everything for which you are grateful. Do this every day. Tell him. Stroke his arm or hold his hand while you tell him. <br/>\n<br/>\nThink of your five senses. Write down at least five things (or memories), at least one for each sense, about your husband that brings you joy or inspires your love. <br/>\n<br/>\nEat enough. Sleep enough. Get outside in the fresh air and sunshine (or shade if it is hot). Go for walks or swims or rides - bikes? horses?<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t focus on an approaching crisis. It will become a self-fulfilling prophesy. Don&#39;t back yourself or him into a corner where saving face becomes more important than saving your family. Consider being still and quiet instead. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt only takes one person to make a difference by changing the whole dynamic. He is still with you, still fighting for you and your marriage.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://craft-it-easy.com\">http://craft-it-easy.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://iggyjingles.blogspot.com\">http://iggyjingles.blogspot.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":187853867,"authorName":"aldq75","from":"&quot;aldq75&quot; &lt;aldq75@...&gt;","profile":"aldq75","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Unsupportive partner - situation approaching crisis","postDate":"1349482231","msgId":69271,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGs0bnN0bitpMXRwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGs0bm5qdSszdGg3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69270,"nextInTopic":69272,"prevInTime":69270,"nextInTime":69272,"topicId":69265,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Don t expect him to learn by reading - this is life, not school!

You could make between now and then as fantastic as you could--super fun stuff for the whole family--musuems, water parks, visiting new cities and relatives, festivals, living history events, whole-house forts, cool toys, puppet shows, big art projects, theater matinees, hikes through the woods, whatever the whole 9 yards looks like for your family. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour husband may relax into the experiences knowing that school would be coming, but meanwhile, you would be having a really great time together, learning together, and that would be something to build on in the future.

I think if you set your husband up for a switcheroo, it could make things way worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-I have been unschooling my children Miriam (5.5) and Lydia (7.5) since before they were born.

I literally couldn&#39;t face the idea of even having children until I found out about unschooling. It&#39;s always been pretty great, and recently it has become even better as I realized I was &quot;fake&quot; unschooling food, and dropped that burden.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has never shown much interest in learning about childhood development or educational theories, but he has been willing to go along with what I wanted to do. His attitude came across as &quot;You want to do this thing, so you do it.&quot; I gave up asking him to read things a long time ago because he wouldn&#39;t read them. It seems like I made a really big mistake in giving up on that, but it hurt so much to get rejected over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realized recently, after a very uncomfortable conversation with my husband, that he thinks unschooling is bullshit and always has. He demanded that I convince him that our children are learning. I told him that I wished he would read some about unschooling (I was thinking of Sandra&#39;s site), and he said something like &quot;just because I didn&#39;t read that guy&#39;s book&quot;, and I asked &quot;What guy?&quot; and he said &quot;John Holt!&quot; and in a voice dripping with contempt, started to describe John Taylor Gatto. He described the idea that children can learn without being taught as &quot;ridiculous&quot;. He demanded to know how our 7.5 yo was going to learn calculus. He complained that he didn&#39;t know what to say when his parents asked what our kids were doing. He belittled our children&#39;s interests. He worried aloud about strangers thinking our 7.5 yo is &quot;slow&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sent him <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/tv\">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a> to read over, and the only response I got from him were snarky comments about the Carl Sagan quote.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, my husband has not deschooled, and in fact has absolutely no interest in doing so, or reading any of the arguments for the benefit of doing so. If he insists that our children go to school, I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any way I&#39;ll be able to stop it, considering the state&#39;s position on schooling. I realized during the long dark night I had alone after this conversation, that if he insists our children go to school, that will eliminate the last reason I have for being married to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I go forward from here?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69341,"nextTopicId":69330}}
