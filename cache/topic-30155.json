Visualization helped me helped me learn the butterfly swim stroke <br/>\nwhen I was in my mid- twenties.  I would study and watch good <br/>\nbutterflyers on my masters swim team.  I would watch them under the <br/>\nwater and above the water.  Then I would visualize myself doing it.  I <br/>\nwould imagine my body undulating and my arms coming out of the water.  I <br/>\nwould think about my body doing this all day long.  I perfected the <br/>\nstroke in a short amount of time.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  As the center forward on my women&#39;s soccer team, I visualized the <br/>\nball going past the goalie and into the goal before I kicked my goal <br/>\nkicks which almost always went in.  My coach taught me to do this, and <br/>\nit really worked.  I was the top scorer on my team!
