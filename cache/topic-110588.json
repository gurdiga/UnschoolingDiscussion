So I&#39;m not a journal keeper, right now.  It often jumps into my head though, that I want to do one.

This was when I was first letting go of definitions of that word and letting go of a lot of schooly thinking. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m quite a bit different now. lol<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I maybe kept going on the journal for about a week and,,,  wow!  It showed me so much.  When I totally thought we weren&#39;t doing anything, we were actually doing a ton. :D  At the time I was just starting to research unschooling.  In my school mind we weren&#39;t doing anything, in the broader mind set--the more open and accepting unschooling mind set--I saw how much we really were doing! <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Keeping that journal was really a catalyst for me to trust my children.
