He is a self-made <br/>\npianist and composer. You can find the link to Lennon&#39;s site on my new page &quot;Aldort Kids&quot; on my site. Or, you can go directly to www  dot  LennonAldort  dot  com. ......<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ............Amazon review:<br/>\nLennon Aldort&#39;s debut CD is a collection of seven solo piano improvisations, invented on the spot during the recording sessions. Lennon began playing the piano at the age of three, and has never had any lessons on the instrument. He developed his improvisational technique on his own, and his music is flowing with rich melodies and harmonies that come directly from the fingers and spirit of this amazing youth. He has been compared to Rachmaninoff, Keith Jarrett and George Winston.<br/>\n<br/>\nLennon is an amazing example of growing up in freedom. .........<br/>\n  ............ Read his blogs on myspace if you want to meet the philosopher side of Lennon. He is amazing. He played piano on his own by ear since age three and a half (when he played by ear Bach, Mozart, Beethoven and more). Lennon was never coerced to do anything. Now, at 17, he makes a good income performing piano improvisations, arranging and composing, composing for film, fixing Mac computers, and now, selling his CDs. Lennon has already done the school of BK and her relationships workshop, the landmark forum, and he has traveled and communicates with friends world wide, from peers to film directors like Milos Forman (Amadeus). I watch him with delight and excitement for the gifts he is to the world and I love sharing his gifts with you&quot;<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Alex Polikowsky<br/>\n  polykow.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34575,"nextTopicId":34632}}
