When the child becomes difficult to<br/>\n&quot;handle&quot;  they go to the doc and try to medicate the &quot;problem&quot; away...or at<br/>\nleast put the child as the center of the problem....it couldn&#39;t be the<br/>\nparents!  (PLEASE NOTE:  I mean no offense to anyone with a genuine problem<br/>\nor diagnosis....and yes,  I do think it can be a real issue.  I&#39;m just<br/>\ntrying to say that some who fit into Lynda&#39;s &#39;third category&#39;  may think of<br/>\ncommon childhood behavior as too much of a crimp in their lifestyle)<br/>\nsheesh,  I&#39;m tired and so are the three whiny ones coming to hang on<br/>\nme....TTFN,<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a third category we use to see where I worked.  They were usually<br/>\nfrom upper middle class and well to do families.  It was like the parents<br/>\nhad kids because it was the thing to do and then they ignored them.  Kinda<br/>\nlike some folks buy pets and then ignore them.  And then when there was a<br/>\nproblem, it was &quot;I just don&#39;t understand&quot; and &quot;How can he/she/they do this<br/>\nto me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5047879,"authorName":"Joseph Fuerst","from":"&quot;Joseph Fuerst&quot; &lt;fuerst@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: random musings","postDate":"1008387976","msgId":29927,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNzIwMWMxODUxYiQwYzcwOTMwMCRlYTg5ODUwYUBwYXZpbGlvbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwMDgzODQ2MTQuMzAyOTguMjk4NjcubTEyQHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":29929,"prevInTime":29926,"nextInTime":29928,"topicId":29927,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I hope your thinking is correct on this.

Theya ll seem to fall into<br/>\n&gt; two categories . . . those who came from poor innercity places where<br/>\n&gt; drinking and drugs were an escape of sorts and a way to cope the<br/>\n&gt; otehr type are those who come from mid to upper-class homes where<br/>\n&gt; they were expected to be exactly what the parents wanted or the<br/>\n&gt; parents were very authoritarian or who were never shown love, only<br/>\n&gt; given stuff and money.<br/>\n&gt; But I can&#39;t think of a simgle person who had parents who were<br/>\n&gt; interrested in them but not in a controlling way who went on to have<br/>\n&gt; these problems.<br/>\n&gt; But I can only say that in anecdotal at best and can&#39;t be used as a<br/>\n&gt; complete model of reality.  It is truly just what I see around me and<br/>\n&gt; have experienced in the past.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bridget </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29888,"nextTopicId":29884}}
