You will get a lot of responses, and I know you<br/>\nwill be able to find some way of explaining it in your own words.  When<br/>\npeople asked my husband how we know our kids learn without tests, I<br/>\npointed him to a quote of John Holt in How Children Learn. &quot;We do not<br/>\nneed to keep picking away at their minds to make sure they are learning. <br/>\nWhat we need to do, and all we need to do, is bring as much of the world<br/>\nas we can into the school and the classroom{home}; give children as much<br/>\nhelp and guidance as they need and ask for; listen respectfully when they<br/>\nfeel like talking; and then get out of the way.  We can trust them to do<br/>\nthe rest.&quot;  I say &quot;I homeschool&quot; to avoid unnecessary confusion about<br/>\nunschooling.  But when they question me, my canned response is, &quot;well,<br/>\nthey pursue their own interests and I help them along the way.&quot;  When<br/>\nthey ask if the children are learning the basic curriculum, I say, &quot;in<br/>\nthe process of learning they become well rounded.&quot;  You might say that<br/>\nyour son gets most of his education using the internet and playing<br/>\neducational games.  I know it&#39;s sort of b.s., but so is what they are<br/>\nthinking when they ask such things.  I guess what I am saying is more of<br/>\na response to someone you don&#39;t trust or don&#39;t know well enough to be<br/>\nentirely forthcoming with.  But John Holt&#39;s quote isn&#39;t b.s. for those<br/>\npeople who really are interested in knowing how to unschool.<br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":91247465,"authorName":"lavonneellis","from":"&quot;lavonneellis&quot; &lt;lavonne@...&gt;","profile":"lavonneellis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: introducing myself","postDate":"1014658994","msgId":32142,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE1ZHQzaSt1bnJiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxZTYwMWMxYmUwMyRjMTk2MGJlMCQxNDU5ZTgzZkBwc2Ftbz4="},"prevInTopic":32140,"nextInTopic":32143,"prevInTime":32141,"nextInTime":32143,"topicId":32137,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... computer ... various ... to surf ... coordination, and ...

I, too, have received a lot of questions over the years.  The best way to respond that I&#39;ve<br/>\nfound is to tell the person asking that we compile our learning around each child&#39;s individual<br/>\nneeds.  They usually don&#39;t know exactly what that means and they feel embarrassed to ask any more<br/>\nquestions.  I&#39;ve learned I don&#39;t have to go into any great detail.  As for socialization, my<br/>\nchildren are involved in various musical lessons and Church so I tell people they are very happy<br/>\nwith our situation.  That being a &quot;joiner&quot; isn&#39;t important to them.  I hope this helps.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\nwhere you are and still am getting the questions after 5 years.
