Would you mind sharing? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s see, the most basic of books for me is the Tao Te Ching. (I use <br/>\nthe Jane English translation.) I get something new each time I look <br/>\nthere. I also have some books interpreting the Tao such as The Tao of <br/>\nPooh by Hoff (pretty simple) and Embarking on The Way by Solala <br/>\nTowler (a little more in-depth.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI love to read anything from The Dalai Lama and especially like a <br/>\nsimple little book of his called The Dalai Lama&#39;s Book of Wisdom. I <br/>\nalso have one called The Art of Happiness that I haven&#39;t finished yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a great book on mindful parenting called Everday Blessings by <br/>\nJon and Myla Kabat-Zinn. Their descriptions of mindfullness at work <br/>\nin our lives and our parenting has been very helpful to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy most recent read and my current favorite is The Power of NOW by <br/>\nEckhardt Tolle.
