Any time that any part of your lifestyle is<br/>\noutside the norm you find yourself making explanations and qualifications<br/>\nto others on a regular basis.  You may run into other who expect you to<br/>\ndefend your choices, or those who are truly interested in learning more<br/>\nabout you and your choices, or those who want to follow your lead.<br/>\nWhatever the case may be, you end up getting pretty old hat with your<br/>\nresponses, and even sometimes getting &quot;on a roll&quot; with your answer and<br/>\nending up sounding more passionate than the situation may find appropriate.<br/>\n Then one can sound very &quot;preachy&quot; indeed.
