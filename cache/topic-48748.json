HPV is a generic term that more than 60 viruses fall <br/>\nunder. They are responsible for warts anywhere on the body. Although only <br/>\nsome are sexually transmitted. (genital or venereal warts) You can treat, but <br/>\nnot cure them. Some people (25-35%?) get the visual sign of warts, but many <br/>\nnever show the wart symptom. Some believe that it is the subclinical versions <br/>\nthat are linked to cancer. That is why pap smears are so important. The warts <br/>\nappear on the vulva, in or around the vagina, anus, on the cervix, anywhere <br/>\non the groin and thighs, and sometimes in the mouth. (penis and scrotum for <br/>\nmen) The warts can be raised or flat, small or large, single or clumped in a <br/>\ngroup. (look like a little head of cauliflower) Normally they are <br/>\nflesh-colored and painless. (also pinkish or gray) Spread by skin to skin <br/>\ncontact, interring through tiny breaks in the skin. Once you get it, it could <br/>\ntake months or years for it to come back to the surface, if at all. There is <br/>\nno blood test for it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHerpes (HSV-1 and HSV-2) is part of the family of viruses that causes chicken <br/>\npox, shingles, and infectious mononucleosis. HSV-1 is what causes cold sores, <br/>\nfever blisters and the like. It can be the cause of sores in the genital <br/>\narea, but usually those are caused by HSV-2. There is no cure, but there are <br/>\ndrugs to treat a breakout. The virus lives in nerve cells at the base of the <br/>\nspine and creeps to the surface once in a while. The outbreak looks like <br/>\nblisters. Most people who have the disease don&#39;t even know it because they <br/>\nhave no symptoms. It is thought that some 20% of genital herpes is spread by <br/>\noral sex. (that is a person can have genital herpes in the mouth, just like <br/>\nthey can have the HSV-1 in the genitals) There is a blood test for herpes. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, syphilis, and chancroid, neither is a <br/>\nreportable disease, so if you have it, either you or your doctor will (or <br/>\nwon&#39;t) discover it. You won&#39;t be getting calls from the health department. <br/>\n<br/>\nHerpes looks like blisters, and HPV looks like warts. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy who is sorry for the confusion. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96795689,"authorName":"tuckervill@aol.com","from":"tuckervill@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] s*x and adults and a side topic","postDate":"1036076564","msgId":48889,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4Mi4xMTIzYzJhMC4yYWYyYTAxNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48888,"nextInTopic":48899,"prevInTime":48888,"nextInTime":48890,"topicId":48748,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/31/2002 8:52:38 AM Central Standard Time, ...
