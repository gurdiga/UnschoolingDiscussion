I&#39;ll spare you the smarmy details, but suffice it to say that as I read your post I could say that sounds familiar...  so the situation was similar.<br/>\n  We pretty much cut off all contact.  We didn&#39;t announce this, we didn&#39;t explain, we just chose to protect our kids from her.  When she called and invited we were not available.  We certainly never called her.  She did send some angry emails about this to my husband who just said sorry your offended, but we just don&#39;t want to come over.  No explanations, no fight, no fuss.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;   <br/>\n  I know this is hard.  I also know that these kind of relationships ruin holidays.  You and your family deserve the chance to enjoy them in peace.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Ann*****<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDarin and I have done the same thing with his mom. After the kids spent a few weeks with her last Easter time, we have cut off all contact with her. I, like you could go on and on about her nasty ways. Her treatment of Darin growing up, her treatment of our kids and Darin&#39;s sister&#39;s children, lets just say it has always sucked. And she doesn&#39;t have an addiction to help explain her toxic ways, she is just a nasty person. (not to say that an addiction is an excuse)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe, rather Darin has not yet explained to his mom why he has decided not to talk to her any more. He also has received the &#39;Why don&#39;t you... I don&#39;t understand... I&#39;ve always been there for you... You are being ungrateful... I know its your wife who has put you up to this...&#39; emails. But I want to say this about how you say you all have handled your situation AND how Darin has handled his situation. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is my opinion that at some point in time the person in question needs to be told, somehow (letter, phone call, face to face, doesn&#39;t matter), the reasons behind the cut-off. The telling doesn&#39;t need to be nice or kind, but neither does it need to be mean and nasty. It can be short and to the point, mincing no words, and then nothing more need be said. In our case I don&#39;t feel it is my place to tell my MIL all the whys. It wouldn&#39;t be good coming from me anyway. In your case the telling should probably come from your husband. Remember this is just my opinion, but I do think this needs to be done. How else can the person change? Not to say that they will have the light-bulb-over-the-head breakthrough, but who&#39;s to say they won&#39;t? And I&#39;m also not saying that said person should be told because they deserve to be told either. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our case, Darin has, in the past month or so, voiced his need/want to tell his mom why he has cut her off, but has said that he doesn&#39;t think he can fully explain. He also thinks he won&#39;t be as articulate as he knows/thinks (?) he needs to be. I&#39;ve only told Darin my opinion once, left it at that, and that I will support his decisions. I think his current need comes from the fact that we have moved so far away, that by not talking to his mom he is also not talking to siblings (although that one is probably not as important, since the siblings have never been close), and mostly, because we are going to have another baby in the spring. (And there are tons of issues with that! Enough for two posts at least! &lt;bwg&gt;) I told him that when he is ready we can make a list together. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he will say something like; Mom, this is why I don&#39;t talk to you anymore, and follow that statement with a bullet point list of the reasons. And then explain until things change the current situation will remain unchanged. I don&#39;t know, I probably won&#39;t be as articulate as the situation demands either, but together we should be able to write a letter that gets the point across. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143188961,"authorName":"Ann","from":"Ann &lt;ann_mv05@...&gt;","profile":"ann_mv05","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Relationships","postDate":"1133208109","msgId":110287,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMTI4MjAwMTUwLjY4NzEucW1haWxAd2ViNTM0MTQubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDFlYS40OGNhMGEyNy4zMGJjYTNhZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":110283,"nextInTopic":110289,"prevInTime":110286,"nextInTime":110288,"topicId":16558,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh, she definately knew WHY.

Even in her nastly emails she would say stuff like Just because I....., or I know I said ....... She would minimize the evil stuff she did and make it seem like we were over-protective parents.  Her perception of our parenting is of no interest to us, still I supppose she could have chosen to change.  I just did not see it to be my job to help her change.  She is a grown up, she  had a mother and I&#39;m not her:0) ...just kidding.   But I will easily admit that we didn&#39;t try to fix her or help her see it from our point of view or do anything to facillitate her changing.  We didn&#39;t want to.  It wasn&#39;t worth it to my husband.  It wasn&#39;t worth it to me either.  I believe she would have only sucked up precious family time in some way.  We don&#39;t have any regrets.  I do understand that this would not be the right approach for many people, but it brought a lot of peace to us. <br/>\n   I realize in discussing this that any relationship that interefered with my kids&#39; peace and joy wold be a relationship I would view as not being worth my time or theirs (meaning my kids).  I try to surround myself both in person and online only with those who embrace or at least tolerate our unschooling philosophy.

The mother to my nieces is not a nice person.  When I have my niece over, she calls and demands that she be brought back.  It is an abusive situation in my opinion (not the kind you report, just the kind that could stand a lot of improvement from an unschooling perspective).<br/>\n<br/>\nI changed my phone number over the weekend so she couldn&#39;t call my anymore.

If you decide to see them some, maybe you set the boundary that if they want to see you THEY must come to your house but they have to sleep at a hotel.  Then they can decide if they want to do that or not.  Maybe the boundary is that you only meet for dinner in a public place...whatever, if they don&#39;t like the boundary that you set to protect your kids, that is their problem.

So <br/>\n  he sits by and watches trying not to say anything and ever so <br/>\n  politely hating every minute of the visit.  It is unfair to him as <br/>\n  well.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As I am typing this I am wondering if people who didn&#39;t grow up with <br/>\n  this type of manipulation in their lives even really understand it.  <br/>\n  In my case I want to see it each time it arises so that I can deal <br/>\n  with it better.  I want to see it for what it is and and respond to <br/>\n  it in a way that shows my children that it is good to stand up for <br/>\n  what you believe in and not be persuaded by a manipulative <br/>\n  relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well it made sense in my head, we&#39;ll see if ya&#39;ll can make sense of <br/>\n  it as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Dana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    SPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n          Graduate school education   High school education   Home school education     Middle school education   New york school education   School education in california <br/>\n      <br/>\n  ---------------------------------<br/>\n    YAHOO!

When I was a kid  <br/>\nand made a mistake, like spilling a glass of pop, it was proof that I  <br/>\nwas all sorts of bad things.

He pulled  <br/>\ndown his pants but forgot to pull down his underwear, and they got  <br/>\nsoaked, and he made a puddle on the floor to boot. He called out to  <br/>\nme, &quot;Mama, I made a little mistake. I&#39;m going to need some clean  <br/>\nunderwear and some rags.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBringing him the underwear and rags, and helping him clean up, I felt  <br/>\nlike I had made the game-winning touchdown in the last two seconds of  <br/>\nthe playoffs. Through my behavior to him his whole life, I have  <br/>\nwanted him to learn that making a mistake is no big deal; that almost  <br/>\nall mistakes can be corrected; that he has the know-how to correct  <br/>\nthem, and that we will help him as well; that he will not lose our  <br/>\naffection or respect by making mistakes. Woo-hoo!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter we&#39;d gotten everything cleaned up, he said, &quot;Next time, I&#39;ll  <br/>\nmake sure to remember to take my underwear off, too,&quot; and ran off to  <br/>\nplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes now if I make a mistake, he will tell me, &quot;It&#39;s OK, Mama.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s no big deal!

When I <br/>\nstarted, I wasn&#39;t pregnant; my brother was in a residential treatment home for <br/>\ntroubled teens, and I had this very badly broken leg in a very large cast.
