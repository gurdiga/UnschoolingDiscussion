And so like Power Ranger&#39;s <br/>\naction sequences, the flora would be all very foreign willowy stuff we don&#39;t have <br/>\nhere, and trees I&#39;ve never seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had built for their sets two wild-west bars and a log cabin.   The log <br/>\ncabin looked great from the outside.  Big porch, nice roof, good job.  Like <br/>\nthey learned about log cabins watching Bonanza.   On the inside they had it <br/>\nfurnished like the 1950&#39;s, like they learned about American houses watching Leave <br/>\nit to Beaver.  Not lots of furniture, just a stuffed living room chair, a <br/>\nlittle table and an electric lamp, I think.  I&#39;d really like to see it again <br/>\nbecause that day I was just in shock.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the bars had its name on the wall in rope, nailed into &quot;Saloon&quot; maybe <br/>\nor some word that looked good in cursive.    The other one had river rocks <br/>\nglued to the wooden wall.   I don&#39;t know what they were to have had, in Arizona <br/>\nin 1870 or whenever, that would have glued one-pound rocks to vertical wood.  I <br/>\nneed to see it again!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the lines in the dubbed dialog was &quot;I&#39;m sleeping with my grandfather.&quot; <br/>\n  It&#39;s an idiom they might&#39;ve avoided.  The question was &quot;Where have you been <br/>\nstaying?&quot; I think.  It&#39;s been so long.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh--the log cabin, from the inside, besides the furniture with the flat wall <br/>\nbehind it (forgot that, there was an inside wall which is no crime by itself, <br/>\nbut I  think it was drywall with wallpaper, which still is feasible but way <br/>\nunlikely), when they turned and the camera was toward the outside wall, they had <br/>\nnot chinked the logs.  You could see daylight through al the spaces between <br/>\nlogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere logs are plentiful and people have some skill with an axe and they have <br/>\ntime, log cabins are build with the wood touching, with the top log grooved <br/>\nto fit over the roundness of the log below.  But out here where logs are NOT so <br/>\nplentiful, it wasn&#39;t too unusual to go for height, and fill in the cracks <br/>\nwith clay.  There are still barns around New Mexico built that way (little sheds, <br/>\nmore like, abandoned here and there along little state roads).    <br/>\n<br/>\nBut these guys didn&#39;t know that, so their logs had  no fill.   So their big <br/>\nnice house was constructed more like a picnic shelter in a national park.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that&#39;s familiar to anyone, I&#39;d love to just buy a copy.   It&#39;s possibly <br/>\nonly on real-big movie, and not on video or DVD, I suppose.  Maybe I could <br/>\ninquire at the local TV station, which might&#39;ve owned a copy and still, maybe.  <br/>\nThat was in the early 80&#39;s, I think, that we saw it and it was probably 60&#39;s or <br/>\n70&#39;s itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139187074,"authorName":"Julie","from":"&quot;Julie&quot; &lt;mjsolich@...&gt;","profile":"foxymophandlemama32","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Martial arts movies","postDate":"1093065048","msgId":98597,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzcwMWM0ODczZCQzOWUzMjljMCQwYTYxMWFkM0B5MmYwbzQ+","referencesHeader":"PDQxMUJBNkE3MDBDMkY0MzRAbXgwMS5pcHJpbXVzLmNvbS5hdT4gKGFkZGVkIGJ5IHBvc3RtYXN0ZXJAaXByaW11cy5jb20uYXUp"},"prevInTopic":98504,"nextInTopic":98619,"prevInTime":98596,"nextInTime":98598,"topicId":98438,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*** If you get the HBO stable of channels, keep a look out for a documentary titled Jackie Chan: My Stunts in which he talks about, well, his stunts.
