This includes<br/>\nmy relearning or rethinking what society has brainwashed me with as being<br/>\n&quot;normal or ok&quot; and though I&#39;ll get flamed by the obvious monopoly, I feel I<br/>\nmust say something as the posts below really upset me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt one thing to disagree with someone, but to do so in such a disrespectful<br/>\nand undignified way is really upsetting to me. Where is the peace in this<br/>\ntype of reply? Where is the love & understanding. Intolerance and impatience<br/>\naren&#39;t tools for teaching and I am here to learn.I will make mistakes in my<br/>\nparenting path and I will disagree with people here as we are all not alike<br/>\nnor are our styles of &quot;parenting&quot; and that should all be ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nI shouldn&#39;t feel afraid to post in fear I&#39;ll get slammed by certain members<br/>\nlike Oom. I didn&#39;t feel she was accusing or labeling anyone in particular,<br/>\njust sharing an opinion. So why attack? I&#39;m positive, I too, will get a heap<br/>\nof flaming, but I find this terribly uncomfortable and unfair. I&#39;d be much<br/>\nmore willing to listen to a non-reactionary gentle reply. It&#39;s a bit like<br/>\nthe pot calling the kettle black to accuse of attack and then retaliate by<br/>\nattacking back as well. Non-reaction is an emotionally adult way to handle<br/>\nsuch things, not more insults and accusations or assumptions. Give the topic<br/>\nup Oom, you don&#39;t have a chance. You&#39;ve already been hung before tried. I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen it happen before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the 5th time I&#39;ve been too intimidated to post because of this type<br/>\nof reaction. I honestly don&#39;t think Oom was name calling, etc... She is on<br/>\nanother list that I have been on and appears to be a gentle soul.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan&#39;t we agree to disagree on certain subject, treat each other with respect<br/>\nand dignity?<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you all well. I doubt I&#39;ll post after this out of fear. I feel<br/>\nterrible about this as I still have many many questions and came seeking<br/>\nhelp on many issues as I feel very alone in our unschooling journey. It&#39;s a<br/>\nshame a few ruin it for the many. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to all and PEACE,<br/>\nJeva<br/>\n<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nSince you know SO much and seem to dislike this list SO much, what&#39;s the<br/>\ndeal?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your way is working great for you, just go do it!  Because your<br/>\ncommentary<br/>\nand advice aren&#39;t adding to unschooling peace and prosperity.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 7/20/03 1:42:23 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:OomYaaqub@...\">OomYaaqub@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  The word actually means slower<br/>\nin development. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nActually?<br/>\n<br/>\nHuh.<br/>\n<br/>\nWE KNOW THAT.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you used it of boys in general and it seemed of your boys in particular.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107898,"nextTopicId":107872}}
