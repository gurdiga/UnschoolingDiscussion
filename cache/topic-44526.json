I think a very important<br/>\ndistinction is that the kids unschool themselves and I basically try to<br/>\nremove obstacles from their paths.  Those obstacles are usually me, sadly<br/>\nenough.  Me wishing the house was cleaner, wanting to be &quot;in control&quot;,<br/>\nslipping back into &quot;school mindset&quot;.  But it is getting easier and easier to<br/>\nstay in a joyful place with the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that I am often surprised at what the kids have figured out<br/>\nwithout me even being aware of it.  Like today, Marsie, 5, was showing me<br/>\nhow she can do Reader Rabbit.  I have never &quot;worked with her on&quot; letters and<br/>\ntheir sounds, just simply answered her questions about them as they were<br/>\nasked.  I didn&#39;t know that she knew the lower case letters at all until this<br/>\nmorning.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling with several small children makes for lots of chaos, but lots of<br/>\nlaughs as well.  Example of today: Got up early and dh and kids helped load<br/>\na goat and 2 dogs up to go to the vet.  Came home and dh and Zach (9) went<br/>\nto the batting cages.  Zach talked quite a bit about the differences<br/>\ninvolved in batting at different speeds.  Marsie (5), Danny (3) and Michelle<br/>\n(3) watched &quot;Monsters, Inc&quot; and had lunch.  I went to the library and picked<br/>\nup Adriane (11) from a slumber party.  Zach and dh worked in the yard with<br/>\nZach mowing independently on the riding mower.  The three little guys made<br/>\nmud pies and Adriane watched CMT, asking lots of questions about Waylon<br/>\nJennings.  I went to the grocery store and they were all swimming when I got<br/>\nback.  Danny came to help carry groceries.  Marsie showed her Dad and I how<br/>\nfar she had got on Reader Rabbit.  All the males worked to fix the grill and<br/>\nwe cooked hamburgers.  Dh and Zach changed a tire.  The little kids went<br/>\nswinging and playing on the huge dirt pile while Zach used a stick to gather<br/>\npecans from our tree.  Adriane, Zach and I went to milk the goats.  We did<br/>\nthe math and figured Zach&#39;s goat was big enough to breed so we put her in<br/>\nwith the male.  Adriane figured out how much milk she got in pounds for her<br/>\n4-H records.  The kids fed their rabbits and dogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nChaotic and busy, but also fun and very &quot;educational&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44518,"nextTopicId":44525}}
