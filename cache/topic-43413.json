But not just random friends. <br/>\nHomeschoolers have the opportunity to for selective socialization. Parents <br/>\ncan guide their children to other Christian families with like minded morals <br/>\nand values. Most home school families I know are are very active with other <br/>\nfamilies. There are weekly field trips with support groups, twice a week <br/>\nchurch functions, scouts, choir, weekly skating parties, etc, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n[then there&#39;s a cartoon and some statistics]<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Does God&#39;s Word Say About Who we Socialize With?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concept of separation from evil is fundamental to God’s relationship with <br/>\nHis people. According to the Bible, separation evolves two dimensions-one <br/>\nnegative and one positive:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  separating yourself morally and spiritually from sin and everything that <br/>\nis contrary to Jesus Christ, righteous and God’s Word.<br/>\n2.  drawing near to God in a close intimate fellowship thorough dedication, <br/>\nworship and service.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDon Stamp commentary explains in the Full Life Bible:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  In the Old Testament separation was an ongoing requirement for God’s <br/>\npeople. (Ex 23:24; Lev. 20:22-26; Isa 52:11;) They were expected to be holy, <br/>\ndifferent and separated from other peoples in order to belong to God as His <br/>\nvery own.<br/>\n2.  In the New Testament God commanded separation of the believer (a) from <br/>\nthe corrupt world system and from unholy compromise. (b) from those in church <br/>\nwho sin and refuse to repent (Mat 7:15; 1Co 5:9-11; 2Th 3:6-15) and from <br/>\nfalse teachers, churches or cults that teach theological error and deny <br/>\nBiblical truths (Mat 7:15; Rom 16:17)<br/>\n3.  Our attitude in separation must be one of (a) hatred toward sin, <br/>\nunrighteousness and the corrupt world system, (b) opposition to false <br/>\ndoctrine, © genuine love towards whom we must separate. and (d) fear of God <br/>\nas we perfect holiness.<br/>\n4.  The purpose of separation is that we as God’s people might (a) persevere <br/>\nin salvation (1Ti 4:16; Rev 12:14-17), faith (1Ti 1:19; 6:10; 20-21) and <br/>\nholiness (Jo 17:14-21; 2Cor 7:1) (b) live wholly for God as our Lord and <br/>\nFather (Mat 22:37; 2Co 6:16-18) and convince the unbelieving world of the <br/>\ntruth and blessings of the gospel (Jn 17:21; Phi. 2:15.)<br/>\n5.  If we separate ourselves properly, God Himself rewards us by drawing near <br/>\nwith His protection, blessing and Fatherly care. He promises to be everything <br/>\na good Father should be. He will be our counselor, guide; He will love and <br/>\ncherish us as His own children. (2Cor 6:16-18)<br/>\n6.  The refusal of believers to separate themselves from evil will <br/>\ninevitability result in loss of fellowship with God (2 Co 6:16), of <br/>\nacceptance by the Father (6:17) and of our rights as children (6:18cf. Rom <br/>\n8:15-16).<br/>\n<br/>\n[end of quoted section]<br/>\n----------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn an article in the new Home Education Magazine, Liza Sabater was describing <br/>\nthe package and way of life school becomes for people:   &quot;With school come <br/>\nfriends and peers; elders and role models; the time for learning and the time <br/>\nfor doing everything else.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see from the separatist information above, That packaged way of <br/>\nlife is enforced on Christian Homeschoolers, and their &quot;package&quot; is much <br/>\nsmaller than it would be if the kids were in school.  They DO give their <br/>\nchildren a pre-determined set of friends, peers, elders and role models.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"fundus/fundi/fundies","postDate":"1031579553","msgId":43413,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhOS44MWNjOTllLjJhYWUwMWExQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43428,"prevInTime":43412,"nextInTime":43414,"topicId":43413,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/9/02 7:14:22 AM, dcannon@nctc.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-260789371\">In a message dated 9/9/02 7:14:22 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dcannon@...\">dcannon@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Running together Christianity and fundamentalism is like running<br/>\ntogether snakes and venomous  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell when I&#39;m talking about fundamentalist Christians I&#39;m talking about <br/>\nvenomous snakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not MY idea or my imagination that fundamentalist Christians don&#39;t <br/>\nconsider Catholics to be Christians (nor do most of them consider Lutherans <br/>\nor Episcopalians, etc. to be &quot;true Christians.&quot;  They teach that they&#39;ll be <br/>\nburning in hell with the other heathens unless one of them somehow, against <br/>\nhis church&#39;s teaching, actually somehow had a personal relationship with <br/>\nJesus and was born again.

Does the Bible have anything to say to NAFTA, The United <br/>\nNations, or most favored nation status of China? Does the Bible have anything <br/>\nto say to welfare reform, Social Security, or national health care? For the <br/>\n2nd generation of homeschoolers to advance on the other fronts of attack <br/>\nagainst the family, church, and nation, they must have the answers to these <br/>\nquestions, they must have them based on the objective truth of God&#39;s Word, <br/>\nand they must be able to articulate them convincingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-To fail to equip our children to give a rational and comprehensive answer <br/>\nto the questions is to dress our children for war and send them out with no <br/>\nbullets. Their best hope is to be captured and allowed to live as prisoners <br/>\nof war. By no means will the complaining and accusations of the unregenerate <br/>\nbe put to rest short of the final judgement, but that fact does not relieve <br/>\nthe Christian of his duty to be ready with a reasoned response and, <br/>\ntherefore, be faithful to equip each succeeding generation of covenant <br/>\nchildren to do the same.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy &quot;Christian&quot; and &quot;covenant,&quot; they mean precisely those who believe just as <br/>\nthey do.<br/>\nAnd by &quot;reasoned&quot; they mean memorized.<br/>\nAnd by &quot;objective&quot; they mean straight from their propaganda.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI lately got the Christian Book Distrubors catalog (Christianbook.com) and if <br/>\nyou think they think all Christians are equal, go peek.  The whole paper <br/>\ncatalog is enough material to fill a house, easily, and there are even action <br/>\nfigures:  Bibleman, Luxor Spandroth, Biblegirl, Cypher, and El Furioso.  You <br/>\ncan get videos featuring their adventures.  (page 60 of the catalog, I&#39;m <br/>\ncertainly not making this up)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey hope to enable Christian homeschooling families to &quot;live apart&quot; meaning <br/>\nto be separate from other kinds of people, even from others who &#39;claim&#39; to be <br/>\nChristian.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an adverstisement for a wall cross.

Or even Canadian Baptists.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey do have a Catholic section, and the http: shows it as a specialty <br/>\nsubgroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey also have a section on Cults.  Specifically  named right on that page:   <br/>\nMormons and Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses.   Here&#39;s a quote from a book review, also <br/>\nfront page:  &quot;detailed information about how cults twist particular <br/>\nscriptures for their own purpose. More importantly, however, this book shows <br/>\nwhy the meanings that cults apply to particular verses are wrong, and why <br/>\nthey contradict orthodox Christianity. Armed with this knowledge, each and <br/>\nevery Christian will be able to stand against the arguments offered by <br/>\nmembers of cults as they try to to proselytize us. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are probably anti-Catholic sections in some of those books.  <br/>\nAnti-Catholic messages were common in our church when I was growing up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now they&#39;re claiming ownership of homeschooling in the U.S.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42923,"nextTopicId":43308}}
