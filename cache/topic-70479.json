I always wish I could hand out copies oF The teenage <br/>\nLiberation Handbook!! My daughter has alot of friends that are now going to <br/>\nthe adult High School at the Community College instead of the public high <br/>\nschool. They needed out and we found other options for them. She wanted to look <br/>\ninto getting a diploma at the time, she wanted to go into psychology. A year <br/>\nlater, she has read every library book on the subject and taken the college <br/>\npsychology class and the anatomy class, and I don&#39;t hear another word of it. She has <br/>\nmoved on. I think she isn&#39;t even interested in more free college <br/>\nclasses...but you never know what will pop up next!  She is extremely self motivated, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t direct her at all. She volunteers at the local karate school teaching <br/>\nclasses every day. She has no desire to move out in a few months when she turns <br/>\n18, She knows that just being 18 doesn&#39;t make you ready for the world! I tell <br/>\nthem they are welcome to stay til they are ready to leave! Of course they will <br/>\nhave to be considerate of house rules even if they are 18.

When <br/>\ntold that it was all real, they were astonished. One of the more <br/>\nstriking moments in the film is when a lone windscreen wiper <br/>\nblade helicopters through the air, suspended from a  line of <br/>\nmetal twine. &quot;That was the first and last time it worked properly,&quot; <br/>\nrecalls Tony Davidson, of the London-based advertising agency <br/>\nWieden &  Kennedy. &quot;I wanted it to look like ballet.&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; After that, a few yards and several ingenious connections down <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; assembly line, another pair of windscreen wiper blades is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>squirted by an activated washer jet. Because Honda wipers have <br/>\nautomatic sensors that can detect water, they start a crablike <br/>\ncrawl across the floor. It is as though they have come to life.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; As take 300 led to 400 which led to 500, a certain madness <br/>\n </span></blockquote>settled on<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the crew.

Some<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; workers on  the film went whole days without sleep and had to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>be asked<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to stay away from the more delicate parts of the assembly. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Others<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; started to have bad dreams about throttle activator shafts and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>bonnet release cables. When things were going wrong - a tire <br/>\nthat kept trundling off to the left, or a rocker  shaft that kept <br/>\ntoppling over like a tipsy cyclist -the production lads on  the shoot <br/>\nwould start grumbling that &quot;the parts are being very moody <br/>\ntoday&quot;.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Commercial makers are often accustomed to working with <br/>\n </span></blockquote>human prima<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; donnas but no Hollywood starlet, no footballing prodigy or <br/>\n </span></blockquote>showbiz<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; celeb, was ever as troublesome and unpredictable as the con <br/>\n </span></blockquote>rods and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; pulley wheels  and solenoids that Davidson, Steiner and Co <br/>\n </span></blockquote>had to work<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; with. Towards  the end of the production, Olivier Coulhon, the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>first<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; assistant director, had spent so many hours in the darkened <br/>\n </span></blockquote>studio that his skin had turned a  luminous green and his eyes <br/>\nhad sunk deep into his Gallic cheeks.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Antoine Bardou-Jacquet, the commercial&#39;s director, kept <br/>\n </span></blockquote>puffing out his cheeks and whinneying, a note of deranged <br/>\ndespair twitching at the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; corners of  his mouth. Asked how long he had been working <br/>\n </span></blockquote>on the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; commercial, he gave high-pitched giggle and replied: &quot;Five <br/>\n </span></blockquote>years? Or is it eight?&quot; It felt that long.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Two hand-made pre-production Accords - there were only six <br/>\n </span></blockquote>in existence in the entire world - were needed for the exercise, <br/>\none of them being ripped apart and cannibalised to the <br/>\nconsiderable distress of Honda engineers. By the end of the <br/>\nmonths-long production, the film had used so many spare parts <br/>\nthat two articulated lorries were required to take them away.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The idea for the advert derived partly from the old children&#39;s <br/>\n </span></blockquote>game<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Mouse Trap, and from the wacky engineering of Caractacus <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Potts&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; breakfast-making machine in the Sixties film Chitty Chitty Bang <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bang.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The corporate suits at Honda liked the idea immediately, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>despite the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; high costs of production and the fact that it was more than <br/>\n </span></blockquote>twice as<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; long, and therefore twice as pricey, as normal car ads. The <br/>\n </span></blockquote>two-minute<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; version of the ad ran for the first time last Sunday during the<br/>\n&gt; Brazilian Grand Prix, and brought pubgoers across the nation <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wide-eyed speechlessness after  the Manchester United v <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Real Madrid game on Tuesday night.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;It was a painstaking process, a tough experience,&quot; says  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Honda&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; communications manager Matt Coombe, recalling the making <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of  Cog. Some<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of the original ideas, such as one stunt involving an airbag, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>had to be dropped owing to a shortage of new Accord parts or <br/>\nsimply because  they were too hard to set up. And on some <br/>\ntakes the process would go<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; perfectly until agonisingly close to the end. &quot;It was like watching <br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; brilliant footballer weaving his way the whole way through a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>defending<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; team&#39;s players, and then shooting wide right at the end,&quot; says <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Tony<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Davidson.

When told that it was all real, they were astonished. One of the more striking moments in the film is when a lone windscreen wiper blade helicopters through the air, suspended from a  line of metal twine. &quot;That was the first and last time it worked properly,&quot; recalls Tony Davidson, of the London-based advertising agency Wieden &  Kennedy. &quot;I wanted it to look like ballet.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, a few yards and several ingenious connections down the<br/>\nassembly line, another pair of windscreen wiper blades is squirted by an activated washer jet. Because Honda wipers have automatic sensors that can detect water, they start a crablike crawl across the floor. It is as though they have come to life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs take 300 led to 400 which led to 500, a certain madness settled on<br/>\nthe crew. Rob Steiner, the agency producer, started talking about &quot;our<br/>\nfriends, the parts&quot;, but in the slightly menacing tone of a primary<br/>\nschool teacher discussing her charges at the end of a trying day. Some<br/>\nworkers on  the film went whole days without sleep and had to be asked<br/>\nto stay away from the more delicate parts of the assembly. Others<br/>\nstarted to have bad dreams about throttle activator shafts and bonnet release cables. When things were going wrong - a tire that kept trundling off to the left, or a rocker  shaft that kept toppling over like a tipsy cyclist -the production lads on  the shoot would start grumbling that &quot;the parts are being very moody today&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nCommercial makers are often accustomed to working with human prima<br/>\ndonnas but no Hollywood starlet, no footballing prodigy or showbiz<br/>\nceleb, was ever as troublesome and unpredictable as the con rods and<br/>\npulley wheels  and solenoids that Davidson, Steiner and Co had to work<br/>\nwith. Towards  the end of the production, Olivier Coulhon, the first<br/>\nassistant director, had spent so many hours in the darkened studio that his skin had turned a  luminous green and his eyes had sunk deep into his Gallic cheeks.<br/>\nAntoine Bardou-Jacquet, the commercial&#39;s director, kept puffing out his cheeks and whinneying, a note of deranged despair twitching at the<br/>\ncorners of  his mouth. Asked how long he had been working on the<br/>\ncommercial, he gave high-pitched giggle and replied: &quot;Five years? Or is it eight?&quot; It felt that long.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo hand-made pre-production Accords - there were only six in existence in the entire world - were needed for the exercise, one of them being ripped apart and cannibalised to the considerable distress of Honda engineers. By the end of the months-long production, the film had used so many spare parts that two articulated lorries were required to take them away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea for the advert derived partly from the old children&#39;s game<br/>\nMouse Trap, and from the wacky engineering of Caractacus Potts&#39;s<br/>\nbreakfast-making machine in the Sixties film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.<br/>\nThe corporate suits at Honda liked the idea immediately, despite the <br/>\nhigh costs of production and the fact that it was more than twice as<br/>\nlong, and therefore twice as pricey, as normal car ads. The two-minute<br/>\nversion of the ad ran for the first time last Sunday during the<br/>\nBrazilian Grand Prix, and brought pubgoers across the nation to a<br/>\nwide-eyed speechlessness after  the Manchester United v Real Madrid game on Tuesday night.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It was a painstaking process, a tough experience,&quot; says  Honda&#39;s<br/>\ncommunications manager Matt Coombe, recalling the making of  Cog. Some<br/>\nof the original ideas, such as one stunt involving an airbag, had to be dropped owing to a shortage of new Accord parts or simply because  they were too hard to set up. And on some takes the process would go<br/>\nperfectly until agonisingly close to the end. &quot;It was like watching a<br/>\nbrilliant footballer weaving his way the whole way through a defending<br/>\nteam&#39;s players, and then shooting wide right at the end,&quot; says Tony<br/>\nDavidson.  The crew resorted to placing bets on which part of the<br/>\nsequence would go  wrong. Invariably it was the windscreen wipers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the final, 606th take eventually succeeded, there was a stunned<br/>\nsilence around the Paris studio. Then, like shipwrecked mariners finally realising that their ordeal was at an end, the team broke into a careworn  chorus of increasingly defiant cheers and hurrahs.<br/>\n<br/>\nChampagne bottles popped. The cylinder liner had brushed its  nose<br/>\naffectionately against the rocker shaft and the gear wheel cog for the<br/>\nlast time. The interior grab handles and the suspension spring coils had done their bit. A classic was complete. Cog was in the can.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70782,"nextTopicId":70786}}
