I think children don&#39;t have the communication <br/>\nskills of an adult and whining is going to happen. <br/>\nIf you decide to ignore it, chances are the child is going to feel worse, not <br/>\nbetter! And I&#39;m quite sure it won&#39;t cure whining.<br/>\nI say to Sierra &quot;If you could use a different voice I could hear you better&quot; <br/>\nin reference to a whiny sounding voice. But I take the complaint/desire very <br/>\nseriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child that wants a pool and can&#39;t have a pool has LOADS of other options.<br/>\nOur job is to brainstorm ideas with them......<br/>\nSwimming at an indoor public pool, buying a small wading pool (heck, we&#39;ve <br/>\nhad swim time in our teensy kitchen with a wading pool!) having a water fight <br/>\nsomewhere with water guns or water balloons, A large bucket full of water on <br/>\nthe patio or deck to sit and play in, filling the bathtub up SUPER full and <br/>\nputting swim trunks on (covering the floor with towels is helpful to avoid <br/>\nflooding damage :), water play in the kitchen sink....<br/>\nAnyway, you get the idea.<br/>\nThere are always options. Being creative and coming up with solutions to a <br/>\nneed is MUCH more helpful than ignoring a desire.<br/>\nAt the very least you can sympathize and say things like &quot;if I had a magic <br/>\nwand I&#39;d make a pool appear right in our apartment!&quot; <br/>\nFantasize about what it would be like to have a big pool right in the room, <br/>\nor if the streets were canals and you had to swim to the grocery store. Find <br/>\nways to turn the negative into a positive.<br/>\nFollow the flow of electricity! (negative to positive)...:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible <br/>\nspoon;<br/>\nAnd hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>\nmoon.&quot;<br/>\n                                                --The Owl and the Pussycat      <br/>\n                                        Edward Lear</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65724,"nextTopicId":65658}}
