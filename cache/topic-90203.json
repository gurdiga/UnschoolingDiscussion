I had <br/>\nthe staples out today and dd wants to know where they went.<br/>\nOn the unschooling side of things, perhaps this has happened for a reason. As <br/>\nfrom the depths of my despair I found the ability to look inwards,(gag <br/>\nagain). I see that I was avoiding my kids a bit, using the TV, the phone etc to not <br/>\ndo stuff with them and calling it unschooling.I  now am having a great time <br/>\nbeing WITH my kids, we watch TV and play x-box, read, do puzzles, giggle, and <br/>\nlots more. I think I am getting this. I have been reading lots at the message <br/>\nboards, and tho I believed I knew what I was doing, now I know more.<br/>\nDs Tommy, 8, announced that he was not sure he wanted a friend over the other <br/>\nday as he was having fun just being with us, his family, and doing stuff <br/>\ntogether.That is after 1 week without seeing another kid. Pretty cool!!! Of course <br/>\nhe was happy to get together with his buddy, but he is less antsy to always <br/>\nhave friends around. <br/>\nNow aren&#39;t you sorry you asked?
