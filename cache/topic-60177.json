Nope, she will do it in her own good time. &lt;S&gt; And I have\r<br/>\nto defend that now with others. Except for my husband and I,\r<br/>\neveryone is trying to &quot;encourage&quot; her to potty because her cousin\r<br/>\nWho is 8 months is younger is doing it. \r<br/>\nAnyway my husband and I learned from the other two, our family does\r<br/>\nbest when not pushed in to something. She is getting easier to\r<br/>\ncooperate with as she gets a little older. Her sisters {especially\r<br/>\nthe oldest} are learning to make deals with her to make things more\r<br/>\ntolerable.

The thing is, it&#39;s not all her stuff.\r<br/>\n&gt; She takes\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things of Sierra&#39;s and Joseph&#39;s without asking and of course\r<br/>\n&gt; never puts\r<br/>\n&gt; any\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of it away and leaves it all for them or me to clean up. Now I\r<br/>\n&gt; understand\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s all a part of being 2. I let her play and clean it all\r<br/>\n&gt; up. The\r<br/>\n&gt; thing\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is when she takes things that belong to Joseph and Sierra. They\r<br/>\n&gt; get upset\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and if we put things up so she can&#39;t get it, well neight can\r<br/>\n&gt; Joseph and\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sierra. Some things they are willing to do that with, like\r<br/>\n&gt; paints and\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pictures they are working on. But the rest of their things we\r<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t put\r<br/>\n&gt; up.\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s getting to the point where they don&#39;t want her playing with\r<br/>\n&gt; their\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things anymore because of the mess she leaves. Usually they have\r<br/>\n&gt; no\r<br/>\n&gt; problem\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with her playing with their stuff. She doesn&#39;t break anything,\r<br/>\n&gt; just strews\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it about and sometimes misplacing things so they can&#39;t find\r<br/>\n&gt; them.\r<br/>\n&gt; Eventually\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we usually do but not always. I explain to them about her age\r<br/>\n&gt; and they\r<br/>\n&gt; &gt; understand.

Wanting to see the ends<br/>\nand outs of how everything is put together, much more then her<br/>\nsisters ever were. No is not an option.<br/>\nWhen she was a baby I couldn&#39;t keep a diaper on her, ever. Never<br/>\nliked clothes either.  Anytime she had a &quot;doodie&quot; diaper she had it<br/>\noff and if i didn&#39;t catch it right away I got another fine mess. {I<br/>\nkept humor close by} One big mess after another. LOL I thought she<br/>\nmight want to potty train early because she hated a soiled diaper so<br/>\nmuch then. Nope, she will do it in her own good time. &lt;S&gt; And I have<br/>\nto defend that now with others. Except for my husband and I,<br/>\neveryone is trying to &quot;encourage&quot; her to potty because her cousin<br/>\nWho is 8 months is younger is doing it.  <br/>\nAnyway my husband and I learned from the other two, our family does<br/>\nbest when not pushed in to something. She is getting easier to<br/>\ncooperate with as she gets a little older. Her sisters {especially<br/>\nthe oldest} are learning to make deals with her to make things more<br/>\ntolerable. Me relaxing more seems to help. And I have to admit I<br/>\nreally like they wild spirit she has engrained in herself. :)<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummyone24@...\">mummyone24@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; My 2 year old is a little Dennis the Menace.

The thing is, it&#39;s not all her stuff.<br/>\n&gt; She takes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things of Sierra&#39;s and Joseph&#39;s without asking and of course<br/>\n&gt; never puts<br/>\n&gt; any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of it away and leaves it all for them or me to clean up. Now I<br/>\n&gt; understand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s all a part of being 2. I let her play and clean it all<br/>\n&gt; up. The<br/>\n&gt; thing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is when she takes things that belong to Joseph and Sierra. They<br/>\n&gt; get upset<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and if we put things up so she can&#39;t get it, well neight can<br/>\n&gt; Joseph and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sierra. Some things they are willing to do that with, like<br/>\n&gt; paints and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pictures they are working on.

No is not an option.<br/>\nWhen she was a baby I couldn&#39;t keep a diaper on her, ever. Never<br/>\nliked clothes either.  Anytime she had a &quot;doodie&quot; diaper she had it<br/>\noff and if i didn&#39;t catch it right away I got another fine mess. {I<br/>\nkept humor close by} One big mess after another. LOL I thought she<br/>\nmight want to potty train early because she hated a soiled diaper so<br/>\nmuch then. Nope, she will do it in her own good time. &lt;S&gt; And I have<br/>\nto defend that now with others. Except for my husband and I,<br/>\neveryone is trying to &quot;encourage&quot; her to potty because her cousin<br/>\nWho is 8 months is younger is doing it.  <br/>\nAnyway my husband and I learned from the other two, our family does<br/>\nbest when not pushed in to something. She is getting easier to<br/>\ncooperate with as she gets a little older. Her sisters {especially<br/>\nthe oldest} are learning to make deals with her to make things more<br/>\ntolerable. Me relaxing more seems to help.

We asked her 5 times and we always<br/>\nhelps her since her brother makes a mess right along with her.  Sometimes if<br/>\nit gets out of hand I have her play with one thing at a time.  It helps to<br/>\nhave a place for each item. Legos in the bucket, Books, . Small steps one<br/>\nthing at a time so they dont get over welmed. I have also resorted to time<br/>\nout when they both start and it is way out of hand they go to their bed<br/>\nuntil I get things back in a bit of order. 5 min. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"2 yr. old tornado","postDate":"1046900762","msgId":60177,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY4OXYxdWR4Z1N3aGxGSG14WXEwMDAyNDg0ZEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":60279,"prevInTime":60176,"nextInTime":60178,"topicId":60177,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 2 year old is a little Dennis the Menace.

You can track her path all <br/>\naround the house with the path she leaves behind. Has anyone been able to <br/>\nkeep up with a little kid like this who has plenty of resources to choose <br/>\nfrom to spread all around? The thing is, it&#39;s not all her stuff. She takes <br/>\nthings of Sierra&#39;s and Joseph&#39;s without asking and of course never puts any <br/>\nof it away and leaves it all for them or me to clean up. Now I understand <br/>\nthat&#39;s all a part of being 2. I let her play and clean it all up. The thing <br/>\nis when she takes things that belong to Joseph and Sierra. They get upset <br/>\nand if we put things up so she can&#39;t get it, well neight can Joseph and <br/>\nSierra. Some things they are willing to do that with, like paints and <br/>\npictures they are working on. But the rest of their things we can&#39;t put up. <br/>\nIt&#39;s getting to the point where they don&#39;t want her playing with their <br/>\nthings anymore because of the mess she leaves. Usually they have no problem <br/>\nwith her playing with their stuff. She doesn&#39;t break anything, just strews <br/>\nit about and sometimes misplacing things so they can&#39;t find them. Eventually <br/>\nwe usually do but not always. I explain to them about her age and they <br/>\nunderstand. It&#39;s just not fair for them and as much as I watch her, well she <br/>\ngets into many things anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
