The water should be hot enough to take a<br/>\n&gt; bath in, but not hot enough to scald. Cover with<br/>\n&gt; plastic wrap an stand in a warm place for about ten<br/>\n&gt; minutes. During this time the liquid should develop<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; foamy head, showing that the yeast is dissolved and<br/>\n&gt; happy.. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sift flour, milk and salt into another bowl, and mix<br/>\n&gt; well. (NB. Please resist the temptation to eliminate<br/>\n&gt; the salt, as the yeast need a small amount of salt<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; do their job properly.) Make a well in the centre of<br/>\n&gt; the flour, add the yeasty water and the rest of the<br/>\n&gt; warm water. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Using a wooden spoon, mix to a thick batter. Cover<br/>\n&gt; with plastic wrap, and stand in a warm place until<br/>\n&gt; well risen and bubbly. This will take about an hour.<br/>\n&gt; �(I find that under the covers of the waterbed, the<br/>\n&gt; temperature is absolutely perfect for rising bread<br/>\n&gt; dough). The batter doesn&#39;t rise dramatically, but it<br/>\n&gt; does expand somewhat, and the mixture takes on gases<br/>\n&gt; which are necessary in the cooking process. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Combine the bicarbonate of soda and the extra water,<br/>\n&gt; and add this mix to the dough. MIX WELL. Then leave<br/>\n&gt; this mixture to stand, covered, in a warm place for<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; further 15 minutes. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Preheat a heavy based frypan to a low heat. This<br/>\n&gt; heat<br/>\n&gt; is such that oils (I use a spray on oil like &quot;Pure<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; Simple&quot;, but butter or margarine may do) will not<br/>\n&gt; burn, smoke or misbehave. I use an electric country<br/>\n&gt; style frypan set on 5. This is almost a non-stick<br/>\n&gt; surface, and so low cholesterol oils are great. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Spray oils also allow you to coat the crumpet rings<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; you are ready to cook. Place enough mixture into the<br/>\n&gt; centre of each ring to come almost to the top of the<br/>\n&gt; ring. (The dough does rise during cooking, and this<br/>\n&gt; should be allowed for in the filling of the ring.<br/>\n&gt; Fill<br/>\n&gt; the ring enough to get good rise, but not so much<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; the ring overflows badly.) Cook for 4-8 minutes over<br/>\n&gt; this medium heat, until bubbles appear over the<br/>\n&gt; entire<br/>\n&gt; surface, and the dough appears &#39;dry&#39;. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Remove the ring, turn the crumpet over and cook for<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; further 30 - 60 seconds to brown the top. Remove<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; the pan and cool on a cake rack. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you find that the bottom is too dark (politely<br/>\n&gt; referred to as burnt), you are cooking too quickly.<br/>\n&gt; Slow it down, relax, and try again. The worst thing<br/>\n&gt; that can happen is that you have to make another<br/>\n&gt; batch. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Toast the crumpets and serve with lashings of<br/>\n&gt; butter. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enjoy everyone!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Meghan :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Send FREE video emails in Yahoo!
