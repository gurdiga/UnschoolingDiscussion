Well, you can say it, but he won&#39;t believe you.

As<br/>\n&gt; his Mama I want to step in and &quot;fix&quot; things for him, but I know that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not the best thing for any of us.  It&#39;s hard for ME to see him struggle<br/>\n&gt; with his perfectionism.  How can I be there for him and help him to work<br/>\n&gt; through his frustrations without imposing my own wishes or solutions on him?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My son is just like this. I see your son is only 4 and that can be a<br/>\ndifficult age even with the easiest-going of kids. So, first, take a lot of<br/>\ndeep breaths. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt IS really hard to parent a perfectionist child. You watch them make<br/>\nthings so much harder on themselves than they need to be. So far what I&#39;ve<br/>\nlearned is to listen sympathetically, to mirror back their feelings, to<br/>\noffer some suggestions (but NOT take it personally when they&#39;re shot down)<br/>\nand to trust that they&#39;re doing what they need to. I try to talk about<br/>\nsituations with Quinn after the intense feelings about them are over.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, how do you all handle &quot;schoolish&quot; lingo with the littler ones?<br/>\n&gt; What I mean is the &quot;age/grade level&quot; that workbooks, games and<br/>\n&gt; activities put on their products and things like that.  I&#39;m having<br/>\n&gt; difficulty explaining that it&#39;s all arbitrary, but DS is taking it<br/>\n&gt; literally and seems to be really focusing on these labels.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let him experience for himself the silliness of it all. Just get whatever<br/>\nmaterials he wants at whatever levels and get other things yourself for him<br/>\nthat you think he might enjoy; he&#39;ll get soon enough that they make no<br/>\nsense. <br/>\n<br/>\nPaula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69746,"nextTopicId":69780}}
