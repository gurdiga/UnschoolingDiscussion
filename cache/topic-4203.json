I&#39;ve suggested free drawing - just giving him a blank<br/>\n&gt; piece of paper, but then he gets upset that it doesn&#39;t look perfect.  He<br/>\n&gt; throws a tantrum on paper (scribbling until the paper rips and he gets<br/>\n&gt; crayon, pencil, pen, or marker, or whatever he&#39;s using all over the<br/>\n&gt; table).
