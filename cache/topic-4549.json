It has now been proven that cocaine is<br/>\naddictive.  Acid is horrifically dangerous.  Heroin is addictive...<br/>\n<br/>\nYes of course heroin and cocaine are addictive.  Yes one experience with<br/>\npsychedelics can result in lifelong problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Addicted individuals who are unable to deal with their addictions are<br/>\noften people who have histories of physical, mental, emotional, and/ or<br/>\nsexual abuse which contributes to their addiction problems.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is grossly untrue!  Again, many casual uses lead to addiction -<br/>\nphysical addiction (not mental).  I&#39;ve known adults who will<br/>\nadmit to being raised in as fair a fashion as their siblings, and did<br/>\nnot suffer any of the things you sight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are certainly people who use drugs casually who become addicted.<br/>\nAs for self reporting as a means of getting a clear picture of a persons<br/>\nhistory it leaves much to be desired.  I recall one individual telling<br/>\nme about her model childhood telling me that I might get to meet her<br/>\nmother who would be visiting her in hospital if they could get a matron<br/>\nas she was doing time for murder.  However there are of course people<br/>\nfrom pretty stable loving families who have problems with addictions.<br/>\n<br/>\nNevertheless.  Furthermore, it has been proven that certain chemical<br/>\nmakeups are more prone to certain addictions than others<br/>\n(not all cases, some).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe agree. some people are more prone to addiction than others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;There are strong puritanical, anti-pleasure, Calvinistic currents<br/>\nwithin<br/>\nsome of the anti-drug thinking that currently holds sway with many<br/>\npeople.  This confuses the issue and makes it difficult to educate<br/>\npeople as to the real dangers of drugs.&gt;&gt;  I still stand by this<br/>\nstatement although certainly people can and do find enormous pleasure<br/>\nand joy in living completely drug free.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, as a college student, I met many many students who began<br/>\nusing drugs recreationally, not out of psychological<br/>\nproblems.  I know of some who became addicted; some who had braindamage<br/>\nfrom sheer pleasure use (not addicted in any way).<br/>\n Some die; some quit.<br/>\n Yep I agree lots of people use drugs recreationally, those with<br/>\nproblems fare less well in terms of addiction.  Yep some people brain<br/>\ndamage themselves from drug use.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy father did not lie to me, nor do I lie to my son.  I pray to God he<br/>\nknows he can enjoy life far and safely with the joy of the Lord<br/>\nand the life He has given us, and that drugs could never offer this<br/>\npleasure, and they are dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people maintain that God created drugs for the use of his people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it very sad that you link &quot;anti-drug&quot; with &quot;anti-pleasure&quot;.<br/>\nActually, the opposite is true.  My dh was a very strong cocaine<br/>\nuser years ago.  He did not come from an &quot;abused&quot; family.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame problem as above. People have a hard time recognizing abuse when<br/>\nthey see it.  There are many &quot;normal&quot; ways of raising children which are<br/>\nhorrendously abusive.  Alice Miller writes extensively on the difficulty<br/>\nthat people have with identifying the abuse to which they are subjected.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain putting it all in the big perspective. Many, many thousands more<br/>\npeople die each year from tobacco related illness than from all of the<br/>\nother drug related illnesses, overdoses, sudden deaths, etc. combined.<br/>\n60,000 people in Canada alone compared with about 1000 deaths directly<br/>\nlinked with drug use.  The illness related deaths connected with drug<br/>\nuse is higher but can&#39;t hold a candle to the big legal killer, champion<br/>\nof premature death in the world. Tobacco.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do disagree immensely.  I can live with this.  I do consider that you<br/>\nmay be right in your view.

I thank God for the example he used me as<br/>\nin college to show friends that they could have a wonderful and better time<br/>\nwithout drugs and alcohol!<br/>\n<br/>\nI pray to the good Lord, that my son find pleasure in life and health, and<br/>\nthe joy - not in drugs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThose who chose the advice I mentioned fine.  Those who don&#39;t, fine.  I for<br/>\none am GRATEFUL for all that my father taught me about drugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, as a college student, I met many many students who began<br/>\nusing drugs recreationally, not out of psychological problems.  I know of<br/>\nsome who became addicted; some who had braindamage from sheer pleasure use<br/>\n(not addicted in any way).  Some die; some quit.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Generally people who come from intact, functional families (not a huge<br/>\nnumber) don&#39;t have major drug problems.  Of course many people who come<br/>\nfrom grossly dysfunctional families don&#39;t think that they do because<br/>\nmystification is a common phenomena in dysfunctional families.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNot true.  And again, &quot;casual&quot; &quot;recreational&quot; use has many many tragedies.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Children have been lied to about the nature of drugs, drug use,<br/>\naddiction in the same ways they have been lied to about the nature of<br/>\nlearning, education, and things as basic as &quot;feelings&quot;.  This greatly<br/>\nincreases the risks of them throwing out the rational cautions with the<br/>\nsilly hogwash.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy father did not lie to me, nor do I lie to my son.  I pray to God he<br/>\nknows he can enjoy life far and safely with the joy of the Lord and the<br/>\nlife He has given us, and that drugs could never offer this pleasure, and<br/>\nthey are dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for alcohol, I do not say folks should not drink.  However, when they<br/>\ndo, they need to be taught NOT to drink and drive.  I&#39;ve know of children<br/>\nkilled by a drunk driver, out drinking for the &quot;first time&quot;.  There&#39;s a lot<br/>\nto be said for first time users of drugs and alcohol.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would pray that parents would teach their children not to use drugs. <br/>\nFurthermore, I recall my parents telling me as a teenager: if I ever wanted<br/>\nto smoke cigarettes, I was NEVER to take one from a friend.  They would buy<br/>\nthem for me.  This was told to me right after they found out I had tried<br/>\nsmoking.  I had never smoked again.  Nevertheless, I am grateful for what<br/>\nthey taught me, and for the Lord&#39;s protection.  In this case, I&#39;ve never<br/>\nseen in personally, but have heard reliable sources (and my father being a<br/>\npolice officer and one major source, and none more honest than he, never<br/>\nexaggerated or lied about what he saw) aside from my many first hand<br/>\nexperiences as a teacher, councilor and friend, that folks lace cigarettes<br/>\nand than pass them on to friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it very sad that you link &quot;anti-drug&quot; with &quot;anti-pleasure&quot;. <br/>\nActually, the opposite is true.  My dh was a very strong cocaine user years<br/>\nago.  He did not come from an &quot;abused&quot; family.
