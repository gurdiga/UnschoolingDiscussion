Some <br/>\ntimes a bra with a crop top over the top. A tank top type t. shirt <br/>\nand then another tank top over that.  If we go out she then puts her <br/>\nUSA *yellow* (her favourite colour)jersey on. Even if the sun is <br/>\nreally hot and blue skies and every body is sweating in t.shirts.  <br/>\nShe has her undies on with boxers over that and her skirt on top of <br/>\nthose.  knee length white socks with coloured stripes around the top <br/>\n(dads) and her black sneakers.  Some times she wears her yellow polka <br/>\ndot bandana  on her head and/or her yellow scarf around her <br/>\nneck.......
