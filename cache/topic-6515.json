Let it go!<br/>\nWhat I got out of the post was that there is a lack of morals in this world.<br/>\nWe as a society,IMHO&lt;EG&gt;, have aloud too much negative to happen all in the<br/>\nname of free speech. I don&#39;t neccesarily agree with teaching bible in<br/>\nschool. That shoud be the parents job (as I have been told that it was the<br/>\nbible states anyway).I don&#39;t trust the PS system that much, if I did my<br/>\nchild would be in PS. Instead she is here with me. And no I am not HSing<br/>\nbecause of religous reasons.<br/>\nI agree that there is too much profanity, sex, and violence on tv (for<br/>\nexample) that does not need to be there. Yes I know that I can turn the tv<br/>\noff. Do you agree with the abortion issue? I think abortion should be legal,<br/>\nbut I want to know if my young daughter is thinking of having one. That is<br/>\nalot  to place on a young girl without turning to her parents for help. Oh<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you all will have something to say about that. &quot;What  about the<br/>\ngirl who can&#39;t turn to her parents.&quot;  What about my right as a parent! Is a<br/>\ngirl under the age of 18 really able to make that kind of decision on her<br/>\nown?!<br/>\nI think the bottom line is we have all let it happen! In one way or another<br/>\nand not because of prayer in school. Parents (and the community) are not<br/>\ninvolved with their childrens lives enough to know what is going on. No, not<br/>\nall but ALOT of parents. How many latch-key-kids have you known? I myself<br/>\nwas one growing up. Both parents had to work to make a living.  So who is<br/>\nthere to raise the kids? I feel I have pretty good parents, but I also feel<br/>\nthat I sorta raised myself.<br/>\nI have sooo...many thoughts flooding my head right now! I think the bottom<br/>\nline here is lack of morals!<br/>\nAnd as far as the &quot;great Idea&quot; post, maybe it shouldn&#39;t  have been posted.<br/>\nShe has already said she wouldn&#39;t have posted if she had know everyone would<br/>\nhave wigged-out! Who are you all to say what should and shouldn&#39;t be posted.<br/>\nI have had to endure many a posts that I felt didn&#39;t belong on this list,<br/>\nmostly by the ones who are *itching so much!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that is just my 2 cents!&lt;EG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6670,"nextTopicId":6654}}
