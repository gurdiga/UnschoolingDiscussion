I didn&#39;t use FLO for the assessments. My cousin was a certified<br/>\nstate teacher so I had her do it. Back then, Cristina was 8-9 and had this<br/>\npanic over tests. I have no idea why since she&#39;d never had one. So we&#39;d go<br/>\nto my cousin&#39;s house and she&#39;d talk with her about what she knows and she<br/>\nalso had her fill out some quizzes. Then my cousin would write a note (for<br/>\nmy records) saying that Cristina was on par with her grade level.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen this cousin let her certification slide and I discovered FLO. I was<br/>\nquietly worried that Cristina would flip over having to take a test, but<br/>\nwhen it came down to it there was no problem. I think she was just scaring<br/>\nherself from what she had heard from ps kids and what she saw on TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nValerie in Tacoma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Nina Sutcliffe","from":"Nina Sutcliffe &lt;ninacs@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"8b7_kDmpZunF_GxKSKBxfTMtYSrZ9PJa1WsBowuFI5Gk096jCh5yAP1ovHZAk0E8oGf4vN2auJz9cBa-KNgn1-hraqK4nRYPYOZsvw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1035","postDate":"984460638","msgId":16940,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI2RDJFRDVFLjE4MCVuaW5hY3NAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDk4NDIxNzQ0OC4zMTAuNjQ4ODgubDEwQHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":16907,"nextInTopic":16942,"prevInTime":16939,"nextInTime":16941,"topicId":16895,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Valerie - i m behind in checkin emails... and am checking them in reverse!

Did you do that or the test?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nina<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **Oh Nina, you were born to be a mom if you excell in worrying. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We did the Metropolitan test thru FLO. I chose that one because it was the<br/>\n&gt; shortest. Just $22 I think. It&#39;s like a shorter version of the CAT. They<br/>\n&gt; sent it to me. I &quot;administered&quot; it to my 10 year old daughter. We mailed it<br/>\n&gt; back. They sent the results. It was much simpler than I expected. This was<br/>\n&gt; my daughter&#39;s first test. We&#39;ve never even done worksheets, so I wondered<br/>\n&gt; how she&#39;d do. Now I know these tests are bogus, but (since we opted to play<br/>\n&gt; the game) it was great that she did so well. She tested at a 5th grade level<br/>\n&gt; and scored anywhere from grade 4.5 to 11.0. That really reassured the<br/>\n&gt; grandparents---ha. So it wasn&#39;t any big deal. We&#39;re the only ones with the<br/>\n&gt; test scores. FLO doesn&#39;t turn it into anyone else. And I&#39;m sure no one will<br/>\n&gt; ever ask to see them, either. I know a mom up in Edmonds with 8 kids...has a<br/>\n&gt; box stuffed full of annual tests...and is disappointed that no one ever<br/>\n&gt; wants to see them. (she&#39;s kidding about being disappointed of course) We did<br/>\n&gt; evaluations for the 2 years prior to testing. That&#39;s great, too, depending<br/>\n&gt; on who&#39;s doing it. I think we&#39;ll stick with testing just because it was<br/>\n&gt; simpler and shorter.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Valerie in Tacoma </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"mary krzyzanowski","from":"&quot;mary krzyzanowski&quot; &lt;meembeam@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"0WRVZBhFSzweA96GtlKv3i7K-mVXn50Phjk_ov6iAL8gAnRPSxd5DItrT79O3eiZVrEY-_xzbWV_hkDZmMrGv67AROXO3Mgc1Q21xV6O8G6x","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1035","postDate":"984283510","msgId":16907,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY2MkZkVnZzTzNIdjEzS01nWUcwMDAwNzQ3MEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":16895,"nextInTopic":16940,"prevInTime":16906,"nextInTime":16908,"topicId":16895,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Janet, My dd (8 and 10) have enjoyed the American Girls series.
