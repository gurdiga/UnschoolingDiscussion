One day I was reading <br/>\nhere about someone with three kids, infant, toddler and five year old, and I <br/>\nthought, &quot;WOW!  How hard that must be!&quot; and then I remembered, &quot;HEY, I did <br/>\nthat!&quot;   The memory fades.  &lt;g&gt;  Mine are 10, 13 and 16 now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have found that learning often goes faster and easier when there are <br/>\nmore kids around interacting than when it&#39;s just my three.   For one thing, <br/>\nthe same old toys and games are played in a new light with other kids.  Some <br/>\ngames need more than two or three kids.  Some yard activites (basketball, <br/>\nplaying on the swings) are more fun with more kids.  Other kids have other <br/>\nanswers to questions, have other experiences and ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44525,"nextTopicId":44530}}
