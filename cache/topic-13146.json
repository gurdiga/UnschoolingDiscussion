When I first came to have any strong <br/>\nbeliefs about politics (after a few somewhat apathetic years as a struggling <br/>\nyoung single mother), I felt much more alligned with Democratic thought on <br/>\nmost issues.  However, as time went by, I found that there were a couple of <br/>\nbig issues that I didn&#39;t agree with them on, homeschooling being a major one. <br/>\n I feel that unschooling is a reflection of my liberalism because I want my <br/>\nkids to learn freely and not be brutalized by a regimented, often harsh style <br/>\nof &quot;educating.&quot;  <br/>\n     One thing I hate about the way the two party system has become is that <br/>\nthere doesn&#39;t seem to be a point by point consideration of each issue by <br/>\naverage citizens or at least their views can&#39;t be accurately reflected <br/>\nbecause we have to choose between two sweeping platforms.  I have a friend <br/>\nwho is deeply bothered by legal abortion and so tends to vote for Republicans <br/>\nyet she strongly believes in a higher minimum wage, unions, worker safety <br/>\nlaws, and other Democrat takes on things.  Whether someone agrees with her <br/>\nfeelings on abortion or not, my point is that these issues should be <br/>\nconsidered one by one.<br/>\n     I resent having to choose in this way.  Just because a person believes <br/>\nin children being able to learn at home (or whatever other issue), does not <br/>\nmean she believes in no or low minimum wage laws, getting rid of safety <br/>\nregulations for the meat or other industries, or not having basic health care <br/>\nfor all people, for example.<br/>\n     I am generally a supporter of unions because in certain situations, they <br/>\nseem to be the only way a person can get a living wage and some job <br/>\nprotection.  But the NEA angers me because I think they are dishonest in <br/>\ntheir attack on homeschooling.  Their primary motive seems to be job security <br/>\nand not what is good for the homeschooled kids.  I would feel much better <br/>\nabout them if they would stick to issues directly concerning their own pay <br/>\nand working situation.<br/>\n     I think these are some reasons that people end up not voting.  They get <br/>\ndisgusted with the process and feel that neither of the big two (and maybe <br/>\nnone of the smaller parties, either) really represent their views on the <br/>\nissues important to them.

He also believes the federal government should not <br/>\nimpair a parent&#39;s decision to school their children at home. However, Gore <br/>\nfeels that the federal role in education should focus on ensuring that every <br/>\nchild in America&#39;s public schools is educated at the highest level.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe DNC statement, and that of Gore&#39;s spokesman come at a time when home <br/>\nschoolers around the country are being faced with an increasing number of <br/>\ntruancy accusations, and parents find themselves becoming legal experts on <br/>\ntheir right to educate children at home without government interference. <br/>\n<br/>\nVega stressed Gore&#39;s commitment to the government&#39;s school system. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Managing a strong, successful public school system reflects upon our <br/>\ncommitment to all children,&quot; Vega said. &quot;It is also a key factor in the <br/>\ncontinued economic success of our nation. That&#39;s why Al Gore believes that we <br/>\nhave a responsibility to our future to continue improving America&#39;s public <br/>\nschools.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nVega also noted that the vice president&#39;s position on home schooling &quot;stays <br/>\nthe same&quot; in the face of ideological opposition on the part, not only of the <br/>\nDemocratic National Committee, but especially the powerful National Education <br/>\nAssociation. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI quoted this from:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.worldnetdaily.com/bluesky_fosterj_news/20000912_xnfoj_candidates.sh\">http://www.worldnetdaily.com/bluesky_fosterj_news/20000912_xnfoj_candidates.sh</a><br/>\ntml<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a less than perfect world, I am OK with Mr. Gore remaining focussed on the <br/>\n&quot;federal&quot; role being to improve public school and not to &quot;impair&quot; <br/>\nhomeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13181,"nextTopicId":13185}}
