Some examples were lunch room supervision, doing up jackets for physically incapacitated children so they could go out to recess, handling book club orders, etc.  Some were reasonable, others not so much.  Anyway, they struck for quite a while, until they got significant pay raises. This prompted a rash of jokes like, &quot;How many teachers does it take to change a lightbulb?  Well, *that&#39;s* not in their job description!!&quot;.
