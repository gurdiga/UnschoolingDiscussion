We are SO lucky to have<br/>\ndiscovered this lifestyle and to have settled into it comfortably without<br/>\nall the worries that many homeschoolers have.  (are they keeping up with<br/>\ntheir peers?)  It just feels so right and good.  I used to shout it from the<br/>\nroof tops, but no one understood what I was shouting about.  ;0)  We just<br/>\nhappily go along every day and it feels so right and good.  The parenting<br/>\nchanges that I&#39;ve made after reading on these lists have made our<br/>\nunschooling lives twice as sweet too.  I am so thankful to all the people<br/>\nwho participate here and on other unschooling lists.

These <br/>\nchildren are so happy and so endlessly curious.  My 13yo dd--who <br/>\njust left school this year and claims she doesn&#39;t like to read--<br/>\nspending an hour poring over an article in the Smithsonian about Ken <br/>\nKesey.  &quot;Oh, Mom, this is so cool!  Have you ever heard of &quot;One Flew <br/>\nOver the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest?&quot;  The livingroom floor covered in Star Wars <br/>\nLegos after my 10yo ds watched the new DVD release with extras.  Now <br/>\nhe&#39;s doing something with string and a Batman action figure and the <br/>\nspiral staircase to the basement.  Teaching Corrina new guitar <br/>\nchords.  Talking about the History of Rock and Roll video we watched <br/>\nlast week.  Beethoven booming on the stereo.  Listening to an <br/>\naudiobook of &quot;Animal Farm&quot; on the way to choir and talking about <br/>\ncommunism.  Homestar Runner!  Baking cookies.  &quot;Why is it half white <br/>\nsugar and half brown sugar?  I&#39;m going to try it with all <br/>\nbrown.&quot;  &quot;OK.&quot;  &quot;Mom, how to you spell &#39;undaunted?&#39;&quot;  Going to the <br/>\ngym together and spending an hour without talking--everyone <br/>\nfollowing his/her own program.  Resting together.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just the sweetest way to live.  It is moment after moment of <br/>\npure grace.  When I tell people I &quot;homeschool,&quot;  they give me kind <br/>\nof a sad, sympathetic look and say how difficult that must be.
