(in fact- not nursing him could lead to other problems,<br/>\nlike nursing strikes and like you mentioned, engorgement)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo really help you, I need more information- but here goes<br/>\n<br/>\n*pull him in towards you as he is biting, he will let go<br/>\n<br/>\n*a baby can not bite while he is nursing, his tongue covers his teeth while<br/>\nhe nurses.  put your hand right by his jaw, and be ready to feel when he<br/>\npulls his tonge back- when he does, put your finger between his jaws and<br/>\nstop the bite.<br/>\n<br/>\n*if he acts like he wants to nurse *nurse him*, if he goes to bite, do the<br/>\nabove- then offer your breast again.  Listen to if he really doesnt want to<br/>\nnurse or if maybe he would rather have the other side . Babies are extremely<br/>\naware of milk flow and supply- and know which breast they want and when they<br/>\nwant it if allowed to decide for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n* babies bite for lots of reasons: teething, maybe he has a pacifier or<br/>\nsippy cup that he has enjoyed biting and tried it on you, frustration (maybe<br/>\nhe didnt really want to nurse, maybe your milk wasnt coming fast enough,<br/>\netc)- also it depends on the age of the baby- your little guy is a tiny one!<br/>\nDon&#39;t think of this as &quot;discipline&quot; or &quot;punishment&quot;- he is trying to<br/>\ncommunicate something to you- hanging back and listening to him will go a<br/>\nlong way to developing trust and solving this problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck Sweety!<br/>\nHappy nursing<br/>\nBronwen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10645038,"authorName":"sal3school","from":"&quot;sal3school&quot; &lt;sal3school@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Breastfeeding","postDate":"1033706426","msgId":45272,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTkwMWMyNmI2MCQyOWM5ODNlMCRiZjYyNWQzZkBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwZi4xODQyYjQ1ZC4yYWNlNTcyY0Bjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":45261,"nextInTopic":45276,"prevInTime":45271,"nextInTime":45273,"topicId":7876,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 5 month old has just started chewing on me tonight!

I think with my first daughter the decision was made because of a lack","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1260391887\">Hi there, I happen to be one of those terrible moms who didn&#39;t breast feed <br/>\nmy children.  I think with my first daughter the decision was made because of <br/>\na lack of information on my part.  When my son was born 2 years later I did <br/>\ntry to breast feed him.  It was quite pleasurable, as long as I was nursing <br/>\non the left side.  The right side was another story.  I can&#39;t describe the <br/>\nstrange sort of pain I felt.  It wasn&#39;t anything like the normal pain I was <br/>\nfeeling on the left side, and it didn&#39;t go away.  For some reason my right <br/>\nbreast (especially the nipple)  is very, very sensitive (all the time).  I <br/>\ntalked to my doctor who dismissed me saying &quot; no one&#39;s body is perfectly <br/>\nsymmetrical.  We&#39;re not exactly the same on both sides - not in shape, size <br/>\nor sensation&quot;.  So, I stopped breastfeeding my son.  I didn&#39;t even try with <br/>\nmy next daughter.  I was very discouraged at that point.  When my fourth baby <br/>\nwas born, 14 months ago, I did try to nurse her.  She was injured at birth <br/>\n(by the same doctor who gave me the advice on symmetry) and because of low <br/>\nmuscle tone she had problems latching on and sucking.  I was totally stressed <br/>\nout!  There was just too much going on.  It was our first year of <br/>\nhomeschooling, my baby was hurt, and I knew that to successfully breastfeed <br/>\nher was going to take lots of time and energy (especially since I&#39;d basically <br/>\nbe doing it for the first time).  Besides all that I never did figure out <br/>\nwhat the problem with my right breast was...or is.  So, I quit.  I spent the <br/>\nfirst few months of her life avoiding some of the very people who <br/>\ncould/should have been supporting me.   You know why?  Because I didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto hear the breastfeeding lecture...again.  I know it&#39;s best for the baby!  I <br/>\nknow! I know! I know!  And guess what?  I think homeschooling is best for <br/>\nkids.  But I don&#39;t go around preaching about it to every person I meet.  In <br/>\nfact, I don&#39;t even talk about it unless someone asks me to.  I figure that <br/>\neveryone has their reasons for doing things the way they do.  Most people are <br/>\ndoing all they know  they&#39;re capable of doing for their families with the <br/>\ncircumstances they&#39;ve been given.  Notice I didn&#39;t say ARE capable of doing.  <br/>\nWe&#39;ve all had times when we were capable of doing more than we&#39;ve actually <br/>\ndone.  Maybe I just got lucky, but all of my kids have been very healthy.  No <br/>\near infections, no allergies, and only the occasional cold.  They&#39;re right on <br/>\ntarget for weight, and have met all of their developmental milestones at the <br/>\n&quot;appropriate&quot; time ( except for my youngest, but that has nothing to do with <br/>\nwhat I&#39;m feeding her)  Oh yeah!  They&#39;re really smart too. BG.  And when the <br/>\nyoung daughter of an acquaintance said to me as I was bottle feeding my baby <br/>\none day last sumer  &quot; Ugh!  why are you feeding her that yucky stuff&quot;?  I <br/>\nexplained the best way I could. Then I said a silent prayer of thanksgiving <br/>\nthat she was alive and that I was able to feed her at all.  The birth of my 1 <br/>\nyear old was a major life altering event for me.  I no longer worry about the <br/>\ntrivial things in life (well, not as much as I used to anyway).  Who cares <br/>\nwhat the house looks like?  Or, the clothes, or my hair, or the car?  I&#39;m too <br/>\nbusy loving the children I&#39;ve been blessed with to worry about what other <br/>\npeople think.  And I for one, have certainly got better things to do than to <br/>\nmonitor the parenting choices of others.  Okay, all that being said...I do <br/>\nwant to say that if there is a baby number 5 in my future I will most <br/>\ndefinitely try again to breastfeed.  When that time arrives, I believe I&#39;ll <br/>\nneed lots of advice.  And I think I know just where I can find it.  Baby <br/>\nneeds me...gotta go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJodye</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74988,"nextTopicId":74989}}
