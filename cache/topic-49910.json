I never learned I was<br/>\nadopted, it&#39;s part of my history.  The adoption stories are part of the<br/>\nlitany of family stories I grew up with.  (There was a point when I was mad<br/>\nat my older sister because she remembered MY adoption and I of course<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t remember hers!)  We celebrated 3 birthdays a year -- birth,<br/>\nadoption, and baptism, and each one had seperate traditions.  We always went<br/>\nout to eat at a fancy place on my adoption birthday, which was pretty<br/>\nspecial; those were lean years for my parents.  I don&#39;t look like my<br/>\nparents, but I was a teenager before that ever really occurred to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen children whose biological parents had less tie with them than my<br/>\nadoptive parents.  Adopted children at least know that they were wanted.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a real effort to adopt.  Lotsa people can have babies &quot;the easy way&quot;!<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would hope that an adoptive parent would reassure an adopted child that he<br/>\nor she was their descendant, too.  It&#39;s not just about blood.  It&#39;s about<br/>\nyour heritage.  <br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49862,"nextTopicId":49893}}
