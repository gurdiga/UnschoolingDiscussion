No extra work, research or<br/>\nplanning on my part. And they make it look and sound so wonderful in the<br/>\ncatalog.

They want to get started right away. I can&#39;t get the<br/>\nbooks out fast enough. They both want my help in instructing them what to<br/>\ndo - I have to divide my time - they start getting frustrated. Days go by<br/>\nand they don&#39;t want to do their schoolwork anymore! They just want to play.<br/>\nWe&#39;re maybe half way through the first one. Then I come up with a schedule<br/>\nand consequences for not completing schoolwork. UGGHH!! I will NEVER forget<br/>\nthis. Just like you said, it was terrible, boring and unnatural. And<br/>\nthousands, millions (?) of hs&#39;ing families do this every day??

Just like you said, it was terrible, boring and unnatural.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though I&#39;m new to this list (well, I was on it several years back but <br/>\nwas not ready for it) I still can relate to this feeling. I always know when <br/>\nI&#39;m trying to &quot;teach&quot; something and so do my kids and even though they like <br/>\nto tell me that they aren&#39;t  learning anything they also rebel whenever I&#39;m <br/>\ntrying to *teach*  them anything, LOL What a rock and a hard place.<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35677,"nextTopicId":35709}}
