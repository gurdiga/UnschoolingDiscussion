When my kids ask what I think or believe, I tell them, but I don&#39;t ask them to believe as I do. We are, for want of a better term, atheists who grew up in churches.  Myself in Southern Baptist, my husband in Methodist.  We teach our children what Christians believe, what Hindus believe, and what ancient cultures believed.  We don&#39;t tell them what to think or feel, just expose them to all thoughts and let them take what feels right for them.  And we tell them that&#39;s what we want.  That religion/spirituality/faith is personal and just like choosing what clothes to wear or what foods to eat, it&#39;s okay for everyone to be different and no one is wrong as long as it&#39;s what is truly in their heart.           <br/>\n    <br/>\nWe never condemn other&#39;s or keep them from &quot;religious&quot; things.  They participate in blessing food at friends homes, they understand Christian holidays (as well as others), they are going bowling with their babysitter and her church youth group on Saturday.  The only thing we do ask of them is to live by the Golden Rule, which is universal to all religions.<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15123,"nextTopicId":49410}}
