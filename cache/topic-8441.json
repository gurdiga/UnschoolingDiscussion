I  have<br/>\n&gt; received 7 warnings so far today about the &#39;Love&#39; Virus.  In addition, a<br/>\n&gt; friend just informed me that his entire computer has just been wiped<br/>\n&gt; out.  The first lines alone are enough to suggest extreme caution.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The source of this article<br/>\n&gt; is:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/news/403350.asp?0a=2107110-\">http://www.msnbc.com/news/403350.asp?0a=2107110-</a><br/>\n&gt; The site contains additional information on this virus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; THE STATISTICS ARE STAGGERING. Nearly 30<br/>\n&gt; percent of businesses in Great Britain, and nearly 80<br/>\n&gt; percent in Sweden, have been infected by the virus,<br/>\n&gt; according to anti-virus research firm Network Associates.<br/>\n&gt; In fact, the company says, ATM cash machines in Belgium<br/>\n&gt; were knocked offline thanks to the deluge of e-mail traffic<br/>\n&gt; created by the virus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Many companies â and even the Army and the Navy<br/>\n&gt; â have resorted to simply shutting down their e-mail<br/>\n&gt; system while the virus worms its way around the Internet.<br/>\n&gt; âThis is the worst Iâve ever seen in my nine years in the<br/>\n&gt; business,â* said Mikko Hypponen, manager of anti-virus<br/>\n&gt; research at F-Secure Corp. âWe actually donât know why<br/>\n&gt;   itâs so widespread, why itâs spreading so fast.â*<br/>\n&gt; For example, one European magazine has lost its<br/>\n&gt; photograph archive, and the U.K.âs House of Commons<br/>\n&gt; closed down its e-mail systems temporarily over concerns<br/>\n&gt; about the virus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The virus targets users of Microsoft Outlook and only<br/>\n&gt;   works under the Windows operating system. (Microsoft is a<br/>\n&gt; partner in MSNBC.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Internet users are advised to update their virus scanning<br/>\n&gt; software as soon as possible. But throughout the day,<br/>\n&gt; anti-virus Web pages have been swamped with traffic and<br/>\n&gt; largely unreadable. So for now, the best bet is to avoid<br/>\n&gt; opening attachments entirely.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Researchers say the technology that spreads the virus is<br/>\n&gt; no smarter than that of previous viruses, leaving them a bit<br/>\n&gt; baffled over LoveLetterâs worldwide rapage. One possible<br/>\n&gt; reason â victims canât resist opening an attachment that<br/>\n&gt; claims to be a love letter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; âOnly human nature to want to open a letter that leads<br/>\n&gt; off with âI love you,ââ* said David Perry, public education<br/>\n&gt; director at anti-virus research firm Trend Micro. He also<br/>\n&gt; suspects that because itâs been several months since the last<br/>\n&gt; virus scare, computer users are a bit more gullible than they<br/>\n&gt; were perhaps a year ago, in the wake of the Melissa virus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The file attachment is called âLOVE LETTER FOR<br/>\n&gt; YOU.TXT.vbs,â* which might also be adding to the<br/>\n&gt; confusion for consumers. It offers the appearance of being a<br/>\n&gt;   harmless text file, and the âvbsâ* extension, which stands for<br/>\n&gt; Visual Basic Script, may also mislead users who are now<br/>\n&gt; trained to be skeptical of executable files with the extension<br/>\n&gt; .exe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; WHO IS BEHIND THE VIRUS?<br/>\n&gt; In the virusâs source code, an individual named<br/>\n&gt; âspyderâ* takes credit for authoring the program. Hypponen<br/>\n&gt; said the name is unknown on the virus scene.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a bit of programming understatement, the code<br/>\n&gt; contains a comment, likely by the author, suggesting the<br/>\n&gt; virus is âsimple but i think this is good.â*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The code also references Manila, Philippines, but that<br/>\n&gt; doesnât necessarily indicate the author lives there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are no other hints as to who âspyderâ* might be<br/>\n&gt; other than this cryptic message within the code: âbarok<br/>\n&gt; -loveletter(vbe) âi hate go to schoolâ*.â*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Many European computer systems shut down e-mail<br/>\n&gt; servers Thursday. Britainâs House of Commons was the<br/>\n&gt; latest U.K. organization to succumb to the virus. The lower<br/>\n&gt; House of Commons shut down its e-mail system for about<br/>\n&gt; two hours to safeguard against the virus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Britainâs Consumers Association and a major anti-virus<br/>\n&gt; firm said they also had been bombarded by calls from<br/>\n&gt; businesses whose e-mail servers had been hit by a blizzard<br/>\n&gt; of messages.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; British Internet service provider Freeserve said it had<br/>\n&gt; set up a filter to screen out any e-mails with the words âI<br/>\n&gt; love you.â*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; You have a voice mail message waiting for you at iHello.com:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3555/1/_/31067/_/957563365/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3555/1/_/31067/_/957563365/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8440,"nextTopicId":8398}}
