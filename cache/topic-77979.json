This is not true. It is very close to 100% false. Learners make learning. &quot;<br/>\n-- Former teacher, John Holt<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; What we want to see is the child in pursuit of knowledge, not knowledge in pursuit of the child. &quot;<br/>\n-- George Bernard Shaw <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; Homeschooling and public schooling are as opposite as two sides of a coin. In a homeschooling environment, the teacher need not be certified, but the child MUST learn.
