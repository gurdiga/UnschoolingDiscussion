Thus:<br/>\nRetribution:  I&#39;m going to kill you because you killed my brother.<br/>\nAnticipation:  I&#39;m going to kill you because I killed your brother.<br/>\nDiplomacy:  I&#39;m going to kill my brother and then kill you on the pretext<br/>\nthat your brother did it.&quot;--Douglas Adams<br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want your children to fine tune their critical capabilities, learn to<br/>\nbetter see through the veneer of society, and eventually become veritable<br/>\nfountains of unconventional ideas, I strongly recommend you introduce them<br/>\nto the &quot;Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy,&quot; and other works of Douglas Adams.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam&#39;s thinking had a major impact on mine during an impressionable stage in<br/>\nmy life.
