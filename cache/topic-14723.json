I am hoping to <br/>\n&gt; get some of your feedback.  My son was seven in<br/>\n&gt; October, and wants to learn <br/>\n&gt; how to read but is very frustrated by the whole<br/>\n&gt; process. We have Oak Meadow, <br/>\n&gt; Sing, Spell, Read, Write and How to teach your child<br/>\n&gt; to read in 100 lessons. <br/>\n&gt; I completely buy the whole unschooling philosophy,<br/>\n&gt; and I have educational <br/>\n&gt; materials available to my boys but don&#39;t push them<br/>\n&gt; into it. We used Oak <br/>\n&gt; Meadow last year for probably a month, and SSRW for<br/>\n&gt; about the same amount of <br/>\n&gt; time.  At the beginning of the year, my seven year<br/>\n&gt; old and five year old both <br/>\n&gt; said that they wanted to learn how to read. We<br/>\n&gt; started using the 100 lessons <br/>\n&gt; book, and they both seemed to enjoy it. My five year<br/>\n&gt; old asked to do the <br/>\n&gt; lesson every day. We got to chapter 30, and both<br/>\n&gt; lost interest so we stopped. <br/>\n&gt; I noticed a big difference in their learning styles.<br/>\n&gt; My five year old seemed <br/>\n&gt; to grasp phonics better than my seven year old. My<br/>\n&gt; seven year old would add <br/>\n&gt; sounds, flip-flop sounds or just guess the word. He<br/>\n&gt; would actually sound out <br/>\n&gt; a word, practically saying it. Then I would ask him<br/>\n&gt; what the word was, and he <br/>\n&gt; had no clue. He would sound out cat perfect, and<br/>\n&gt; then say the word was frog. <br/>\n&gt; Their learning differences led me to look into<br/>\n&gt; different learning styles, <br/>\n&gt; which led me to several books on right-brained vs.<br/>\n&gt; left-brained kids. My <br/>\n&gt; seven year old definitely seems to fit the<br/>\n&gt; descriptions for a right-brained <br/>\n&gt; child. Several of the books indicated that<br/>\n&gt; right-brained children seem to <br/>\n&gt; learn reading better with the whole-language or<br/>\n&gt; sight-word method. I feel <br/>\n&gt; stuck because my seven year old really wants to<br/>\n&gt; learn how to read, but he <br/>\n&gt; gets so completely frustrated. When this happens, we<br/>\n&gt; just stop. On one hand I <br/>\n&gt; feel this is best, but on the other hand, I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want him to get <br/>\n&gt; discouraged. I think it&#39;s also difficult for him<br/>\n&gt; because his five year old <br/>\n&gt; brother seems so comfortable and at ease trying to<br/>\n&gt; read. Recently, my seven <br/>\n&gt; year old said to me, &quot;I would know how to read if<br/>\n&gt; you taught me&quot;. I was <br/>\n&gt; floored. First of all, I felt like a failure, and<br/>\n&gt; then I felt really sad for <br/>\n&gt; him. I&#39;m not sure what to do next. I would just love<br/>\n&gt; some feedback from some <br/>\n&gt; of you with older kids. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks.<br/>\n&gt; Wendy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!

I labeled <br/>\neverything in the house for my 4yo dd, and I try to read to them as often as <br/>\npossible.  I turn the closed-captioning on the TV.  But 4yo dd just wasn&#39;t <br/>\npicking up anything.  Not that I was concerned or anything, I was just <br/>\nnoticing that she didn&#39;t seem at all interested.  I&#39;ve always thought that <br/>\nthe phonics way of learning was really stupid, how could anyone possibly <br/>\nremember all of those rules?  Also, I understand how your son can sound out <br/>\na word and still not know what the word is.  I STILL do that.  So I&#39;ve <br/>\nalways related to the whole word method of learning to read.  It seems to <br/>\nmake so much more sense to me.  But my 4yo dd, has shown signs of picking up <br/>\nreading in a phonicsy way.  She&#39;s started writing, and asking me how to <br/>\nspell things, now she is learning what sound every letter makes and putting <br/>\nthe sounds together to form words.  She is doing all of this on her own, I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t even brooched the subject of phonics.  But I think this is how she <br/>\nwill learn to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo- my 2yo dd has started picking up whole words.  I was completely <br/>\nsurprised by this because I wasn&#39;t even focusing on her, I was trying to <br/>\nhelp the 4yo along.  But suddenly 2yo has started recognizing words like <br/>\ntable, chair, and such from the labels all over the house.  2yo dd can <br/>\nrecognizes the words and 4yo doesn&#39;t.  I have everything labeled, and then I <br/>\nwrite words on post-it notes, for instance, I have a &quot;coffee table&quot; label, <br/>\nthen I write &quot;table&quot; on the note and say &quot;okay Jordan (4yo dd) this says <br/>\ncoffee table so do you know what this says&quot; and she looks at both of them <br/>\nand just can&#39;t figure it out.  She says &quot;chair&quot;, but then along comes 2yo dd <br/>\nand she says &quot;oh that&#39;s table&quot; and takes the post-it note to the table and <br/>\nmatches it up with the label on the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there are videos with sing-along songs on them, that might help your <br/>\nson pick up the words.  Because as the song sings, the words are shown on <br/>\nthe screen with a little bouncy ball that bounces on the word as it is sung.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Samantha Stopple &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sammimag@...\">sammimag@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Right-brained children<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 22 Dec 2000 21:59:21 -0800 (PST)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;seven year old definitely seems to fit the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; descriptions for a right-brained<br/>\n&gt; &gt; child.

My experience is that there is a long period of storing up <br/>\nknowledge of the words before the actual reading &quot;kicks in.&quot; Once that <br/>\nhappens they progress pretty quickly. While they were in these pre and early <br/>\nreading stages we worked with the &quot;I Can Read&quot; series of books many of which <br/>\nare by Dr. Seuss and his alter ego, Theo LeSieg, as well as Sid Hoff and <br/>\nothers. These are fun books.<br/>\n     My son&#39;s reading took off around age 8. My younger daughter, Ariana, <br/>\ntook somewhat longer and was much more frustrated as she&#39;s more into books. <br/>\nWe would work with her but she would just reach her limit with trying to get <br/>\nit. I would have to keep reassuring her that eventually her reading would <br/>\nkick in. And it eventually did. During the summer of &#39;99 when she was 9 1/2 <br/>\nshe was in an &quot;American Girls&quot; craft class and I had to read the little books <br/>\nto her. By winter of 2000 at 10 1/4 she was taking another such class and was <br/>\nable to read the books to herself. Then this past summer she took off. The <br/>\nlibrary had a Harry Potter theme for the reading program and had a great <br/>\nbookcase of &quot;magic books&quot; to choose from. Some were old favorites and some <br/>\nwe&#39;d never seen. She read and read and read all summer and hasn&#39;t slowed down <br/>\nsince. This fall (at age 11) in addition to her recreational reading she&#39;s <br/>\nstarted reading historical novels. She just finished &quot;Johnny Tremain.&quot; She <br/>\nwaited so long to read that she&#39;s still ecstatic about being able to.<br/>\n    Both Michael and Ariana were whole word learners. Phonics worked for <br/>\nMichael to fill in his learning after he already knew how to read. It still <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make any sense to Ariana.  <br/>\n    Part of why I have found it easy to be relaxed about their learning <br/>\nprocess with reading is that I taught myself to read when I was 4yo, <br/>\nlistening to records from the <br/>\nlibrary (downtown Enoch Pratt in Baltimore) and reading along. My oldest also <br/>\nlearned to read at 4 by playing phonics games with my husband. Looking back <br/>\non it, he wishes that he&#39;d left her a bit more to her own devices, partly <br/>\nbecause by age 10 or 11 she needed glasses and the other two don&#39;t. <br/>\nNonetheless, reading came easier and earlier to her than to the others. All <br/>\nmy kids are good readers at this point, I trust yours will be too in good <br/>\ntime. <br/>\n<br/>\n                         Amalia Darling, mother to Jenny 20, Michael 15 and <br/>\nAriana 11</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Samantha Stopple","from":"Samantha Stopple &lt;sammimag@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"JLAXcBA6oLup7HLv8m7xRNtOY2Fnrefwh7GSuv5h25MKtnW2uyG42rLLNeMUMxfEBIlkZ5CwBct4yuHlTTLxZcBuw99UMcJB-KE1WA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Right-brained children","postDate":"977551161","msgId":14727,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAxMjIzMDU1OTIxLjM2MjcucW1haWxAd2ViMzMwNi5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":14723,"nextInTopic":14728,"prevInTime":14726,"nextInTime":14728,"topicId":14723,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"seven year old definitely seems to fit the ...

I am hoping to <br/>\nget some of your feedback.  My son was seven in October, and wants to learn <br/>\nhow to read but is very frustrated by the whole process. We have Oak Meadow, <br/>\nSing, Spell, Read, Write and How to teach your child to read in 100 lessons. <br/>\nI completely buy the whole unschooling philosophy, and I have educational <br/>\nmaterials available to my boys but don&#39;t push them into it. We used Oak <br/>\nMeadow last year for probably a month, and SSRW for about the same amount of <br/>\ntime.  At the beginning of the year, my seven year old and five year old both <br/>\nsaid that they wanted to learn how to read. We started using the 100 lessons <br/>\nbook, and they both seemed to enjoy it. My five year old asked to do the <br/>\nlesson every day. We got to chapter 30, and both lost interest so we stopped. <br/>\nI noticed a big difference in their learning styles. My five year old seemed <br/>\nto grasp phonics better than my seven year old. My seven year old would add <br/>\nsounds, flip-flop sounds or just guess the word. He would actually sound out <br/>\na word, practically saying it. Then I would ask him what the word was, and he <br/>\nhad no clue. He would sound out cat perfect, and then say the word was frog. <br/>\nTheir learning differences led me to look into different learning styles, <br/>\nwhich led me to several books on right-brained vs. left-brained kids. My <br/>\nseven year old definitely seems to fit the descriptions for a right-brained <br/>\nchild. Several of the books indicated that right-brained children seem to <br/>\nlearn reading better with the whole-language or sight-word method. I feel <br/>\nstuck because my seven year old really wants to learn how to read, but he <br/>\ngets so completely frustrated. When this happens, we just stop. On one hand I <br/>\nfeel this is best, but on the other hand, I don&#39;t want him to get <br/>\ndiscouraged. I think it&#39;s also difficult for him because his five year old <br/>\nbrother seems so comfortable and at ease trying to read. Recently, my seven <br/>\nyear old said to me, &quot;I would know how to read if you taught me&quot;. I was <br/>\nfloored. First of all, I felt like a failure, and then I felt really sad for <br/>\nhim. I&#39;m not sure what to do next. I would just love some feedback from some <br/>\nof you with older kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\nWendy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14687,"nextTopicId":14713}}
