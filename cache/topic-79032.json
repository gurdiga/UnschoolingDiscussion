It&#39;s family friendly. :-) We<br/>\nwon&#39;t have the private room (he said that it&#39;s been booked for a long time)<br/>\nbut they&#39;ll do their best seating us together. Dinner&#39;s at 6pm. I don&#39;t have<br/>\nany idea how long it would take to walk 2 blocks. Depends on how big their<br/>\nblocks are. I wouldn&#39;t think more than 1/2 hour. We could leave from the<br/>\nlobby of the hotel at 5:30. We plan to walk unless it&#39;s a scorcher. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n    I couldn&#39;t get more than a recording for Hunter Gatherer so it may not<br/>\nbe kid friendly. With it being a Micro brewery it may not be. I plan to at<br/>\nleast stop in there to see if I&#39;m not too tired.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Here&#39;s the restaurants again. Stay safe and I&#39;ll see some of you<br/>\nthursday evening. <br/>\n<br/>\nBarb E<br/>\n&quot;Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but<br/>\nsometimes your smile can be the source of your joy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n- Thich Nhat Hanh, Author and Buddhist Monk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to go ahead and suggest California Dreaming which is two blocks<br/>\n---and an easy walk---from the hotel (and easy drive, too). It&#39;s LARGE, so<br/>\nit <br/>\nwould accomodate several families together easily. Many different menu<br/>\nitems. (I <br/>\nusually get the Chicken Caesar Salad---it&#39;s HUGE.) Prices are<br/>\nreasonable,---but call to make sure. Phone # 803 254 6767. I may be taking<br/>\nthe presenters <br/>\nthere too Thursday--or not. We&#39;ll see.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also the Hunter-Gatherer---a micro-brewery---GREAT homemade hummus.<br/>\nALso two blocks away---but it&#39;s much smaller, and you couldn&#39;t have one big<br/>\ntable. 803 748 0540---with live jazz on Thursday nights.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext door to H-G is Miyo&#39;s---a fresh Chinese restaurant---not &quot;cooked to<br/>\ndeath&quot;. A little pricier. 803 779 6496<br/>\n<br/>\nAcross the street: Sandy&#39;s hotdogs---ultra casual, but BIG hotdogs and ice<br/>\ncream---maybe better for lunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nDomino&#39;s, too, just behind the hotel.<br/>\n<br/>\nDown the street is Immaculate Consumption---a sandwich shop. They also have<br/>\nbreakfast. Again, small and &quot;bohemian&quot;. Not for large groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, Elissa, the Basil Pot closed last month! :-(((  Maybe you want to buy<br/>\nit? &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday&#39;s is in Five Points---very casual---downhome country. Pretty<br/>\ncheap. <br/>\nA little further to drive. 803 799 0196<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll have a bunch more menus available when you get here--like last<br/>\nyear--but <br/>\nthis should get you started on Thursday.<br/>\n<br/>\n~K</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":101672438,"authorName":"Bill & Diane","from":"Bill & Diane &lt;cen46624@...&gt;","profile":"thegreatdiane","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Thursday!","postDate":"1061266533","msgId":79032,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNGNDFBNDY1LjNDRTA4MjA1QHZvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":79039,"prevInTime":79031,"nextInTime":79033,"topicId":79032,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just called the hotel to see if I could extend my reservation to Thursday and found that we re already registered for Thursday!
