He<br/>\nlived too far and the only church nearby was the Episcopalian one.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast time I stumbled on Thomas Jefferson&#39;s like the Unitarian church I found<br/>\nsome more polished entries, but these are interesting nonetheless:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sunnetworks.net/~ggarman/deist.html\">http://www.sunnetworks.net/~ggarman/deist.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFunk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary (1952) includes in the definition of<br/>\nDeist: &quot;One who believes in God but denies supernatural revelation.&quot; There<br/>\nis no question Jefferson rejected the Bible as divine revelation and<br/>\nrejected the divinity of Jesus. In the Declaration of Independence<br/>\nJefferson&#39;s appeal was to the God of the Deist, &quot;Nature&#39;s God,&quot; not<br/>\nspecifically to the God of Christianity (see letter dated Sep. 14, 1813, to<br/>\nJefferson from John Adams equating &quot;Nature&#39;s God&quot; with &quot;the revelation from<br/>\nnature&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs President, Jefferson occasionally attended church services; but, he was<br/>\nnot a communing member of any Christian church. Further, he refused to<br/>\nproclaim any national days of prayer or thanksgiving.<br/>\n<br/>\nJefferson says he was a &quot;Materialist&quot; (letter to Short, Apr. 13, 1820) and a<br/>\n&quot;Unitarian&quot; (letter to Waterhouse, Jan. 8, 1825). Jefferson rejected the<br/>\nChristian doctrine of the &quot;Trinity&quot; (letter to Derieux, Jul. 25, 1788), as<br/>\nwell as the doctrine of an eternal Hell (letter to Van der Kemp, May 1,<br/>\n1817). Further, Jefferson specifically named Joseph Priestly (English<br/>\nUnitarian who moved to America) and Conyers Middleton (English Deist) and<br/>\nsaid: &quot;I rest on them ... as the basis of my own faith&quot; (letter to Adams,<br/>\nAug. 22, 1813). Therefore, without using the actual words, Jefferson issued<br/>\nan authentic statement claiming Deism as his faith. The 1971 (ninth edition)<br/>\nEncyclopedia Britannica, 7:183, states the following: &quot;By the end of the<br/>\n18th century deism had become a dominant religious attitude among<br/>\nupper-class Americans, and the first three presidents of the United States<br/>\nheld this conviction, as is amply evidenced in their correspondence.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://216.239.33.100/search?q=cache:cmQbQN0cy0IC:members.aol.com/cwood64801\">http://216.239.33.100/search?q=cache:cmQbQN0cy0IC:members.aol.com/cwood64801</a><br/>\n/jefferson.html+jefferson+priestly+unitarian&hl=en&ie=UTF-8<br/>\n<br/>\nAtheist! Infidel! Jacobin! Jefferson&#39;s political enemies were crucifying<br/>\nhim. It was the fall of 1799 and Vice President Jefferson was running for<br/>\nPresident of the United States of America. One of his greatest political<br/>\nopponents, the Federalist Alexander Hamilton, had set the tone of the<br/>\ncampaign by using the epithet &quot;atheist&quot;, among others, to label their great<br/>\nantagonist, Thomas Jefferson.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne outraged cleric issued The Voice of Warning to Christians, on the<br/>\nensuing election of a President of the United States. He cried<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This election is not a choice between individuals or policy, but is<br/>\ninfintely more, of national regard or disregard to the religion of Jesus<br/>\nChris. Will the people choose Jefferson, a confirmed infidel? Read in his<br/>\ninfamous publicatin Notes on Virginia, of his disbelief in the Deluge, in<br/>\nhis disbelief in the story of Adam and Eve, and of his statement that &#39;It<br/>\ndoes me no injury for my neighbors to say there are twenty Gods or no God.&#39;<br/>\nChristians, if you value eternity, vote against this infidel! By voting for<br/>\nhim, you will do more to destroy the Gospel of Jesus Christ than the rest of<br/>\nthe whole fraternity of infidels with all their arts, their industry, and<br/>\ntheir intrigues.&quot; <br/>\nAnother minister wrote, &quot;I do not believe that the Most High will permit a<br/>\nhowling atheist to site at the head of this nation.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA newspaper, the New England Palladium, was even worse. It thundered<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Should the infidel Jefferson be elected to the Presidency, the seal of<br/>\ndeath will be on our holy religion, our churches will be prostrated, and<br/>\nsome infamous prostitute, under the title of the Goddess of Resaon, will<br/>\npreside in our sanctuaries, which are now devoted to worship of our Most<br/>\nHigh.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":51989482,"authorName":"rsale515@cs.com","from":"rsale515@...","profile":"rsale515","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Jesus -- Was: heaven/hell","postDate":"1028923613","msgId":40471,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3Ni5jYjBkMDA3LjJhODU3YWRkQGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":40491,"prevInTime":40470,"nextInTime":40472,"topicId":40471,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/9/2002 11:07:16 AM Pacific Daylight Time, ...

How does one separate the message <br/>\nJesus came to tell, from the words the Bible says he used? Words that to me, <br/>\nat least, are less than comforting half the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe greatest filterer of Jesus&#39; words may have been Thomas Jefferson. He <br/>\nseparated Jesus the ethicist from Jesus the metaphysician and miracle worker. <br/>\nAfter having done that, I don&#39;t think TJ would ever have considered calling <br/>\nhimself a Christian, not because he didn&#39;t follow Jesus&#39; ethical teachings, <br/>\nbut because he knew orthodoxy from heterodoxy, and realized that he was in <br/>\nthe latter camp, as were Franklin, Paine, Adams, and some others, and being <br/>\nno democrat, didn&#39;t think that 1800 years of orthodoxy should change just for <br/>\nhim. [Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I truly know of no place where <br/>\nJefferson called himself a Christian. A follower of Christ? Yes.
