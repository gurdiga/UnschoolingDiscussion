Partly because there were already &quot;enough&quot; flute players, and partly because I had a little trouble getting air over the mouthpiece of a flute right off the bat with the &quot;testing.&quot; Looking back, I don&#39;t think it was a fair system, although I understand the whys of it and everything...trying to have a balanced band (the 7th grade beginner band was looked at as training specifically for the 8th grade competitive band rather than simply kids who wanted to play music for the sake of it). <br/>\n <br/>\nI hadn&#39;t really thought about any other instrument but the flute, but I didn&#39;t mind the trumpet. Particularly when, on the first day of class, I found myself sitting in 7th chair because all the boys (I was the ONLY girl in the entire brass section, let alone playing the trumpet!) had had summer band and could already play a little. They gave me a hard time that day saying I didn&#39;t belong there, couldn&#39;t play, would never be able to, etc. It took me two weeks just to be able to get a clear, sustained F. But by the end of the semester, guess who was not only sitting in the first chair but had been asked to sit second chair in the 8th grade band (technically first trumpet, as the kid in first chair actually played cornet)? The challenge of it all helped LOL...telling me that I couldn&#39;t do it since I was &quot;just&quot; a girl! <br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\nMark and Rheta Wallingford &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wallingford@...\">wallingford@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nLaura wrote<br/>\n&quot;This is a little OT but I could never understand when a child was asked<br/>\nto <br/>\nchoose another instrument because they already had enough kids playing<br/>\nof what <br/>\nthe child wanted to play.&amp;nbsp; What if they did have their heart<br/>\nset on <br/>\nplaying the clarinet and were asked to switch to the flute?
