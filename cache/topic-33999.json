The daughter told her, &quot;These are not things that<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; ask people like me. I&#39;m only 13 years old, for heaven&#39;s sake.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Neely told the pediatrician how offended she was and that she did not<br/>\n&gt; appreciate the office giving anything to her daughter behind her back.<br/>\n&gt; The doctor replied, according to Neely, state law requires that all<br/>\nchildren<br/>\n&gt; are treated as if they are promiscuous and doctors have every right to<br/>\noffer<br/>\n&gt; sexual advice, birth control, etc. without parental permission.<br/>\n&gt; Neely says, &quot;I am so sickened. My daughter is a sweet, innocent girl who<br/>\n&gt; believes in God and never even dreamed of the horrible things she was<br/>\nasked.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; She said her daughter has attended a Christian school in New Hampshire<br/>\nsince<br/>\n&gt; fifth grade.<br/>\n&gt; The form asks for information about guns in the home, fighting in the<br/>\nhome,<br/>\n&gt; friends&#39; behavior, sex and drug activity, etc.<br/>\n&gt; Nev Moore from the parents&#39; rights group, Justice for Families, tells<br/>\n&gt; MassNews, &quot;This questionnaire is not only invasive, it is deliberately<br/>\n&gt; designed to undermine parental authority and decision-making, without the<br/>\n&gt; parents even being aware of it. In addition, it is a sneaky device used to<br/>\n&gt; manipulate children to unwittingly disclose information about their homes<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; parents that can then be distorted and used to open the door for the state<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; enter our homes and lives and take control of them.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Not State Law<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; MassNews was interested in finding out what state law mandates an<br/>\nintrusive<br/>\n&gt; questionnaire to a young girl at the doctor&#39;s office without her parent&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; knowledge. We also wanted to know what the relevance some of the questions<br/>\n&gt; were to a check-up, and whether DSS was behind this form in any way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The pediatrician, Dr. Miriam Dunau, did not return repeated calls from<br/>\n&gt; MassNews seeking comment. MassNews even visited her office, but she would<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; come out to discuss the matter. The receptionist gave the reporter the<br/>\nname<br/>\n&gt; and contact number for &quot;Neal Stephany,&quot; the supervisor located at another<br/>\n&gt; office. Pediatric Health Care Associates has 6 offices in the area.<br/>\nStephany<br/>\n&gt; would not return calls either. The head of nursing, Ann Costa, also did<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; return calls.<br/>\n&gt; MassNews called the Mass. Board of Registration in Medicine, which<br/>\nregulates<br/>\n&gt; doctors, to find out if there is a requirement to interrogate children<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; an intrusive questionnaire.<br/>\n&gt; Spokesperson Claudette Houle told MassNews the Board of Registration does<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; have any regulation associated with teen questionnaires.<br/>\n&gt; According to Neely, Dr. Dunau later called her and said it was<br/>\ninappropriate<br/>\n&gt; to send a reporter to &quot;harass&quot; her and turn the incident into a big<br/>\ncircus.<br/>\n&gt; Neely answered that it was inappropriate for the doctor to give an<br/>\nintrusive<br/>\n&gt; questionnaire to her daughter behind her back.<br/>\n&gt; According to Neely, the doctor then told her she must have misunderstood<br/>\n&gt; about the form or else Dunau didn&#39;t explain it right during their argument<br/>\n&gt; that day. The questionnaire, she said, was a clinic form and not required<br/>\nby<br/>\n&gt; state law. She said the law does permit them to ask about and dispense<br/>\n&gt; contraceptives, and if she objects to the questions on the form, she has<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; right to go elsewhere.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;She changed her story,&quot; said Neely, who is considering filing a complaint<br/>\n&gt; with the Board of Registration in Medicine. &quot;All of a sudden there is no<br/>\n&gt; state law.&quot; She said she not only objects to the questions, but at the<br/>\nvery<br/>\n&gt; top of the form they go behind her back.<br/>\n&gt; Neely says, &quot;Now my eyes are open.&quot; She hopes other parents will also be<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; the lookout for snooping by their doctors. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33994,"nextTopicId":34020}}
