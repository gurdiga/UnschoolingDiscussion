It&#39;s <br/>\nnever been necessary, though.  The first statement was an projection <br/>\nof a future event that may or may not take place; the second <br/>\nstatement was a commitment to a specific action, a promise to do <br/>\nsomething, on which other people would reasonably rely and depend <br/>\non.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Should <br/>\n&gt; I try to somehow persuade her to say something and stick to it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What could you persuade her to say?

But if they were talking <br/>\nabout applying to $40k a year Ivy League college, than I think they&#39;d <br/>\nhave to be a lot more serious about wanting it in order to go through <br/>\nall the application and cost hoops necessary to get there. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think some of it would dalso epend on how much of it she was going <br/>\nto cover cost-wise, how much was refundable if she decided to drop <br/>\nclasses, etc. I&#39;d be pretty unwilling to shuck out a lot of non-<br/>\nrefundable dollars if a kid wasn&#39;t pretty committed to going. But I&#39;d <br/>\nbe more likely to do a trial effort of a certain number of classes. <br/>\nOf course, if she&#39;s paying for the whole thing, then it&#39;s really her <br/>\ndecision completely. <br/>\n<br/>\nI went to college early and for me it was a very good decision. Of <br/>\ncourse, my parents weren&#39;t able to help me out financially, so it was <br/>\ncompletely up to me to get scholarships set up, apply for more <br/>\nscholarships, financial aid, etc. and work 2 or 3 jobs at a time to <br/>\npay for it. So it was totally my responsibility, and thus I was <br/>\npretty invested in making sure I got the most out of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be a lot different if a child was expecting a parent <br/>\nto pay for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Most times I think I should honor her request, other times I think <br/>\n </span></blockquote>it&#39;s wrong <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to jump back into the classroom, for lots of reasons, then I think <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am just <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; being selfish because we are having too much fun right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I guess the question is why is it up to you to &quot;honor&quot; her request or <br/>\nnot. Is she asking for funding or transportation from you? If so, are <br/>\nyou able to provide them? If providing funding or trasporation is a <br/>\nbasic problem, then you&#39;d probably want to discuss that and make sure <br/>\nshe is serious. If not, why not let her play around with it? I guess <br/>\nI see unschooling as supporting my kids decisions to the best of my <br/>\nability. Sometimes, as with funding and transportation issues, that&#39;s <br/>\nnot possible. Then we have to figure out what will work best to meet <br/>\nas many of the needs as possible.
