Yes, sometimes they do need to cry<br/>\nin your arms. My oldest daughter sometimes needed to cry for over an hour at<br/>\na time when she was 2, for longer when she was an infant. There is a<br/>\nbrilliant woman, Aletha Solter, who has written a number of books on the<br/>\nsubject of why children (humans!) need to cry, with someone who loves them<br/>\nlistening. Her web site is &quot;Aware Parenting&quot;, and there&#39;s also The Parent<br/>\nLeadership Institute, which was founded by Patty Wipfler, another brilliant<br/>\nparent. I have met both of these women, and Aletha&#39;s children, and raised<br/>\nall 3 of my beautiful children using this way of parenting. That&#39;s all...<br/>\nRobyn<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn,<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to thank you for the information about the Aware Parenting website. I<br/>\nhad to do a search with Google to find it.

I had it on my<br/>\nbookshelf and about 8 years ago I lent it to a young woman friend who had<br/>\njust had a baby. I never got it back.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot only did I read the book, but I put it into practice with all my babies.<br/>\nUpon birth, we practiced the family bed, nursing, holding and listening. My<br/>\nmother would have a &#39;silent&#39; fit, she would stick her head in the room and<br/>\nthere I was holding my baby and listening to him/her cry after birth. Oh,<br/>\ndid I mention that I birthed at home too?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow else can babies communicate if not by crying, especially right after<br/>\nbirth.  I never made my kids be quite when they cried, I just listened.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for attachment parenting, I will admit that I never understood the term<br/>\ntill now. I thought it was some strange cult type thing. Low and behold,<br/>\nI&#39;ve always done attachment parenting, now I have a name for what I thought<br/>\nwas just natural.
