She&#39;s leaving Minneapolis on a greyhound bus and going out to Eugene, OR, to visit a friend for a couple of weeks. Then she&#39;s using a 30-day Amtrak pass to go wherever the mood takes her around the country. She&#39;ll be staying in hostels mostly, and says she wants the experience of arriving in a city in the morning w/o knowing where she&#39;ll be staying or what she&#39;ll discover. Sounds nice and adventurous to a stranger, but a bit frightening to a parent!<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also is very social and loves to speak in front of groups, and this is the dd who hid behind me and was an appendage until she was about 8 years old. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe took a shorter trip a little more than a year ago and I asked this list for advice. Do you have any more? (Maybe for me, on how not to worry....) Any other young travelers out there?<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8863,"nextTopicId":8865}}
