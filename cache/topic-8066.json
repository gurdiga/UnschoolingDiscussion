We had a wonderful time. I was a bit sorry that my homeschooling/unschooling comments didn t make it into the show but then again","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1294345890\">Hello all,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for asking. We had a wonderful time. I was a bit sorry that my <br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling comments didn&#39;t make it into the show but then <br/>\nagain I really didn&#39;t expect them to.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, Tara and I had a great flight into Chicago. I was sitting right <br/>\nnext to an American Airline pilot and when he heard Tara being a bit <br/>\nnervous, he guaranteed her he could fly the plane if need be. This was her <br/>\nfirst time flying. He was real nice and put her mind at ease.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe arrived in Chicago at around 2:40 their time. A greeter from the show was <br/>\nalready there to meet us. By the time we got outside, our limo was waiting. <br/>\nOf course it was a major shock when we walked outside. Tara and I <br/>\ninstinctively screamed with the cold!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we were driving to the city, I saw little flecks flying by and asked if <br/>\nit was snowing. Tara has never seen snow. Well it was rather wet and hail <br/>\nlike but still exciting for Tara. We get to the Omni Hotel, check in and get <br/>\nour food vouchers and go to our room to get ready for our cold trek outside. <br/>\nWell by the time we got outside to do some shopping and look around, it was <br/>\nsnowing. And I mean snowing! The heavens opened up with big fluffy <br/>\nsnowflakes just like a movie. Tara was so happy. It was like it snowed just <br/>\nfor her. The more we walked, the harder it snowed. Everything was decorated <br/>\nfor Christmas and there were horse drawn buggies along the streets and <br/>\nlights and it was just gorgeous!!! We had such fun and we were covered in <br/>\nsnow. We were freezing but happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWent back to the hotel and changed and went and had dinner there. Went back <br/>\nto ur room and relaxed the rest of the evening. The limo was picking us up <br/>\nat 7:30 the next morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe drive to the studio was about 15-20 minutes. We shared the limo with <br/>\nanother couple that was going to be on the show. Very nice people and we had <br/>\nfun. Everyone at the studio was real nice. Of course I had to leave my <br/>\ncamera at the door and also cell phone. Very strict there they were.<br/>\n<br/>\nRay, the producer of our segment met us and showed Tara and I the studio <br/>\nbefore anyone was in it. He was so nice to us. We chatted with the other <br/>\nguests and had our hair and make up done. Believe me when I say they <br/>\ncertainly weren&#39;t Oprah�s makeup and hair people. I would have been better <br/>\noff doing it myself. I swear they pulled two people in off the streets. <br/>\nThat�s why I look a little peeked in the studio and not on the film clip.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we�re out in the studio and the guy that warms up the audience was <br/>\nhysterical!! We enjoyed that part of the show. I was still fine and it never <br/>\nreally dawned on me what was going on until I actually saw Oprah walk out. <br/>\nThat�s the first time I actually realized what we were doing!!! But I wasn�t <br/>\nnervous at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were both very happy with the way Ray put everything together from when <br/>\nhe was at the house. There were just a few things cut out from the original <br/>\nshow we did with Oprah. She had asked Tara a question that didn�t make it in <br/>\nthe final show and her two questions to me were incorporated into one <br/>\ninstead. Over all, we were very happy with the way things went and when we <br/>\nactually saw the show on Tuesday, both of us were very pleased. I was like a <br/>\nlittle kid yelling �There I am� and then �There I am again!!!� Ray sat me in <br/>\na good place, the back of my head got a lot of exposure!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went back to the hotel, changed and had lunch at the hotel and then went <br/>\non our shopping trek again. It was even colder on Monday afternoon than it <br/>\nwas Sunday night and Tara I didn�t make it far at all. We wanted to see the <br/>\nSears Tower and also the lake. Forget about it!!!! We were walking into <br/>\nstores just to thaw out. It was very uncomfortable. We practically ran back <br/>\nto the hotel and thawed out again for an hour until our limo came to pick us <br/>\nup.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the airport we checked our bags and hung out as we had an hour to kill. <br/>\nWe loved the airport there and just browsed around some more and ate. On our <br/>\nflight home, we flew with Venus and Serena Williams. Tara had no clue who <br/>\nthey were when she saw them. A very nice flight followed and it was all new <br/>\nagain for Tara as it was a night flight. The lights all look so nice. Joe <br/>\nwas there to meet us at the airport with all the kids. I was surprised as he <br/>\nsaid he would just pick us up outside. The baby was just so happy to see us <br/>\nas the other two were too.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, now for the part no one probably really wants to hear. Ready?<br/>\n<br/>\nMiss Oprah is a bit of a snoot. And that�s putting it mildly and nicely. I <br/>\ncan�t honestly say we actually met her as she never came near us. No nice <br/>\nwords of thanks for coming on the show, no handshake, nothing. Absolutely <br/>\nnothing aside from what you saw if you watched the show. When they break <br/>\naway for a commercial, she sits up there on her little perch and talks to <br/>\nonly her people or herself. She makes herself laugh a lot and we heard the <br/>\nsame joke over three times while she was up there. When she does ask you <br/>\nsomething on the show, she immediately looks away from you to the monitor <br/>\nand solely concentrates on the teleprompter. It�s evident when you watch the <br/>\nshow but more so when you are there. She also made a remark about being so <br/>\nrich she has people now. She had something in her eye and called her make up <br/>\nguy from backstage, actually yelled for him clapping her hands and out he <br/>\ncame running to remove whatever it was that was bothering her. She talked <br/>\nabout how she use to have to remove things from her eyes herself before and <br/>\nnow she has �people� do it for her. It just didn�t sit right with Tara and <br/>\nI. Everyone laughed of course but another remark about her staff made me <br/>\nthink she must be hell to work for unless you are high up in the scale. So <br/>\nMiss Oprah is not big on our nice list anymore. When we left, we got a <br/>\npublic thank you from the stage on air but nothing else. No picture, no <br/>\nhandshake, no video tape of our show, just two Oprah coffee mugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily it was only a few hours out of our trip and we did really enjoy the <br/>\nshow and being there and the whole experience. We were just disappointed to <br/>\nfind Oprah not as friendly as we thought she would be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;t my experience. And it was certainly that and a good one too. <br/>\nThanks for asking and I hope everyone has a Happy Thanksgiving.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of spam?

School wasn&#39;t a safe haven for everybody, but<br/>\na place where you were forced to go where you felt your worst, not best.<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n  -----<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"ambersand","from":"&quot;ambersand&quot; &lt;ambersand@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"eElrCsyI3cufMiqyLdcFKbULLk0tH9JX12byKCn2kzGQK1DB1ZEcF9RW1rt0ByaW_06QNClwCJtQ4qpbt66d2BH1XW6n7awcc2TKSVYRhK8","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Oprah","postDate":"988808503","msgId":20290,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlkLjAyMDUyMDAxMDkwMTQzLjAwMDAwQEZQRT4="},"prevInTopic":8066,"nextInTopic":20302,"prevInTime":20289,"nextInTime":20291,"topicId":8066,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maybe the reason she doesn t get homeschooling is that no homeschoolers are watching.

If so were <br/>\nyou as disappointed as I was? I love Oprah, but I really didn&#39;t need to hear <br/>\nsome &quot;expert&quot; tell me that most parents aren&quot;t &quot;qualified&quot; to teach their <br/>\nown children! Or to see a Homeschooling mom talk about giving her kids the <br/>\nIowa basics test to make them ready for the &quot;real world&quot;. Maybe I&#39;m not <br/>\nbeing fair, I only saw the second half of the show, but to me it did not put <br/>\nhomeschooling in a very positive light. And unschooling wasn&#39;t even <br/>\nmentioned. Do you mean to tell me they were not contacted by ANY <br/>\nunschoolers? This is one of those things that started to make me doubt <br/>\nmyself, then it just made me angry!<br/>\n    Thanks for letting me vent! Any way I&#39;d like to hear if anyone else had <br/>\nany thoughts on the show.<br/>\n                                  Trisha<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50828,"nextTopicId":50837}}
