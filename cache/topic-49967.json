And even<br/>\n&gt; more ironically, we serendipitously (though unfortunately before I&#39;d gotten<br/>\n&gt; around to playing the CD for Kathryn) ended up in Stockbridge a couple days<br/>\n&gt; later where &quot;Alice&#39;s restaurant&quot; was. Had I known we&#39;d be there and had<br/>\n&gt; looked up the trivia about the song we could have seen the church (now<br/>\n&gt; Guthrie Center) and the 8x10 color glossies (that were actually black and<br/>\n&gt; white). And I can&#39;t figure out if the restaurant in the center that was<br/>\n&gt; &quot;formerly Alice&#39;s Restaurant&quot; (closed either for the season or permanently<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t clear) was Alice&#39;s restaurant. (Alice&#39;s restaurant refered to in the<br/>\n&gt; song was called The Wooden Spoon I think.) It&#39;s down an alley and not<br/>\n&gt; &quot;around the back&quot; as in the song.
