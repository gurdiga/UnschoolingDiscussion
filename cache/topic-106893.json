The advice was, drink only <br/>\ndistilled water, until they discovered that doing so saps the cells of all <br/>\ntheir electrolytes and salts, causing an imbalance that could kill you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMan, the things that are put out there as facts.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, heidC whose preferred liquid is WATER.

I&#39;ve been amused  and disgusted<br/>\n&gt;through these last few water-worshipping years about how much  water people <br/>\n&gt;were<br/>\n&gt;supposed to drink (also a &quot;truth&quot; rescinded lately) and they&#39;d  say &quot;tea<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t count.&quot;   Tea is just water that leaves soaked  in.  Puhleeeze.   <br/>\n&gt;People<br/>\n&gt;shouldn&#39;t be so gullible, and maybe  scientists are lately as gullible and<br/>\n&gt;misguided as anyone.<br/>\n&gt;Sandra<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106763,"nextTopicId":106901}}
