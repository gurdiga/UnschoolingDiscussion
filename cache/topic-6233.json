I have a huge collection of books from Dorling-Kindersley (DK).<br/>\nYou might not recognize the name, but you&#39;d recognize the books in the<br/>\nstore. They are filled with wonderful photographs, lots of facts, and are<br/>\nvery interesting! As for &quot;quick question answers&quot; - I have their<br/>\nencyclopedia. I own Encarta on CD, and always said I&#39;d never purchase an<br/>\nencyclopedia in print after they came out with update-able CDs, but I bought<br/>\nthis one - it has so many great photographs, and whenever we look something<br/>\nup, we end up stopping at another dozen pages along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, books I am reading myself - I have always been a big Michael<br/>\nCrichton fan, and after finishing &quot;Timeline&quot; earlier than expected on a<br/>\nrecent trip, I picked up a book of his called &quot;Travels&quot; - stories about the<br/>\nplaces he has traveled. Very interesting and well written!  I just started<br/>\nJohn Grisham&#39;s &quot;Brethren&quot; too.  I am also reading &quot;Seasons of a Mother&#39;s<br/>\nHeart,&quot; by Sally Clarkson (great book for anyone who is a mother, a<br/>\nChristian and/or a homeschooler).  I&#39;m about to read &quot;Carolinas & Georgia&quot;<br/>\nby Frommer&#39;s, since I&#39;m going to Myrtle Beach for a week on Feb. 19.  Next<br/>\non my list are &quot;Honey, Are You Listening? - How Attention Deficit Disorder<br/>\nCould Be Affecting Your Marriage,&quot; by Dr. Rick Fowler & Jerilyn Fowler, and<br/>\n&quot;Watch It Made in the USA - a Visitor&#39;s Guide to the Companies That Make<br/>\nYour Favorite Products,&quot; by Bruce Brumberg & Karen Axelrod.  My daughter and<br/>\nI are also reading the second Harry Potter book together (by J.K. Rowling).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last item - my family and I just got back from a 2-week trip to Arizona.<br/>\nI always keep a travel journal when we travel, for family memories, as well<br/>\nas our homeschooling portfolio.  It&#39;s 44 pages in Microsoft Word - if you&#39;re<br/>\ninterested, I could either post it to the whole group, or email it to<br/>\nindividuals.  Let me know if you&#39;d like to read it!<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin<br/>\nOrlando, FL<br/>\n :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A room without books is like a body without a soul.&quot;  -Cicero<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, February 06, 2000 6:26 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 404<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Love.

Most people when they speak<br/>\n&gt;   of attachment parenting, they are talking about a lifestyle term that<br/>\n&gt;   was coined by Dr. Bill and Martha Sears, pediatrician, La Leche<br/>\n&gt;   League Leader and parents to eight children.  Many people think<br/>\n&gt;   of AP (attachment parenting) as natural parenting, and often this<br/>\n&gt;   type of parenting can be found in non-industrialized cultures and<br/>\n&gt;   considered the norm.  Most Americans practicing AP start from<br/>\n&gt;   birth, looking to birth their children in the gentle environment,<br/>\n&gt;   breastfeeding and sleep sharing, and carrying your baby/child in<br/>\n&gt;   a sling or in arms.  Crying it out and physical punishment<br/>\n&gt;   are not considered AP.  You do not have to have done all of the<br/>\n&gt;   above practices to be AP I believe, (example; some women may not have<br/>\nhad<br/>\n&gt;   all the correct information or support to breastfeed their child, but<br/>\npractice<br/>\n&gt;   other attachment/bonding practices).  In turn these practices help you<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt;   your child become in tune with each other, so you can better parent etc.<br/>\n&gt;   There are tons of sites on the<br/>\n&gt;   web where you can learn more about this.  Hope this helps! ps. I think<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt;   homeschooling/unschooling is a very natural progression from and early<br/>\n&gt;   APing lifestyle.<br/>\n&gt;   Kathy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n&gt;   Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt;   Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 4<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 5 Feb 2000 12:55:34 EST<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Natrlmama@...\">Natrlmama@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Gardening Zones<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 02/03/2000 10:31:39 AM Pacific Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hooperck@...\">hooperck@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;  All you gardening people, I stumbled into a great newsletter from<br/>\n&gt;  Organic Gardening.

Our discussions over the<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; years have shown that it was much more traumatic than I realized for<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; even though they adjusted okay.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Yes, already I have become faintly aware of this. Our 12yo who has<br/>\nwanted for<br/>\n&gt;   always to move to the country, started exhibiting strange behaviour, and<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt;   emerged that although he loves living here, he was still going through a<br/>\nmajor<br/>\n&gt;   grieving for all that has been his life until now, and has been left<br/>\nbehind. The<br/>\n&gt;   2 that weren&#39;t that keen on moving seem almost to be handling it<br/>\nbetter -<br/>\n&gt;   perhaps their low expectations enabled them to be pleasantly surprised!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; I had tried to keep them aware of all<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; plans, choices, etc during the change, but they still felt they had no<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; choice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I do feel bad about this - children have so little choice really, in so<br/>\nmany<br/>\n&gt;   areas of their lives. Even when we, as individual families, allow our<br/>\nchildren<br/>\n&gt;   choice, they soon become aware that other families don&#39;t work like that,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt;   that their choice is only theirs by virtue of our choice to allow it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; I always found life in general to be a balancing act.  Home birth,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; attachment parenting, homeschooling, all of these things that grow<br/>\nchildren<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; so well, and have the potential to grow parents well, too, can also be<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; draining if you don&#39;t find the balance that you need.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Yeah, and I&#39;ve never been to good at balancing - I always did choose the<br/>\nswing<br/>\n&gt;   rather than the seesaw at the playground &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Carol<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n&gt;   Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt;   Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 7<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 5 Feb 2000 18:55:17 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Tracy@...\">Tracy@...</a>-online.co.uk&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Books<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have an Iain M Banks novel sitting on the office windowsill waiting to<br/>\nbe read :-)  I bought it for Father&#39;s Day (or birthday, can&#39;t remember which<br/>\n:-) ) last year, and dh loved it, but I&#39;ve yet to read it :-)  I need to<br/>\nstart reading breastfeeding and ap-type books again, since my LLL<br/>\napplication is getting a kick up the bottom now &lt;g&gt;  I have a second-hand<br/>\ncopy of a book on gardening with mulch, rather than compost, which I like, I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s called the No Work Garden, or something like that!  (On the side<br/>\ntopic of gardening, I got the phone number today of someone local who<br/>\nsupplies mushroom compost for gardens, will be phoning them on Monday...)<br/>\nThe last book I read was A Little Princess, I think, oh, hang on, no it was<br/>\na Terry Pratchett Discworld novel from the library!  Anything else?  Don&#39;t<br/>\nthink so!  99.9% of our books are packed up in boxes in the garage or at my<br/>\nmother&#39;s since moving last year, so when I get them out again, I may be<br/>\nreading some more.

I also love to read the Emily<br/>\n&gt;   Pollifax series.  Why can&#39;t I think of the author??<br/>\n&gt;   I think outside of mystery I really love May Sarton.  I think she has<br/>\n&gt;   one called &quot;Full Circle&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;   Right now I&#39;m reading a book by the Dali Lama or rather a phd and him<br/>\n&gt;   called &quot;The Art of Happiness&quot;.

I met a mom who is very proud that her kids<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kindergarten class is so strict bc the children know what the rules<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are????<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i went to a b-day party for a 4 yo recently,  all the other kids there met<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; daycare,  we were the only homeschoolers.  i found the dynamic between the<br/>\n&gt; parents and kids really distant, not without love but without closeness.<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; parent would stand back and say things like &#39;now uses your words&#39; and the<br/>\n&gt; kids would be fighting over the toys.  it was odd to me (not the fighting<br/>\n&gt; part:),  the kids do their thing and the parents do theirs and &#39;never the<br/>\n&gt; &#39;twain shall meet&#39; just bridged by a bit of vocalization.  it made me<br/>\nthink<br/>\n&gt; that people keep themselves so busy so they don&#39;t have to see what&#39;s<br/>\nreally<br/>\n&gt; happening and if something bad happens they have a good excuse - they were<br/>\n&gt; too busy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i have a thing about controlling kids.  boundaries are great but control<br/>\nis a<br/>\n&gt;

-i&#39;m not completely convinced he clearly<br/>\n&gt; understands what that is &lt;lol&gt;) or the most obedient or the kid with the<br/>\nbest<br/>\n&gt; manners or any other of their silly accolades.  i did gave birth to<br/>\n&gt; experience the joy of watching a person develop and find happiness in<br/>\ntheir<br/>\n&gt; everyday life and to be of whatever assistance i am able.  i believe<br/>\n&gt; compassion and good manners are very helpful but only if it is done with<br/>\n&gt; sincerity not coercion.  this is my problem with schools.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i would be interested in how others step out of the way of their kids and<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; pass on all the issue based in social conformity.  from what i&#39;ve seen<br/>\nsome<br/>\n&gt; of the greatest injustices perpetrated against kids is in the name of<br/>\nsocial<br/>\n&gt; conformity.  my son is out spoken - for the good or the bad - i make sure<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; knows his voice carries weight.  i also let him know when he&#39;s driving me<br/>\n&gt; nuts with his incessant talking.   i do not use the word &#39;incessant&#39;<br/>\nlightly<br/>\n&gt; - he will talk to anyone anytime for as long as they will sit there.  i<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; not even count the number of picnics of total strangers (more often than<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; adult only) he has invited himself to.  he just parks himself without ever<br/>\n&gt; questioning whether he would be wanted, in his mind of course they would<br/>\nwant<br/>\n&gt; to hear what he has to say:)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i am not embarrassed by anything he does.  at first i was tempted to feel<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; was a reflection of me and i would be judged by other because of his<br/>\n&gt; behavior,  but you know so what.  i know people judge,  their thoughts are<br/>\n&gt; so &#39;loud&#39; you can&#39;t help but know.  what i&#39;ve found is,  trying to control<br/>\n&gt; (the use of rules) kids or anyone,  sets you up for a power struggle then<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; have to ask yourself &#39;is this really the kind of relationship i want?&#39; and<br/>\n&#39;<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t this just what i have with my parents (or any other person trying to<br/>\n&gt; have power of you)?&#39;  for me the answers are no and yes respectively.  so<br/>\ni<br/>\n&gt; accept that i&#39;m breaking with all my &#39;role models&#39; and that leaves me with<br/>\n&gt; always (at least for now:) having to know why i do what i do and making<br/>\n&gt; conscious choices so i don&#39;t fall back into repeating what was done to me<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; i must afford this right to my kids.  now that i&#39;ve been able to make the<br/>\n&gt; transition i feel life doesn&#39;t need to be scheduled or planned or have a<br/>\n&gt; curriculum to succeed and prosper and be happy but just conscious and<br/>\nsincere<br/>\n&gt; involvement is needed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; the other thing i wanted to touch on is that there has been a lot of<br/>\n&gt; discussion about waldorf, which to be honest i only lightly touched on as<br/>\nfar<br/>\n&gt; as reading the emails.  it&#39;s not a big interest of mine though they do<br/>\n&gt; provide nice products albeit a bit expensive but very good quality.   i<br/>\n&gt; looked into becoming a waldorf teacher when i lived in northern cal.  but<br/>\n&gt; backed away.  for me it&#39;s too structured and imposes a reality on to the<br/>\n&gt; environment rather than allowing one to develop of it&#39;s own accord.   i&#39;m<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; as well read on the specific differences between these philosophies<br/>\nbecause i<br/>\n&gt; make mine up as i go and find i&#39;m much happier doing it that way.   it&#39;s<br/>\nhard<br/>\n&gt; for me to conform to even the alternative methods and this is why i&#39;m on<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; list because for me unschooling is more of a philosophical base and<br/>\nmethods<br/>\n&gt; such as waldorf are more of a structure you &#39;live&#39; in.  just some thoughts<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;  I also know two hs families who live right next to a school.

I would have preferred to become a Waldorf teacher as opposed<br/>\nto a regular elem. teacher in the olden days because I would have liked to<br/>\nfurther develop that artist that I was ( I realize I still can blossom at<br/>\nhome along side my own children) I think lots of parents have trouble out<br/>\nthere in Waldorf land and still have to worry about the &quot;waldorf police&quot; who<br/>\nhave in some cases literally gone after them! I had a bad experience looking<br/>\ninto being a teacher at Antioch was totally dissed by the woman who ran the<br/>\nprogram and I was over the age of 35 at the time I looked into it.<br/>\n&gt; I have also gone to Hampshire College a great place for nonconforming<br/>\n&#39;unschoolers&quot; if you can afford it. I think they give scholarships nowadays.<br/>\nI had trouble with the drug culture that was there but hopefully those days<br/>\nare gone.<br/>\n&gt; Tell us more about your son he sounds so vibrant and full of self esteem!<br/>\n&gt; Beth<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 16<br/>\n&gt;    Date: 6 Feb 2000 01:31:58 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heathfam@...\">heathfam@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Joshua<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi all....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ( hey Lyn ;-))<br/>\n&gt;  I just want to introduce myself here....<br/>\n&gt;  My name is Joshua and I have two boys going on 6 and 8 who &quot;unschool&quot;<br/>\n&gt; as near as I can tell.

Andersen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andersen@...\">andersen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: We Want Our Children to Be Suckers!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We Want Our Children to Be Suckers!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes.  That&#39;s right.  We hope our children become real suckers.  And we<br/>\nalso<br/>\n&gt; want them to be suck-sessful adults.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We derived our non-traditional definition of sucker from Henry David<br/>\nThoreau<br/>\n&gt; &#39;s words in his classic Walden.  He wrote that he &quot;...went to the woods to<br/>\n&gt; live deliberately...to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A sucker single-mindedly goes after that marrow.  A sucker hungers for<br/>\n&gt; knowledge.  A sucker notes the changes of seasons, the migration of birds,<br/>\n&gt; the budding of flowers, the artistry of the morning dew.  A sucker is as<br/>\n&gt; comfortable with the technology of the present as the wisdom of the ages.<br/>\nA<br/>\n&gt; sucker is deeply moved in the face of human triumph or tragedy.  A sucker<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; all there, fully awake, completely embracing all that life has to offer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sound like a worthy goal for children?  We think so.  Here are three steps<br/>\n&gt; to help children learn to be suckers:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Be a sucker yourself<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Model a passion for learning.  Be open-minded.  Try new things all of the<br/>\n&gt; time.  Focus on stockpiling experiences rather than material objects.<br/>\n&gt; Travel slowly, stopping and lingering along the way.  Chat with the people<br/>\n&gt; you meet.  Savor your food.  Don&#39;t jump to conclusions.  Pick the minds of<br/>\n&gt; people who know the ropes.  Enjoy sunrises and sunsets. Become adept at<br/>\n&gt; looking through telescopes, microscopes, and just under your nose.  When<br/>\n&gt; your children see how much fun you&#39;re having, nothing will stop them from<br/>\n&gt; joining in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Give children time and space<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Overscheduling our children&#39;s lives may make them into &quot;successes&quot; in the<br/>\n&gt; eyes of the world, but it won&#39;t help them to be suckers. For that you&#39;ve<br/>\ngot<br/>\n&gt; to leave them alone.  Let them build their play forts, play their street<br/>\n&gt; games, and experiment in the kitchen.  Encourage creativity.  Expose them<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; the very best in life and let them choose what they want.  Give them the<br/>\n&gt; tinder and matches, but let them light their own fires of passion.  The<br/>\n&gt; ability to suck the marrow out of life comes slowly over many years.  So<br/>\ndon<br/>\n&gt; &#39;t expect immediate, quantifiable results.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Seek inspiration from other suckers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mandy and I place our faith in the premise that &quot;a sucker is born every<br/>\n&gt; minute.&quot;  We believe that everyone can be a sucker, but too many get lured<br/>\n&gt; away from that. They may be led to believe that happiness has to do with<br/>\n&gt; money, status, or position.  Far too often those pursuits engulf lives,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; distract would-be suckers from the path.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On a positive note, you can find real suckers everywhere.  They are the<br/>\nones<br/>\n&gt; who are involved and active.  They are multi-faceted people, always<br/>\n&gt; learning, always growing, always changing.  Such people need to be  your<br/>\n&gt; lifelines.  You can also read about great suckers in history; people who<br/>\ndid<br/>\n&gt; extraordinary things, who were committed to living each day to the<br/>\nfullest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The lifelong quest<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Suck-sess has to do with cutting through the veneer of life and getting at<br/>\n&gt; its essence.  It has to do with throwing out agendas and living<br/>\n&gt; spontaneously.   It&#39;s about bringing our exterior world in harmony with<br/>\nour<br/>\n&gt; interior.  It&#39;s about reducing our baggage.  It&#39;s about getting wrapped up<br/>\n&gt; in the ecstasy of the moment rather than postponing happiness for a later<br/>\n&gt; date.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a nutshell, suck-sess is the nectar of life.  That&#39;s why we&#39;re so<br/>\nintent<br/>\n&gt; on teaching our children how to be real suckers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; John Andersen is a professional &quot;rug sucker&quot; (carpet cleaner) in Portland,<br/>\n&gt; Oregon.

I am moving a sofa and loveseat to the<br/>\nden<br/>\n&gt; and adding some bookshelves...and I wanted to get some books that are more<br/>\n&gt; like reference books rite now...such as a basic math book...that can help<br/>\nme<br/>\n&gt; and the boys understand what we are learning...not so much a text<br/>\nbook...but<br/>\n&gt; like a how to book...if that makes sense and I also want to get a book on<br/>\n&gt; grammar that explains all the &#39;rules&#39; so that we can understand them...I<br/>\nhad<br/>\n&gt; one a while back when I did alot of writing and aspired to be a sci fi and<br/>\n&gt; fantasy author (I have some great ideas)...now I got the APA manual on how<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; write journal articles related to the medical and nursing fields (a<br/>\n&gt; requirement for college)  now I just want something basic that is easy to<br/>\n&gt; understand that can answer on the spot questions...as for science and<br/>\nsocial<br/>\n&gt; studies and other educational &#39;requirements&#39;...well I don&#39;t feel that<br/>\nthere<br/>\n&gt; is any one book we should have so I plan on acquiring whatever seems<br/>\n&gt; interesting at the time...there are some field trips planned in the near<br/>\n&gt; future (especially around paydays) to several of the local bookstores...(w<br/>\nink)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So far the hardest thing has been sharing my computer with the boys...but<br/>\n&gt; since I have a laptop as well as a pc...that isn&#39;t as hard as I thought it<br/>\n&gt; would be...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am having fun and wish that I had gotten the inspiration for this<br/>\ndesision<br/>\n&gt; a year or so ago...but as I place my faith in God...God brings into our<br/>\nlife<br/>\n&gt; what we need when we need it...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This afternoon...the boys again asked...&quot;When does homeschool start?&quot;  so<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; asked<br/>\n&gt; what is homeschool and we talked about all the things we did in the last<br/>\nfew<br/>\n&gt; days that helped us to learn something new and exciting...I happened to<br/>\npick<br/>\n&gt; up a couple of grade appropriate &#39;curriculum&#39; work books at costco and let<br/>\n&gt; them know that anytime they felt a need to sit down and do &#39;class work&#39;<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; were welcome to...we laughed at that...then they promptly went outside to<br/>\n&gt; play with friends...it is so nice to have the wieght of ps off our<br/>\n&gt; shoulders...and I feel like I am getting some quality time with them...I<br/>\n&gt; always felt that I was competing with ps for thier time...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This letter must be all over the place...I am just excited about<br/>\nunschooling<br/>\n&gt; and having a forum to share our experiences!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lhiza<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 23<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sun, 6 Feb 2000 04:50:21 EST<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JENNIFE30@...\">JENNIFE30@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: We Want Our Children to Be Suckers!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; John,,,,<br/>\n&gt; that was great,,,a wonderful twist on &#39;sucker&#39;, and very true to what a<br/>\n&#39;true<br/>\n&gt; sucker&#39; is--one who puts the emphasis on what can i get out of this<br/>\n&gt; experience, but not in a superficial way,,or in a me thing,,,,but in a<br/>\nvery<br/>\n&gt; deep need to know for the sake of knowing and nothing else kind of way.
