Supposedly I should be able to make a <br/>\nliving by following my interests, too. But what if my passion is <br/>\nwriting well-researched stories about everyday people, something that <br/>\nisn&#39;t very lucrative? To answer my question, I visited Michael Fogler <br/>\nin his Lexington, Kentucky, home. Michael is a homeschooling father <br/>\nand author of the book, Un-jobbing: The Adult Liberation Handbook, <br/>\nwhich asserts that it isn&#39;t necessary to give up an interest in order <br/>\nto make a living without a job. His secret, it seems, is just using <br/>\ncommon sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeter Kowalke: Unschooling is to learn without going to school. Is <br/>\nun-jobbing to earn without having a job? Could you explain what it <br/>\nmeans to &quot;un-job&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Fogler: In a sense, Yes, if we define job as an activity we <br/>\ndo for money which we really wouldn&#39;t be doing if it weren&#39;t for the <br/>\nmoney. That is what I see as so wasteful in our society: millions of <br/>\npeople spending the bulk of their able-bodied lives in activities <br/>\nthat they wouldn&#39;t be doing if they didn&#39;t need the money attached to <br/>\nit. Can we not do only activities which are in alignment with our <br/>\nvalues and sense of purpose, with some of these activities also <br/>\nbringing in income? I say yes. So, I see a life of un-jobbing as a <br/>\nlife in which all of the activities that a person does are activities <br/>\nthat the person really wants to do, whether they are income-producing <br/>\nor not. This person is doing what he/she truly wants to do, period. <br/>\n&quot;Work&quot; and &quot;play&quot; become blurred, virtually one and the same. They <br/>\nblend together into, simply, Life. John Holt once proclaimed that <br/>\nlearning is not the product of teaching (something I have come to <br/>\nagree with). Similarly, living is not the product of &quot;making a <br/>\nliving&quot; (i.e. the job) in our culture. So, my thing is to encourage <br/>\n(conscious) living in every moment and to change &quot;making a living&quot; <br/>\n(which should be more accurately called &quot;making a dying&quot;) into <br/>\n&quot;making a life.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPeter: The recent advertising campaign for the job site, Monster.com, <br/>\npoints out that no one grows up wanting a bad job; we all want to <br/>\nearn money by doing what we love. But even career guides admit that <br/>\nwe can&#39;t always do what we love without some sacrifice. Besides <br/>\nhaving a marketable interest, such as computers, how does one &quot;make a <br/>\nlife&quot; by doing what he or she enjoys?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the interview is here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/175/afogler.html\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/175/afogler.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21257,"nextTopicId":21260}}
