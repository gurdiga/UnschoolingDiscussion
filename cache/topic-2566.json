They deliver<br/>\ntheir &quot;adequate&quot; service  in pre-determined way to pre-determined public<br/>\nclients.  They are not required to deliver their resources or to other<br/>\nclients, in any other ways unless their bosses, the taxpayers, instruct<br/>\nthem to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nNonetheless, it is often good public relations (and good business) for<br/>\nthe public utility to be flexible, to capture markets in new ways, and<br/>\nto be good neighbors.  Our personal experience is that we can often be<br/>\nsuccessful in gaining access to the resources OUR WAY (and even getting<br/>\nthem to create new ones) when we capitalize on what they perceive to be<br/>\nin their own interest.<br/>\nIn other words, treat them with respect and as potential allies.<br/>\n<br/>\nEntitlement, though?  Why?<br/>\n<br/>\ndavid</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2565,"nextTopicId":2574}}
