It was just the stuff I needed to <br/>\nhear after driving a total of an hour and a quarter to drive a little guy <br/>\nhome.  He had planned to spend the night with us and then at about 9:30 <br/>\np.m. or so decided he&#39;d rather go home, which is a half to three quarters <br/>\nof an hour&#39;s drive from our home.  I felt sleepy and in a generally funky <br/>\nmood when I walked back in the door carrying a 50-pound bundle of <br/>\nstill-sweet-smelling sleeping boy.  Did you know that kids gain 20 pounds <br/>\nwhen they&#39;re sleeping?  It&#39;s amazing but true!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks, folks, for being there to cheer me up, even when you didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow I was in need of cheering.
