As I read I<br/>\nhave so many responses, but actually grabbing the time to formulate some<br/>\nkind of coherent email response has been tough lately. So, I&#39;m thinking,<br/>\ndigesting, and wishing I had more time to jump in.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I like threes, maybe that number is just particularly relevant in my<br/>\nlife. I have 3 kids who each look for different things from me when they ask<br/>\nquestions. My youngest would ask me over and over &quot;Why is Buzz sad, mama?&quot;<br/>\nwhen watching Buzz Lightyear, StarCommand, and it took me a few times of<br/>\ntrying to answer him to realize that what he really wanted me to say was,<br/>\n&quot;Why do you think he&#39;s sad?&quot; Once I got the pattern down, things went much<br/>\nmore smoothly! *g* Like Sang&#39;s son, I guess, my guy really wants me to ask<br/>\nhim what he thinks, and he&#39;ll get mad if I break protocol.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also seem to have 3 basic kinds of responses: 1) provide the information<br/>\n2) ask what they think and 3) say let&#39;s go look it up. The situations<br/>\ndictate the kind of response, I think. Matter of fact questions like<br/>\nspelling, where are we going, etc. are just asking for quick, easy<br/>\ninformation. More philosophical questions, for me, seem to require a &quot;what<br/>\ndo you think?&quot; response and usually end up leading to really great<br/>\nconversations that would have been shut down if I had just given my own pat<br/>\nanswer as if it were definitive in some way. Questions I don&#39;t know the<br/>\nanswer to off the top of my head require a curious and upbeat, &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow. Let&#39;s look it up!&quot; They may or may not want to sit with me while we<br/>\nlook it up on the computer or a book; sometimes I&#39;ll just report back to<br/>\nthem or we&#39;ll ask their father when he gets home for science-related things.<br/>\nSometimes it&#39;s a combination of all three: I&#39;ll share what little I know,<br/>\nwe&#39;ll speculate together and then look it up for more info.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I don&#39;t get too hung up over the questions. My kids are perfectly<br/>\ncapable of stopping me if I begin to ramble beyond their curiosity. ;)  Part<br/>\nof this may be because they&#39;ve never been damaged by the school experience<br/>\nof someone shoving unwanted information down their throats. I love that they<br/>\nask questions, and it&#39;s usually their questions that reveal how much they<br/>\nknow--not in a quizzing kind of way, but in a genuine give and take<br/>\nconversation and speculation kind of way. I love hearing the way their minds<br/>\nwork and how they make connections. Information that they probably would not<br/>\nrecall if put on the spot in a test or by someone verbally quizzing them<br/>\njust flows when the conversation and connections are there--that, to me, is<br/>\nreal knowledge, not just some regurgitated, isolated factoid.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77070457,"authorName":"Sanguinegirl83@aol.com","from":"Sanguinegirl83@...","profile":"sanguinegirl83","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Questioning questions","postDate":"1083560277","msgId":93388,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5ZS4yM2EyMjdkOC4yZGM3MmI1NUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":93386,"nextInTopic":93431,"prevInTime":93387,"nextInTime":93389,"topicId":93338,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/2/2004 12:13:59 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

So, if it is a <br/>\nquestion that has a definate short answer, I will just tell him. If <br/>\nit is more of a difficult question, or I don&#39;t know the answer <br/>\nmyself, we go an look it up together.  The only time I answer him <br/>\nwith another question is when the question is more of an opinion, or <br/>\nsubjective, like &quot;is broccoli good?&quot;. Then I would ask him if he <br/>\nthinks broccoli is good, and then tell him what I think. Last night <br/>\nhe had a philosophical thought while we were falling asleep (he is <br/>\npretty much four) and he asked me if we are real. I asked him if he <br/>\nthought we are real.

What if you were a <br/>\nvisitor in a foreign land, and were unsure sometimes about the <br/>\nlanguage, the customs, and didn&#39;t know how things worked. You had a <br/>\ntrusted guide with you. If you asked the guide questions, anything <br/>\nfrom &quot;How do you say &#39;Where&#39;s the bathroom&#39;?&quot; to &quot;How does the <br/>\ntransportation system work here?&quot;, you would probably like your guide <br/>\nto answer them. If your guide redirected them back to you &quot;How do <br/>\n*you* think the system works?&quot;, I would imagine it would be <br/>\nfrustrating for you. You say she often really wants you to answer. <br/>\nI&#39;d let that  be your guide, and assume that if she&#39;s asking, she <br/>\nwants an answer. Kids are a bit like exchange students in a new <br/>\nculture, and they want to know how everything around them works. If <br/>\nmy kids ask me how to spell something, I assume they want to know it <br/>\nand I give them the answer. Often they don&#39;t, and they just invent <br/>\nthe spelling themselves (leading to some wonderful things that I&#39;ve <br/>\nsaved for posterity - a sign on my son&#39;s door that read &quot;Konstwukchen <br/>\nGoen On&quot;, for instance!) but if they ask, I will definitely give them <br/>\nthe answer! I think kid&#39;s have plenty of discovery process finding <br/>\nout everything around them. If they want an answer to a specific <br/>\nquestion, I&#39;d say supply it.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2)  How do others do this?  Do you encourage your kids to <br/>\n&gt; follow through or simply let them be and assume they&#39;ll ask to <br/>\n&gt; follow through when they want to? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Neither? I don&#39;t really &quot;encourage&quot; them to follow through, but if <br/>\nwe&#39;re at the library the next day, or at home in front of the <br/>\ninternet a few hours later, I&#39;ll ask them &quot;Do you want to look up <br/>\nthat info about XXXX?&quot; For instance, my son (7.5) had a bunch of <br/>\nquestions after someone we knew got called up for jury duty. The next <br/>\ntime we were at the library, I mentioned that we could find a book <br/>\nabout it, which he wanted to do. A week or so later, DH and I watched <br/>\nThe Runaway Jury, and I mentioned it to DS the next day that it might <br/>\nbe something he&#39;d like to watch all or part of, as it shows the jury <br/>\nprocess from start to finish. If he wants to follow through (he did <br/>\nin both cases), he just does. If not, he just says &quot;no&quot;, which is <br/>\nfine too. Some questions are more burning than others, of course. <br/>\nIt&#39;s the same for my daughter (4.5) - sometimes we follow up on stuff <br/>\nimmediately, sometimes it&#39;s at a later time when we have more <br/>\ninformation available, sometimes it just isn&#39;t important. It&#39;s really <br/>\nnot that much different than how I treat my friends. A friend of mine <br/>\nis very interested in real estate investing right now. If I saw a <br/>\nquote online, or a book, or a video, or something on that topic, I&#39;d <br/>\nemail it to her or be sure to mention it to her the next time I saw <br/>\nher. That&#39;s just being friendly and remembering my friend&#39;s <br/>\ninterests. She would clip an article or tell me about a movie that <br/>\nshe saw that she thought I was interested in. Heck, my own mom still <br/>\nsends me about 3 clipped articles a month :-)  I think the danger is <br/>\nif you start investing any of the questions with particular <br/>\nimportance in your own mind (as in &quot;Oh, he&#39;s asking about Christopher <br/>\nColumbus, better go check out 12 American History books&quot;) - just go <br/>\nwith the flow of the child&#39;s interests and they&#39;ll let you know when <br/>\nthey&#39;ve had too much info.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Questioning questions","postDate":"1083513410","msgId":93342,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwOTUxQTQyLjkwNjAzQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGM3MnB1NitkNGdsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGM3MnB1NitkNGdsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":93339,"nextInTopic":93343,"prevInTime":93341,"nextInTime":93343,"topicId":93338,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** 1) How do you deal with your kids questions?

One thing it did is <br/>\nreally bring up for me a question I&#39;ve been wrestling with since <br/>\nMorgaine could talk, and I would love to hear how others approach <br/>\nit.  <br/>\n<br/>\n1) How do you deal with your kids&#39; questions?  I dislike answering <br/>\nall her questions (and she asks lots of big ones!) because I often <br/>\nfeel I&#39;m taking her process from her. Whether little questions <br/>\nlike &quot;how do you spell ... &quot; to big questions like &quot;What if <br/>\neverything in the world broke?&quot; I prefer to leave it to her to <br/>\nwrestle with and be a sideline facilitator of conversation, IYKWIM.  <br/>\nHowever, she often really wants me to answer ... either she wants to <br/>\nspell the word correctly or wants to know what I think, and if I try <br/>\nto be more evasive and shoot the q. back in her direction, she <br/>\nsometimes gets angry, even when I tell her it&#39;s one of those <br/>\nquestions nobody has a definite answer to.  Those I&#39;ll answer <br/>\nwith &quot;Well I can tell you what I think/believe, but other people <br/>\nhave different ideas.&quot;  Anyway, I go back and forth between <br/>\nanswering because she asks and not answering because I feel I&#39;m <br/>\ntaking away part of her discovery process. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) Some questions, of course, require outside resources.  Our <br/>\nquestion place is usually the car when I&#39;m driving ... example, <br/>\nyesterday she was asking about claws on bunnies and cats, and that <br/>\nled to the differences including retraction.  She wanted to know <br/>\nwhy.  We discussed looking for a book in the library or writing to a <br/>\nvet.  Like most of these questions that require outside resources, <br/>\nshe hasn&#39;t mentioned it again.  My thoughts are that at this age she <br/>\nmay just enjoy exploring the questioning process, and that knowing <br/>\noutside resources exist may be enough.  I feel that if she really <br/>\nwanted an answer, she&#39;d explore it more once we got home or to the <br/>\nlibrary, etc.  How do others do this?  Do you encourage your kids to <br/>\nfollow through or simply let them be and assume they&#39;ll ask to <br/>\nfollow through when they want to? <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know that it matters but Morgaine&#39;s still very little; 4.5 <br/>\nyrs.  We&#39;re also getting into the same questions with Orion, who&#39;s <br/>\njust turned 2. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any input!<br/>\n<br/>\nKristi <br/>\nmama to Morgaine, 4; Orion, 2; and Isaac, 8 wks</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93428,"nextTopicId":93458}}
