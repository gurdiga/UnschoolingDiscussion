They said <br/>\nthat he did not fit the keyhole for autism and teachers did not know <br/>\nhow to keep him from being bored. He now picks what he wants to learn <br/>\nand is learning every day. It is glorious to see progress instead of <br/>\nso many daily struggles. He finally could not handle the stress of <br/>\nschool and anxiety attacks got the better of him. This is why we <br/>\nstarted to homeschool. With children who have such high IQs to start <br/>\nwith, it is amazing what they can find to learn on their own. Good <br/>\nluck and I am glad you are homeschooling.

Mine <br/>\nhas been battered in school by teachers because he&#39;s a square peg in a round <br/>\nhole. They actually want me to put him on neuroleptic drugs to &quot;calm&quot; him <br/>\ndown. Translation -- in the areas where my son is two or more years ahead of <br/>\ngrade level, they want him to pretend he&#39;s not bored and use drugs to get him <br/>\nto sit still in his seat. He has a full-time aide, mind you, and can easily <br/>\nbe assigned other work at those moments that fits his interest level more.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday he was sneezing a lot just before the school bus came and I just <br/>\ndecided to let him stay home. We ended up going to a small restaurant for <br/>\nlunch near a harbor close to home. On the dock, we watched a sea gull in <br/>\nclear shallow water (and he watched us). Even now and then he would move his <br/>\nwebbed feet very fast and disturb all the silt on the bottom of the water. <br/>\nSometimes a tiny sea creature would float up in the swirl of silt and the sea <br/>\ngull would get rewarded with lunch. It was absolutely fascinating to watch.  <br/>\nMy son and I talked about how the sea gull&#39;s luck meant some other creature <br/>\nwould die. He said, philosophically, &quot;everything dies some time. That&#39;s life.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re home now and he&#39;s just watching cartoons. My son is more relaxed today <br/>\nthan I have seen him in a long time.
