Anyone who","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1226546298\">I enjoyed Aaron Falbel&#39;s article &quot;Beyong GWS: Growing Without Education&quot; on<br/>\npages 28-31 of the Sept/Oct issue of &quot;Growing Without Schooling.&quot;  Anyone<br/>\nwho questions the idea of education, will find this article well worth<br/>\nreading.  I found the magazine at a local library.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn it (page 28), Falbel includes a 1976 quote by John Holt:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Education...now seems to me perhaps the most authoritarian and dangerous of<br/>\nall the social inventions of mankind.  It is the deepest foundation of the<br/>\nmodern slave state, in which most people feel themselves to be nothing but<br/>\nproducers, consumers, spectators, and &#39;fans,&#39; driven more and more, in all<br/>\nparts of their lives, by greed, envy, and fear.  My concern is not to<br/>\nimprove &#39;education&#39; but to do away with it, to end the ugly and antihuman<br/>\nbusiness of people-shaping and to allow and help people to shape<br/>\nthemselves.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe essay is packed with interesting thoughts.  Here is one other I found<br/>\nparticularly good:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Education teaches us that we must adapt ourselves to society as it is, that<br/>\nwe must keep pace with the dictates of &quot;progress,&quot; that life is a race, and<br/>\nthat we need education to get ahead of the next guy or else we&#39;ll be left<br/>\nbehind.&quot;  pg. 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we reject the mindset that life is a race, we loosen the stranglehold<br/>\nwhich education has over us.  Thus freed, we might begin to learn things for<br/>\nmore authentic and natural reasons.  We may then begin to fully enjoy the<br/>\ndelight of discovery, of intellectual stimulation, of the deep and<br/>\never-changing diversity and endless wonder our world.<br/>\n<br/>\n John Andersen<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/joandersen\">http://members.xoom.com/joandersen</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4226,"nextTopicId":4233}}
