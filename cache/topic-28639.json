Just last evening,  my dd had two friends over.  I<br/>\ntold them they neede to leave by XXXX time so that we could get dinner have<br/>\nthe evenings plans work out. (The plans were for dd to attend a program at<br/>\nour local library).  XXX time came,  I said to dd and friends,  it&#39;s xxx<br/>\ntime.....you agreed to go home and dd you will bea ble to do a,b,c and have<br/>\ntime to get to your program.  Then I had to go finish dinner.  I gave them<br/>\none more verbal cue.  Well,  20 minutes later,  thay were finally leaving.<br/>\nDinner was 15 minutes later and dd wasn&#39;t ready to leave on time.  I was<br/>\nable to remain detatched.  After she was through being upset,  we were able<br/>\nto discuss how to make it work next time.<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject: Re: Re: switch, cabbage,  T-giving,etc<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe they need to &quot;hear that actions have consequences....  &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  They can learn this just by experiencing the consequences.  Just by the<br/>\nfact that we lose control they are seeing and experiencing that we are<br/>\nnot perfect and only human.  They are learning from this too.  They<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to be told.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28638,"nextTopicId":28642}}
