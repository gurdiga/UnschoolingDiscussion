I <br/>\nmade an outline of the various subject areas and put it on a <br/>\nclipboard.  Each week I would write in library books read, Cricket <br/>\narticles read, reading alone, writing, math activities, PBS shows, <br/>\nfield trips, physical exercise, musical and other learning <br/>\nexperiences we would have together.  I would enter this weekly onto <br/>\nan outline on our computer and then every six months just print and <br/>\nmail!  It was kind of impressive when it got compiled that way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as grade levels, you could get one of those world book <br/>\noutlines or some other such thing of what kids &quot;need to know&quot; at each <br/>\ngrade level and just check them off.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI only do what is required by the state that I live in... I know what <br/>\nmy kids know and they often know more than me!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37037,"nextTopicId":37061}}
