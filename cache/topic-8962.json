All","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-171740376\">Becky,<br/>\nRuth Beechick&#39;s great little books are a set of 3 small books: A Home Start<br/>\nin Reading, An Easy Start in Arithmetic, and A Strong Start in Language.<br/>\nAll are written for grades K-3, are about 30 pages long and give practical<br/>\nadvice on how to start.  You can find them in just about any homeschool<br/>\ncatalog (www.rainbowresource.com, www.lifetimeonline.com)  The BOB books are<br/>\nsmall paperback books that come in sets of 6-8.  Each book introduces 3-5<br/>\nletters/sounds.  They have cute pictures to go with the &quot;story&quot;.  You can<br/>\nfind them at any bookstore, I think even Target has them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have always read to our children, daily.  I think that gives them a very<br/>\nstrong start, as they love to read.  When Dillon seemed like he was<br/>\nbeginning to try to read I began by introducing sounds of letters (he had<br/>\nknown his ABC&#39;s for a long time).  I actually began with his name,<br/>\nintroduced the D sound & showed him other words with the D sound.  The we<br/>\nused to BOB books which introduce 2-3 new sounds (phonics) with each book.<br/>\nWe went through 2 sets of BOB books, doing 1-3 a day.  Once he got that far<br/>\nhe understood what we were doing as far as decoding, so I began to introduce<br/>\nreal books.....books he had enjoyed me reading to him like Mercer Mayer&#39;s<br/>\nLittle Critter books.  Then we progressed to Henry & Mudge type books and<br/>\nother &quot;reading&quot; chapter books.  Now he reads whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it very important to know when the child is ready not only to begin,<br/>\nbut when the child is ready to move out of the instructional mode into<br/>\nactual reading.  That leaves the pleasure in reading rather than making it a<br/>\nlesson.  We did not cover every letter sound before beginning to read, to<br/>\nhave done that would have spoiled the excitement of learning to read.  We<br/>\ndid have a time daily when Dillon would read to me, so I could help with the<br/>\ndecoding and letters sounds we had not &quot;done&quot; yet....also it let me see how<br/>\nhe was progressing.  He rarely reads to me now but reads to his little<br/>\nsister a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as phonics vs whole language or site reading, that depends on the<br/>\nchild.  Some pick it up easily with just phonics, others will be later<br/>\nreaders using site words.  Other use a combination hence whole language.<br/>\nYou just have to try one & see how the child does to know which will suit<br/>\nher.<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8943,"nextTopicId":8963}}
