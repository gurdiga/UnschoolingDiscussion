My son came along - he was just learning to stand up at the time,<br/>\n  and we had been doing &quot;baby signs&quot; at home - and he was very welcome. There<br/>\n  were three or four teens in the class, and the others were adults.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sign language is the sort of thing that, since it is so new to most of us<br/>\n  and since it relies much less on traditional academic skills than other<br/>\n  courses, can sometimes level the playing field for kids who are not<br/>\n  necessarily at &quot;college level&quot; in other areas. Some of the kids were a lot<br/>\n  faster at picking things up than some of us adults were.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t know what policies colleges might have about these courses - maybe<br/>\n  it would be easier to access them if they&#39;re non-credit, &quot;adult education&quot;<br/>\n  or &quot;community&quot; courses held at the college.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One warning about sign, though - there seem to be a lot of colleges and<br/>\n  other institutions hiring non-native signers to teach these courses. That&#39;s<br/>\n  not necessarily bad, but it might be. Unless the person is Deaf or very<br/>\n  involved in the Deaf community (child of a Deaf adult, very experienced<br/>\n  interpreter, etc.), what you might get is a teacher who has basically<br/>\n  memorized a bunch of signs and has no idea how to string them together. That<br/>\n  &#39;s like memorizing the dictionary for a spoken language, never having heard<br/>\n  it and having not a clue as to sentence structure. So ask a lot of questions<br/>\n  about the teacher before you sign up.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Another thing to consider is whether the child in question is likely to be<br/>\n  &quot;good at&quot; sign. Some people are more visually oriented and have better<br/>\n  coordination. I have trouble with both of these areas, but since I&#39;ve<br/>\n  already had a lot of experience in various &quot;educational&quot; settings, and am<br/>\n  aware of the hidden classroom dynamics (initially through John Holt&#39;s<br/>\n  books), I didn&#39;t let the fact that I was kind of slow to catch on bother me<br/>\n  too much. It&#39;s pretty evident when you&#39;re making mistakes in sign (as<br/>\n  opposed to in some written exercise), so you wouldn&#39;t want a kid to feel so<br/>\n  much on the spot that he or she missed having any fun and decided that all<br/>\n  classroom learning is by definition horrible.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Elsa Haas<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Sarah Carothers [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 5:21 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:new subject!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do any of you have experience with your older children attending local<br/>\n  community colleges?

My son came along  he was just learning to stand up at the time,<br/>\nand we had been doing baby signs at home  and he was very welcome. There<br/>\nwere three or four teens in the class, and the others were adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nSign language is the sort of thing that, since it is so new to most of us<br/>\nand since it relies much less on traditional academic skills than other<br/>\ncourses, can sometimes level the playing field for kids who are not<br/>\nnecessarily at college level in other areas. Some of the kids were a lot<br/>\nfaster at picking things up than some of us adults were.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont know what policies colleges might have about these courses  maybe<br/>\nit would be easier to access them if theyre non-credit, adult education<br/>\nor community courses held at the college.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne warning about sign, though  there seem to be a lot of colleges and<br/>\nother institutions hiring non-native signers to teach these courses. Thats<br/>\nnot necessarily bad, but it might be. Unless the person is Deaf or very<br/>\ninvolved in the Deaf community (child of a Deaf adult, very experienced<br/>\ninterpreter, etc.), what you might get is a teacher who has basically<br/>\nmemorized a bunch of signs and has no idea how to string them together. That<br/>\ns like memorizing the dictionary for a spoken language, never having heard<br/>\nit and having not a clue as to sentence structure. So ask a lot of questions<br/>\nabout the teacher before you sign up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing to consider is whether the child in question is likely to be<br/>\ngood at sign. Some people are more visually oriented and have better<br/>\ncoordination. I have trouble with both of these areas, but since Ive<br/>\nalready had a lot of experience in various educational settings, and am<br/>\naware of the hidden classroom dynamics (initially through John Holts<br/>\nbooks), I didnt let the fact that I was kind of slow to catch on bother me<br/>\ntoo much. Its pretty evident when youre making mistakes in sign (as<br/>\nopposed to in some written exercise), so you wouldnt want a kid to feel so<br/>\nmuch on the spot that he or she missed having any fun and decided that all<br/>\nclassroom learning is by definition horrible.<br/>\n<br/>\nElsa Haas<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sarah Carothers [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, November 26, 2001 5:21 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:new subject!<br/>\n<br/>\nDo any of you have experience with your older children attending local<br/>\ncommunity colleges?
