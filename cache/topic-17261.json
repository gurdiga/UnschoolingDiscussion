Does anyone LIMIT things like computers, sci-fi<br/>\n&gt; books, videos? We don&#39;t have TV at all, never have, so<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s not a problem. But what about other stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The questions I usually ask myself in these sorts of situations are - is<br/>\nwhat my child is doing life-threatening, health-threatening, likely to hurt<br/>\nthemself or others, or morally dangerous?? If not, I try really hard not to<br/>\nmess with it. So  in answer to your question, yes I do think that at some<br/>\npoint we might limit things, if I found they met the above criteria. So in<br/>\nother words, we might limit computer time if my kid spent so much time in<br/>\nfront of the computer that they became a pale and flabby worm (health<br/>\nthreatening), or if they were conversing on the internet with potential<br/>\nchild molesters or some such outrageous thing that was dangerous (hard to<br/>\nimagine, but still...). Or if they were reading books or magazines that we<br/>\nfelt were detrimental to their burgeoning psyches, sure we&#39;d limit it. I<br/>\nthink every parent has limits, whether they like to admit it or not, and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t necessarily think some limits are a bad thing. We all draw lines in<br/>\nthe sand, the difference being where those lines are drawn. Personally, I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s a good idea to draw your lines where they matter the most, and<br/>\nwhere you can give maximum freedom to your kids to enjoy the experiences in<br/>\nlife that they are drawn to. I don&#39;t believe that unschooling means<br/>\nfree-for-all, to me it means that I follow my childrens&#39; lead and try to<br/>\ngently guide them where I see them reaching boundaries that I think are<br/>\nimportant. For instance, for us that meant getting rid of the TV this last<br/>\nyear. It was obviously negatively impacting our lives on a daily basis, so<br/>\nit went down to the basement and has not really been missed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that you&#39;re taking an important step in challenging your own<br/>\nassumptions about what is &quot;worthwhile&quot; and what is a &quot;waste of time&quot;. In<br/>\nunschooling our children, we sometimes have to put in a lot of work<br/>\ndeschooling ourselves. After all, most of us grow up with the assumptions<br/>\nthat our culture and schooling have indoctrinated us with. Things have to be<br/>\n&quot;educational&quot; or &quot;useful&quot; (as defined by someone else&#39;s arbitrary standards)<br/>\nin order to have value. Letting go of these assumptions can be really<br/>\ndifficult. For me, I&#39;ve found that always keeping a mind-opening book handy<br/>\nfor reading and inspiration helps to keep my own horizons ever expanding<br/>\n(anything by John Holt, John Taylor Gatto, Grace Llewellyn, among others are<br/>\ngood places to start).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would bet Bill Gates doesn&#39;t feel that he blew off too much time by<br/>\nplaying on computers, that Matisse is glad he &quot;wasted&quot; time cutting up bits<br/>\nof paper and pasting them into collages, that Edison trifled away his hours<br/>\ntinkering with things most people saw no use for, that Asimov spent his<br/>\nwriting hours in the realm of &quot;trashy&quot; Sci Fi, etc. etc. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n Blue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;I told you I was going to grow up to be a<br/>\nweirdo&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) Who says &quot;Fishy swim!&quot; at the aquarium, her favorite place<br/>\nin the world<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Johanna","from":"&quot;Johanna&quot; &lt;saninocencio1@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ZwEbCwxkptAHmAcJvmYH2VZNNyLVeH0PFW_iZjeJWJ_5Dt_4nV6JE1Rd77bI0VxwTuyAe97w6nFo8CEVVQXOjAQofSUgi4o9ZqlR-g","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] new to this list: Hi!","postDate":"985758895","msgId":17297,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwODMwMWMwYjc0YiQ5ZTUyNTU0MCRhNGVjYWRjZkBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDNBQzBGQUVGLjEwNTQuNjQxOTIyRkBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+"},"prevInTopic":17295,"nextInTopic":17298,"prevInTime":17296,"nextInTime":17298,"topicId":17261,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Somebody else remembers Anne McCaffrey!!

Our \n  job is to train up our children<br>&gt; in the way that they should go..even \n  in the small things. The bible is<br>&gt; very clear on this.

My \n  daughter is indeed obsessive about the<br>&gt; television. I am the same way \n  about the computer. We made a deal to<br>&gt; limit our television and \n  computer times down to an hour each day with<br>&gt; allowances for special \n  times or special programs. You can sit down<br>&gt; with the kids and make an \n  agreement that they can do maybe an hour on<br>&gt; pharoah and maybe half an \n  hour on smileys or whatever that one is. Do<br>&gt; the same thing with the \n  books. Say he can read his Star Wars book for<br>&gt; a couple hours if he \n  also reads a nature book, or some other book for<br>&gt; twice the amount of \n  time he reads the star wars books. You can also<br>&gt; have him build models \n  of the ships, write his own sci-fi play, etc<br>&gt; instead of just reading \n  alone. I am having the same problem with the<br>&gt; Harry Potter books. She \n  can read it, provided she also reads some<br>&gt; other books from the library \n  as well.

We&#39;ve been \n      homeschooling for a year and a<br>half, since I took them out of public \n      school. We<br>decided a couple weeks ago to try unschooling, \n      after<br>reading a lot about it. I have a couple questions:<br><br>1. I&#39;m \n      wondering if anyone limits computer time? My<br>kids love the computer, \n      and are on it all the time. I<br>feel ok when I see them playing Pharoah \n      (a game about<br>ancient Egypt) but they&#39;re also spending a lot of \n      time<br>playing Smiloid, a silly game of splashing smiley<br>faces with \n      paint. Now, I tell myself it&#39;s ok, they&#39;re<br>playing that together, it \n      requires cooperation, etc.<br>But part of me feels like it&#39;s wasting time. \n      I *know*<br>that unschooling is about everything being \n      learning,<br>nothing is a waste of time. But the kids are on \n      the<br>computer for hours a day. So I wonder if anyone else<br>has \n      encountered this situation.<br><br>2. My son is a very advanced reader, \n      but since our<br>unschooling started, all he reads is Star Wars \n      books.<br>They&#39;re adult sci-fi, and I worry a little about there<br>being \n      &quot;scary&quot; stuff in there, though he&#39;s VERY<br>sensitive and would stop \n      reading if he did get<br>scared.Also, I have this bias that sci-fi is \n      trash. :)<br>I have no intention of censoring his reading, because<br>I \n      believe it&#39;s for him to find what he&#39;s comfortable<br>with. <br><br>I \n      guess my 2 questions are the same: I understand<br>we&#39;re guides and are to \n      put interesting things in<br>their path, but what about taking things out \n      of their<br>paths? Does anyone LIMIT things like computers, \n      sci-fi<br>books, videos? We don&#39;t have TV at all, never have, so<br>that&#39;s \n      not a problem. But what about other stuff?<br><br>Hmm, even writing this I \n      feel like I have my answer.<br>I&#39;m being a control freak. \n      :)<br><br>Juli<br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do \n      You Yahoo!?<br>Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!

I, \nas an adult have been known to play solitare or other games when the task I am \nworking on gets frustrating. After a while I can go back to the task and often \nsee things differently. If you feel they are really in front of the computer too \nmuch, suggest someting else that might interest them. Sometimes we need \nideas&nbsp;too. As for the science fiction, go easy on him. He is reading and \nthat&nbsp;will only improve his reading ability. Science fiction books can also \nhave deep thought built in.

My name&#39;s Juli and I&#39;m homeschooling my ds, \n  10<br>and dd, 8. We&#39;ve been homeschooling for a year and a<br>half, since I \n  took them out of public school. We<br>decided a couple weeks ago to try \n  unschooling, after<br>reading a lot about it. I have a couple \n  questions:<br><br>1. I&#39;m wondering if anyone limits computer time? My<br>kids \n  love the computer, and are on it all the time. I<br>feel ok when I see them \n  playing Pharoah (a game about<br>ancient Egypt) but they&#39;re also spending a \n  lot of time<br>playing Smiloid, a silly game of splashing smiley<br>faces with \n  paint. Now, I tell myself it&#39;s ok, they&#39;re<br>playing that together, it \n  requires cooperation, etc.<br>But part of me feels like it&#39;s wasting time. I \n  *know*<br>that unschooling is about everything being learning,<br>nothing is a \n  waste of time. But the kids are on the<br>computer for hours a day. So I \n  wonder if anyone else<br>has encountered this situation.<br><br>2. My son is a \n  very advanced reader, but since our<br>unschooling started, all he reads is \n  Star Wars books.<br>They&#39;re adult sci-fi, and I worry a little about \n  there<br>being &quot;scary&quot; stuff in there, though he&#39;s VERY<br>sensitive and would \n  stop reading if he did get<br>scared.Also, I have this bias that sci-fi is \n  trash. :)<br>I have no intention of censoring his reading, because<br>I \n  believe it&#39;s for him to find what he&#39;s comfortable<br>with. <br><br>I guess my \n  2 questions are the same: I understand<br>we&#39;re guides and are to put \n  interesting things in<br>their path, but what about taking things out of \n  their<br>paths? Does anyone LIMIT things like computers, sci-fi<br>books, \n  videos? We don&#39;t have TV at all, never have, so<br>that&#39;s not a problem. But \n  what about other stuff?<br><br>Hmm, even writing this I feel like I have my \n  answer.<br>I&#39;m being a control freak. \n  :)<br><br>Juli<br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do \n  You Yahoo!?<br>Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!

Our \n    job is to train up our children<br>&gt; in the way that they should go..even \n    in the small things. The bible is<br>&gt; very clear on this. I don&#39;t know \n    if you are a christian family or not,<br>&gt; but in either case your \n    concerns are valid because they are born of<br>&gt; your love for your \n    children. My daughter is indeed obsessive about the<br>&gt; television. I am \n    the same way about the computer. We made a deal to<br>&gt; limit our \n    television and computer times down to an hour each day with<br>&gt; \n    allowances for special times or special programs. You can sit down<br>&gt; \n    with the kids and make an agreement that they can do maybe an hour \n    on<br>&gt; pharoah and maybe half an hour on smileys or whatever that one \n    is. Do<br>&gt; the same thing with the books. Say he can read his Star Wars \n    book for<br>&gt; a couple hours if he also reads a nature book, or some \n    other book for<br>&gt; twice the amount of time he reads the star wars \n    books. You can also<br>&gt; have him build models of the ships, write his \n    own sci-fi play, etc<br>&gt; instead of just reading alone. I am having the \n    same problem with the<br>&gt; Harry Potter books. She can read it, provided \n    she also reads some<br>&gt; other books from the library as well. WE also \n    add bible reading and<br>&gt; prayer time to our day.

I&#39;m wondering if anyone limits computer time? My<br/>\n&gt; kids love the computer, and are on it all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t limit them here.    We are a housefull of geeks and wannabe geeks<br/>\nthough. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; feel ok when I see them playing Pharoah (a game about<br/>\n&gt; ancient Egypt) but they&#39;re also spending a lot of time<br/>\n&gt; playing Smiloid, a silly game of splashing smiley<br/>\n&gt; faces with paint. Now, I tell myself it&#39;s ok, they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; playing that together, it requires cooperation, etc.<br/>\n&gt; But part of me feels like it&#39;s wasting time. I *know*<br/>\n&gt; that unschooling is about everything being learning,<br/>\n&gt; nothing is a waste of time. But the kids are on the<br/>\n&gt; computer for hours a day. So I wonder if anyone else<br/>\n&gt; has encountered this situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As one who has her computer on from the time I wake up until the time I go<br/>\nto bed, maybe I&#39;m not the one to ask.  :)  But we seem to go through spurts<br/>\nhere. Play a great deal, than outside beckons. We went through a board and<br/>\ncard game phase during the winter.  I became very tired of playing Payday<br/>\nand Risk  Chess and Risk are still the games they play with Dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre they refusing to go outside? Are the games interferring with any other<br/>\npart of their lives?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. My son is a very advanced reader, but since our<br/>\n&gt; unschooling started, all he reads is Star Wars books.<br/>\n&gt; They&#39;re adult sci-fi, and I worry a little about there<br/>\n&gt; being &quot;scary&quot; stuff in there, though he&#39;s VERY<br/>\n&gt; sensitive and would stop reading if he did get<br/>\n&gt; scared.Also, I have this bias that sci-fi is trash. :)<br/>\n&gt; I have no intention of censoring his reading, because<br/>\n&gt; I believe it&#39;s for him to find what he&#39;s comfortable<br/>\n&gt; with.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why do you consider Sci-Fi trash?  Can you pinpoint why you came to believe<br/>\nthis?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not understanding the worry over the scary parts, if you know he would<br/>\nstop as soon as something began to bother him?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess my 2 questions are the same: I understand<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re guides and are to put interesting things in<br/>\n&gt; their path, but what about taking things out of their<br/>\n&gt; paths?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmmm....There are things that I have not brought to their attention at<br/>\ncertain times.  I don&#39;t feel the need to discuss certain topics with my<br/>\nyoung ones yet. So, I guess I do agree that by the nature of parenthood I<br/>\nkeep some issues out of their path until later, or they find them on their<br/>\nown.  If my child was spending 13 hours a day on the computer, or 13 hours a<br/>\nday reading or 13 hours a day doing just any one thing I would feel the<br/>\ndesire to broaden their horizons.  I&#39;m not sure I would feel the same if<br/>\nthey were doing 13 hours of housework/yard work every day, but since that<br/>\nisn&#39;t likely to happen I don&#39;t worry about that one either.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone LIMIT things like computers, sci-fi<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; books, videos?

Limits and control are not dirty words, but parents have to be very<br/>\ncareful and completely aware of why they are doing what they are doing.<br/>\nMoving into the freak area is not good. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisaKK</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Vicki A.

I don&#39;t know if you are a christian family or not, but in \neither case your concerns are valid because they are born of your love for your \nchildren. My daughter is indeed obsessive about the television. I am the same \nway about the computer. We made a deal to limit our television and computer \ntimes down to an hour each day with allowances for special times or special \nprograms. You can sit down with the kids and make an agreement that they can do \nmaybe an hour on pharoah and maybe half an hour on smileys or whatever that one \nis. Do the same thing with the books. Say he can read his Star Wars book for a \ncouple hours if he also reads a nature book, or some other book for twice the \namount of time he reads the star wars books. You can also have him build models \nof the ships, write his own sci-fi play, etc instead of just reading alone. I am \nhaving the same problem with the Harry Potter books. She can read it, provided \nshe also reads some other books from the library as well. WE also add bible \nreading and prayer time to our day.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Pooh\">Jessica</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Vaughnde Lee<br>Missoula, Montana<br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stampinbookworm.eboard.com\">http://www.stampinbookworm.eboard.com</a><br></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;\">\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>-----Original Message-----</b><br><b>From: \n  </b>yuli womie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yuliwomie@...\">yuliwomie@...</a>&gt;<br><b>To: </b><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> \n  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br><b>Date: \n  </b>Tuesday, March 27, 2001 9:08 AM<br><b>Subject: </b>[Unschooling-dotcom] \n  new to this list: Hi!<br><br></font></div><tt>Hello!

My \n    name&#39;s Juli and I&#39;m homeschooling my ds, 10<br>and dd, 8. We&#39;ve been \n    homeschooling for a year and a<br>half, since I took them out of public \n    school. We<br>decided a couple weeks ago to try unschooling, \n    after<br>reading a lot about it. I have a couple questions:<br><br>1. I&#39;m \n    wondering if anyone limits computer time? My<br>kids love the computer, and \n    are on it all the time. I<br>feel ok when I see them playing Pharoah (a game \n    about<br>ancient Egypt) but they&#39;re also spending a lot of time<br>playing \n    Smiloid, a silly game of splashing smiley<br>faces with paint. Now, I tell \n    myself it&#39;s ok, they&#39;re<br>playing that together, it requires cooperation, \n    etc.<br>But part of me feels like it&#39;s wasting time. I *know*<br>that \n    unschooling is about everything being learning,<br>nothing is a waste of \n    time. But the kids are on the<br>computer for hours a day. So I wonder if \n    anyone else<br>has encountered this situation.<br><br>2. My son is a very \n    advanced reader, but since our<br>unschooling started, all he reads is Star \n    Wars books.<br>They&#39;re adult sci-fi, and I worry a little about \n    there<br>being &quot;scary&quot; stuff in there, though he&#39;s VERY<br>sensitive and \n    would stop reading if he did get<br>scared.Also, I have this bias that \n    sci-fi is trash. :)<br>I have no intention of censoring his reading, \n    because<br>I believe it&#39;s for him to find what he&#39;s comfortable<br>with. \n    <br><br>I guess my 2 questions are the same: I understand<br>we&#39;re guides \n    and are to put interesting things in<br>their path, but what about taking \n    things out of their<br>paths? Does anyone LIMIT things like computers, \n    sci-fi<br>books, videos? We don&#39;t have TV at all, never have, so<br>that&#39;s \n    not a problem. But what about other stuff?<br><br>Hmm, even writing this I \n    feel like I have my answer.<br>I&#39;m being a control freak. \n    :)<br><br>Juli<br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do \n    You Yahoo!?<br>Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!
