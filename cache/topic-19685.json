We are pretty far from you, Florida.  In our state we <br/>\n&gt;   don&#39;t have to tell the authorities about our program.  We keep a <br/>\nlog <br/>\n&gt;   of &quot;educational activities&quot; and &quot;sample of student produced <br/>\n&gt;   materials.&quot;  Everything they do falls into the &quot;educational <br/>\n&gt;   activities&quot; and anything on paper that I can fit into a notebook, <br/>\nis a <br/>\n&gt;   &quot;sample.&quot;  Once a year we get a certified teacher (my cousin) to <br/>\n&gt;   evaluate this portfolio and submit the evaluation to the county.  <br/>\nI <br/>\n&gt;   write our evaluation, which, since the state law says the teacher <br/>\nmust <br/>\n&gt;   review this portfolio to determine if the student has progressed, <br/>\nwe <br/>\n&gt;   only include that the teacher has reviewed the portfolio and feels <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt;   student has progressed.  That&#39;s all.  Some parents opt to have <br/>\ntheir <br/>\n&gt;   children take standardized tests and submit the results in stead <br/>\nof <br/>\n&gt;   the eval.  Luckily our state law is not too strict and seems to <br/>\nleave <br/>\n&gt;   a lot of room for people to do what they want but some county <br/>\n&gt;   officials can make it a <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; hassle, if they want.  Some states are more free than this and <br/>\nsome <br/>\n&gt;   are worse.

My question is, did anyone tell <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt;   &#39;authorities&#39; that you were unschooling?  Or did you make up a  <br/>\n&gt;   curriculum?

The laws here seem to be okay, but since I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever dealt with them personally, I&#39;m afraid the reality may be quite <br/>\ndifferent from what it appears to be on paper.  (Well, on computer <br/>\nscreen.)  I have to go through subject by subject and say what topics <br/>\nI plan to cover and how much time per day will be devoted to a <br/>\nparticular area.  Sometimes I just wish I could be responsible for my <br/>\nown child, no questions asked.  But I guess they are worried about <br/>\nneglect.  What did I see somewhere?  The dept. of health doesn&#39;t knock <br/>\non your door to see if you are feeding your children correctly!  Oh <br/>\nwell... sometimes I just have a bit of a hard time being the <br/>\nnon-mainstream person I am turning out to be!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nLove, Tori<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;ambersand&quot; &lt;ambersand@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi Tori.

My question is, did anyone tell the <br/>\n &#39;authorities&#39; that you were unschooling?  Or did you make up a  <br/>\ncurriculum?  What if you didn&#39;t happen to do the things you said...  <br/>\ndid you run into problems getting an exemption the following year? Am <br/>\n I asking too many questions?
