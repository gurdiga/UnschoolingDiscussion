This can be a great thing for kids who are<br/>\nold enough to go play without mom but too young to stay home alone.  Parents<br/>\nbenefit because it is free and your child is being cared for by another<br/>\nparent.  Children benefit because they basically are going on play dates.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a point system.  Then a member introduced cards made on her computer.<br/>\nEach card was worth either 30 minutes or one hour for one child.  Parents<br/>\n&quot;pay&quot; with the cards, which are just getting traded back and forth between<br/>\nthe members.  Most moms kept the cards in their car glovebox, so they would<br/>\nalways be handy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a while, several of us stopped bothering with the points all together<br/>\nas friendships developed.  It was a great way to get started though.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96819,"nextTopicId":97022}}
