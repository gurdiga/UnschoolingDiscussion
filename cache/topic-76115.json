Gillen and I recently read _Farmer Boy_ so it was fun to see the work you had done on it.  From reading a few responses to others (not to mention your incredibly inspiring help here) I can see what a good teacher and writer you are.  I have a few homeschooling friends who don&#39;t unschool (heck, I don&#39;t know anyone in person who unschools) that may be intersted in your program.  I&#39;ll pass along the info.  I don&#39;t think that they would force their kids to do it if they weren&#39;t into it either.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMadeline<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
