School wouldn&#39;t have helped.  There is <br/>\nno &quot;schooling&quot; (in the school-at-home way) for that.   There&#39;s only talking <br/>\nwith him, advising him on how to get along better in particular situations, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s so far as something like Aspergers syndrome you could find websites <br/>\nor discussion lists of families involved with that and see if they have good, <br/>\nuseful tools.  If it&#39;s not that serious, helping him gain tools he can use in <br/>\nsocial situations is something people on this list could help with.  Even kids <br/>\nwith social facility need help and suggestions when situations get tricky.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve advised Kirby to tone down his social ease sometimes to give others a <br/>\nchance to shine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-letting him develop at his own pace-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is that bad advice?<br/>\nCan anyone make someone develop at another pace?<br/>\nThey can try, but it often results in shut-down or side damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-What do you do when he&#39;s nearly a teenager, still struggling with these<br/>\nthings, and embarrassed when he&#39;s with friends and you can&#39;t help him?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are our options?

My son is really excited about going<br/>\nto Camp Invention, but worried about the small amount of writing required<br/>\nduring the projects.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Holly was in a summer dance program, I told the teacher she couldn&#39;t <br/>\nread so please not to ask her to read aloud in front of other kids.  I asked her <br/>\nto tell us what book they were going to use (they were making a stage <br/>\npresentation of a book) so we could get a copy and Holly could learn it.  We did that. <br/>\n When the presentation came at the end of the week, Holly knew all the parts <br/>\nand some kids didn&#39;t even know their own four-line verse.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could tell the counsellors he&#39;s having a hard time with writing and ask <br/>\nthem to help him, not to embarrass him.   <br/>\n<br/>\nKirby stalled off taking driver&#39;s ed for a few months in part because he was <br/>\nafraid he wouldn&#39;t be able to take notes well enough.  He got a 98 in the <br/>\nclass when he finally took it.  Those who COULD write fast had no idea what was <br/>\nimportant to write down, or writing it down didn&#39;t help them, or they just <br/>\ndidn&#39;t bother or something.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-My son&#39;s sibling know this, I just can&#39;t seem to get the message across to<br/>\nthe rest of the world!

School will always take kids.  I&#39;m not recommending it.  <br/>\nI&#39;m trying to poke to see what you want in the way of feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-  He&#39;s on his own track.

I have never had them <br/>\nassessed, as I don&#39;t like assessment unless there is something that can <br/>\nbe done (e.g.. is this arm broken or dislocated).  My #3 son definitely <br/>\nhad visual problems (e.g.. couldn&#39;t put his finger on a red word written <br/>\non white paper), and other signs that some degree of &#39;dyslexia&#39; was <br/>\ninvolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the summer when he was 12 1/2yo he learned to read. I don&#39;t know <br/>\nexactly when, haven&#39;t a clue how, but his main reading was National <br/>\nGeographic.  This is significant for two reasons.  First, I had always <br/>\nassumed he would read fiction like the rest of us. He doesn&#39;t. He is 17 <br/>\nnow and has never read a whole fiction book. Secondly, Lots of bits in <br/>\nNat. Geo. are written over coloured pictures.  As he began to use the <br/>\ncomputer more, he would show me things he had written in Word. I would <br/>\nhave to change the colours before I could read - he used colour schemes <br/>\nlike navy blue writing on dark brown background.  His spelling was <br/>\nawful. It wasn&#39;t even phonetic, it was pretty damn random, and where <br/>\nwords were recognisable they were full of reversals etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, he&#39;s 17 now, and can read anything HE wants to.  He can write <br/>\nin black and white. His spelling has improved hugely - largely through <br/>\nchatting on-line using MSM and message boards.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is a socially oriented kid.  He&#39;s articulate and funny and nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has nearly finished (just 4 weeks to go) a computer course about 2 <br/>\nyears &#39;ahead&#39; of where he would be if he was in school - and helped the <br/>\ntutor with some of the teaching in areas the tutor wasn&#39;t confident in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is a great artist.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe has never been overly physically confident, and was too scared to go <br/>\non a ferris wheel when he was 14 - but in January of this year bungy <br/>\njumped off The Ledge in Queenstown.  (if you don&#39;t know what bungy <br/>\njumping is, check out <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ajhackett.com\">http://www.ajhackett.com</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s 17.  In many ways he&#39;s not the same person as he was when he was <br/>\n12, but looking back I can see that, in fact, it was all there waiting <br/>\nto develop.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s been driving me crazy lately - the combination of a sleep-deprived, <br/>\nhot-flushing menopausal country living mother and a 17yo socially active <br/>\nteenage boy is not always easy.  Thank you for reminding me what a great <br/>\nkid he is - and how wonderfully he has grown since he was a quiet <br/>\nnon-reading, non-writing, physically nervous12yo kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nBreathe and remember, &#39;older&#39; is just a point of view.  I have 4 boys <br/>\naged 23, 20, 17 and 14.  Twelve is just a babe to me!  And I can assure <br/>\nyou that there is a lot of growing, developing, and learning done while <br/>\nliving between 12 and 23 - and beyond.<br/>\n<br/>\nCally</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":42924764,"authorName":"Marjorie Kirk","from":"&quot;Marjorie Kirk&quot; &lt;mkirk@...&gt;","profile":"mdlfkirk","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] dyslexic?","postDate":"1085276024","msgId":94487,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNTIzMDEzMy5pNE4xWHNVTDAxMDczN0Btcy1zbXRwLTAxLWVyaTAub2hpb3JkYy5yci5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwNTIzMDExMS5pNE4xQkxVTDAxNTAxNUBtcy1zbXRwLTAxLWVyaTAub2hpb3JkYy5yci5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":94486,"nextInTopic":94495,"prevInTime":94486,"nextInTime":94488,"topicId":94485,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry to send that post twice.
