Some of it&#39;s justified. Most of it&#39;s not. And having taught <br/>\nthere for almost 20 years, I&#39;m certainly aware of its strengths and <br/>\nweaknesses. <br/>\n   <br/>\n     <br/>\nBut when it comes to a well-rounded education that prepares students for the <br/>\nworld of work and for functioning in a global society, the public school <br/>\nsystem can&#39;t be beat. They take everyone. Blind, deaf, learning disabled, <br/>\nmentally impaired or non-English speaking, public schools take them all and <br/>\nprovide the services they need. And in my experience, that&#39;s exactly what <br/>\nsome parents don&#39;t like about the public school system. <br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I believe that parents should have choices when it comes to educating <br/>\ntheir children. Charter schools and parochial schools are great options. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe educational choice that confounds me, though, is home schooling. Why <br/>\nwould parents choose to isolate their children from a rich and varied <br/>\nlearning environment? Why would parents choose to pull their children out of <br/>\nthe real world and shelter them from the very society that they will <br/>\nultimately have to live and work in? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s perplexing. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn extenuating circumstances home schooling is the only viable alternative, <br/>\nsuch as in the case of a long-term illness. I&#39;m not talking about those <br/>\nsituations. But many times in my career I observed parents choosing to home <br/>\nschool to keep their child away from a certain &quot;element&quot; in the public school <br/>\n<br/>\nsystem that they deemed to be unsavory, to isolate their kids in what seemed <br/>\nto me to be an unhealthy way. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool is more than just academics, and parents do kids a disservice when <br/>\nthey try to protect their kids from the real world. Wouldn&#39;t it be more <br/>\nlogical to teach them to function effectively in it? <br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, the most compelling reason for sending a child to a public school is <br/>\nbecause the public school environment reflects the real world: competition, <br/>\nteamwork, cooperation and simply interacting with a wide variety of people <br/>\nare part of the experience, as they are in society. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe social setting in a school is ripe with learning experiences. People from <br/>\n<br/>\nall walks of life go to public schools: rich, poor, smart, dumb, bullies, <br/>\nsissies, all cultures and ethnicities. And guess what? When kids grow up they <br/>\n<br/>\nare going to have to work with people from all walks of life: rich, poor, <br/>\nsmart, dumb, bullies, sissies, and all cultures and ethnicities. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven with the help of home schooling organizations, home-schooled children <br/>\nare often shortchanged. The worst public school has more to offer in the way <br/>\nof resources than most parents can offer at home, such as science labs, <br/>\ntechnology, foreign language, theater, large and varied curriculums, <br/>\ntextbooks, a variety of multi-media lesson support, clubs and sports. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe teaching staff in a public school can be colorful, too. A variety of <br/>\nteaching and evaluation styles forces a student to grow as a learner. <br/>\nTeachers are even trained to teach to multiple intelligences. How many <br/>\nparents can say the same? <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I have a teaching certificate, I know that I couldn&#39;t come close to <br/>\ngiving my children the education they could get in a public school. I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t possibly offer the depth and breadth of education that I know my <br/>\ncolleagues offer every day. <br/>\n<br/>\nSure, I could go to the home-schooling store and buy a book on say, history, <br/>\nand I could read the chapters and assign the accompanying assignments. I <br/>\ncould check the answers using the answer key. We could even take a trip to <br/>\nGreenfield Village. But could I offer the same depth of understanding as <br/>\nsomeone who chose to teach history because of a passion for it, someone who <br/>\nis an expert in the field? <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course not. I would be a weak substitute, and I know it. <br/>\n<br/>\nParents who home-school their children have their reasons, of course. But the <br/>\n<br/>\neffects of what these students are missing remain to be seen. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, a public education is the best deal around. It&#39;s a great training <br/>\n<br/>\nground for the real world and, even better, it&#39;s free. <br/>\n<br/>\n*** <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Flint Journal<br/>\n200 East First Street<br/>\nFlint, Michigan 48502-1925<br/>\n<br/>\nphone 810.766.6100<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to Submit Letters to the Editor <br/>\n<br/>\nLetters to the editor should include your full name, address and phone <br/>\nnumber. <br/>\nShorter is better.  If you&#39;re referring to a story or another letter, please <br/>\ninclude the headline and date of publication.<br/>\n<br/>\nE-mail your letters to the editor to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:letters@...\">letters@...</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":83049874,"authorName":"Backstrom kelli","from":"Backstrom kelli &lt;kellibac@...&gt;","profile":"kellibac","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"article about homeschooling","postDate":"1051324667","msgId":65841,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwNDI2MDIzNzQ3LjExNzI3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjEwMzAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":65847,"prevInTime":65840,"nextInTime":65842,"topicId":65841,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://www.mlive.com/news/fljournal/kelly_flynn/index.ssf?/xml/story.ssf/html_standard.xsl?/base/news-0/1050243775111240.xml ...
