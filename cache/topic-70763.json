My oldest was considering she might want to buy <br/>\nanother one at my husband&#39;s dad&#39;s shop {accually they pretty much get <br/>\nevery thing free from grampa but it was a partner&#39;s merch.}. She <br/>\nlater decided that she had one and didn&#39;t need to spend her money on <br/>\nit so put it back. <br/>\nHer grampa&#39;s wife {second marrage} was so suprised that I would let <br/>\nher have it. That was exactly what I explained. They are also pretty <br/>\ncareful with them but sometimes they like to carve soap {we use Fels <br/>\nNaptha cause I hear it is the best &lt;g&gt;} and things and pocket knives <br/>\ncome in handy. They do keep them here for now and don&#39;t carry them <br/>\naround. But it is so ironic how she seemed so shocked that i would <br/>\nallow that but she and others seems to think we are over protective <br/>\nby homeschooling.<br/>\nTracy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":101672438,"authorName":"Bill and Diane","from":"Bill and Diane &lt;cen46624@...&gt;","profile":"thegreatdiane","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] child safety -- was Hi.
