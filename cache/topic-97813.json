But it&#39;s short sighted not<br/>\n&gt; to take into account the effect on children who are leading rotten lives.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Learning something from a bad experience doesn&#39;t justify the bad<br/>\nexperience or the existence of bad experiences. There are far too many<br/>\npeople suffering<br/>\n&gt; through bad experiences who will end up damaged and pass that damage on to<br/>\nothers to suggest that because good can come from bad, that there must be a<br/>\n&gt; good reason for bad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joyce<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\nIt *is* romantic and sweet... my daughter announced to me at 2 that she had<br/>\nchosen me and her newly-born brother had chosen their dad, a huge fairy tale<br/>\nabout &quot;remembering before I was Hannah.&quot;  Even with the craziness of our<br/>\nlives, she often comes to me and tells me she&#39;s so glad she picked me ~ & I<br/>\nam too!<br/>\nThis is hitting home right now for me... My sister&#39;s kid has a pretty<br/>\npitiful life, I hate to think she&#39;s chosen it, but I&#39;m reassured that maybe<br/>\nthe choice was made less ugly with the opportunity to hang out with me and<br/>\nmy kids and temper her icky surroundings, if only for a week at a time (a<br/>\nchance she would miss if my sister was actually a parent or if the kid had<br/>\nchosen someone else).  She&#39;s 2.5 and I just think: dang! that girl must have<br/>\na *really* good reason for being here, I&#39;ll do what I can...<br/>\nJust my $.02 :)  diana </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97718,"nextTopicId":83490}}
