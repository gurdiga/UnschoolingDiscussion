They&#39;re all glass<br/>\nwith a metal filter, and depending on how much you want to pay, the filters<br/>\nare made of different metals. You just put the grounds in the bottom, pour<br/>\nin the hot water, and after a few minutes you press the filter down. Here in<br/>\nalterna-land we have organic coffee shops (no kidding!) so it&#39;s easy to find<br/>\nbody-friendly coffee and brewing mechanisms but I think these are probably<br/>\nwidely available as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) inventer of new and wonderful things<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) singer of protest songs<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21069,"nextTopicId":21078}}
