Correct me if I&#39;m wrong about any of these<br/>\ndenominations.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Is my use of the term &quot;fundamentalist Christians&quot; acceptable to those on<br/>\nthis list who have the beliefs I&#39;m describing, or is there some other term<br/>\nthey prefer?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Elsa Haas<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1694471,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","profile":"anoydami","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] teeth in carnivores","postDate":"1008725123","msgId":30079,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTkwMWMxODgzMCQ1NGM1MmFlMCQzZjVkZDFkMUBqaWRhMzU+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDExMjE4MTcxMjAzLjMwNDY4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjExMDAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30063,"nextInTopic":30093,"prevInTime":30078,"nextInTime":30080,"topicId":30063,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Omnivors, so we have fangs (eye teeth) and teeth with the ability to tear and with the strength to hold on AND we have the molars and side to side abilities","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1518696741\">Omnivors, so we have &quot;fangs&quot; (eye teeth) and teeth with the ability to tear<br/>\nand with the strength to hold on AND we have the molars and side to side<br/>\nabilities of grazers.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Corina Crane &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:corina_crane@...\">corina_crane@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 18, 2001 9:12 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] teeth in carnivores<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt; If you don&#39;t believe me, look at your teeth in the mirror.&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just had to respond to this!
