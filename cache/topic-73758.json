(I&#39;m starting to feel like Sophia) Picture <br/>\nthis, one<br/>\nof those birthing stories on cable. The mom was having the baby at <br/>\nhome and<br/>\nthe older brother was there to see the new baby come into the world. <br/>\nThe<br/>\nlittle boy was about 4. Well mom was screaming up a storm and scared <br/>\nthe<br/>\ncrap out of the little kid. They finally get him calmed down and she <br/>\nquiets<br/>\nup when you could see the baby&#39;s head. So they get the little boy to <br/>\ncome<br/>\nand see the baby and all he sees is a full head of wet black hair <br/>\n(fur?) and<br/>\nscreams with such excitement for the first time in hours that mom is <br/>\nhaving<br/>\na puppy!!!!! Poor little thing must have been disappointed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLMAO..good one Mary!  It reminded me of a birth story I watched on <br/>\nThe Baby Story.  There was this older couple having their first baby <br/>\nand they were a bit eccentric.  They videotaped EVERYTHING.  She even <br/>\nhad the camera set up for when she read her pregnancy test.  They <br/>\nwere having a natural birth and were totally into the filming and no <br/>\ndrugs, etc.  No big deal but man once she went into labor it went <br/>\ncrazy!  She is screaming about the pain, completely out of control <br/>\nwhere she is completely freaking out the husband.  They finally move <br/>\nher into the birthing room and she starts pushing.  She is <br/>\nfrantcially yelling so bad that she has the nurse starting to firmly <br/>\ncalm her down and the husband it starting to look completely <br/>\nfrazzled.  The baby is just ready to be born, head almost out and the <br/>\nnurse sees the dad looking a bit funny so she tells him to sit down.  <br/>\nShe turns around, he faints, the baby comes out, the nurse is running <br/>\nbetween him and the doctor, LMAO.  It was like a skit from Mad TV.  <br/>\nHe gets up a few sconds later and the baby is out and to top it all <br/>\noff his glasses are all askew.  It was like a comedy of errors.  That <br/>\nis one birthing video I would hide in the closet, lol!  I think what <br/>\nmade it so funny was the before attitude and the actual event.  This <br/>\nis definitly NOT one video to show at Lamaze for first time moms :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72815,"nextTopicId":73814}}
