I once had an Occupational Therapist tell me <br/>\nthat a kid who is running, jumping, swinging, hanging etc. is much less <br/>\nlikely to have problems with SID.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He says, for example, that in 1960 2 yo&#39;s spent about 200 hours in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a car (not in a car seat, either). In a recent year - (1999?) they spent 500 <br/>\nhours strapped in carseats. He says parents don&#39;t &quot;make up for&quot; the loss of <br/>\nmovement-time --- even though there is lots of evidence that points up the <br/>\nimportance of physical movement on brain development in those first few <br/>\nyears of life.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it seems the pendulum has swung so far in the cerebral direction as far <br/>\nas the first three years goes. Parents are out there with stimulating <br/>\nmobiles and video tapes. Sounds like he&#39;s saying a good trip to the park is <br/>\nthe important educational activity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He talks about how brain development is dependent on appropriate amounts <br/>\n&gt;&gt;of challenge and how difficult that is to create in a classroom -- I just <br/>\n&gt;&gt;wanted to YELL right there in the bookstore -- THE KID WILL KNOW how much <br/>\n&gt;&gt;challenge is optimal - let them work it out themselves!!!! Give them <br/>\n&gt;&gt;freedom and they&#39;ll challenge themselves JUST RIGHT!!!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You go girl! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39752,"nextTopicId":39639}}
