They asked about our schedule, and I said we&#39;re very flexible. They were concerned about interrupting Sarah&#39;s homeschooling time, and I explained about unschooling and everything and they said &quot;Wow...that&#39;s ALOT of committment!&quot; I laughed and said &quot;I&#39;m actually doing MORE than when we were using a curriculum. Then it was easy to just follow the directions and assume things would be just fine, but it wasn&#39;t much better than sending her off to school. I&#39;d sit her down with a workbook and do something else.
