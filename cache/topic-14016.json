But the second I have<br/>\nsome experience in. You could start with Advent, the four weeks before<br/>\nChristmas. There&#39;s a lot of info about Advent on-line from a Catholic<br/>\nsource. If I can manage to dig up my paperwork on it I&#39;ll let you know. (We<br/>\ndo an &quot;Advent workshop&quot; every November at church...mainly holiday crafts.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a Dorling Kindersley book (well, I&#39;m pretty sure it was DK) about<br/>\nChristmas or Winter holidays around the world. I&#39;m sure a librarian could<br/>\ndirect you to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s the history of Santa, Christmas trees, etc, etc. You can get<br/>\ntons of historical information on-line.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne book I didn&#39;t like was The Winter Solstice. Actually had bad info,<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t believe that. (about St Lucia in Sweden) I think it was over-hyped.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like listening to Christmas music from around the world. Your library<br/>\nprobably has tapes and CD&#39;s. Along with videos. And cookbooks. You could<br/>\npick just one culture to study (your ancestors maybe) or really go all out<br/>\nand try a different one every week for 6 weeks or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nA trip to the library would be the best first step, IMO.
