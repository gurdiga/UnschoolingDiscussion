Someone had mentioned &quot;slicing&quot; the cube.  Both of these<br/>\nmight help to visually get a feel of what is happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often use &#39;real&#39; objects to be models and then play with the shape or<br/>\nfigure I&#39;m trying to understand. Last year I built a tetrahedron out of<br/>\ntoothpicks to try and understand some number concepts.  Imagine what a<br/>\n&#39;cubic yard&#39; really is - it&#39;s a cube (3-D square) that&#39;s a yard on every<br/>\nside.  If you want to change the measurement to feet, then you have to think<br/>\nabout, picture, and make a model of what that will mean.  How many cubic<br/>\nfeet in the cubic yard?  Start with what you know - 3 feet in one yard.  Now<br/>\nthat cubic yard has three feet going up, across, and back (deep).  Get out<br/>\nsome cubes (blocks or dice) and say that each one is a &#39;cubic foot.&#39;  Now<br/>\nbuild your &#39;cubic yard&#39; and count how many blocks it took.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever I use the &#39;multiplication table&#39; with people (A lot of<br/>\nhomeschoolers ask for help on teaching multiplication facts) I show them how<br/>\nthe numbers form patterns, across, vertically, and diagonally.  The main<br/>\ndiagonal, down the middle, is the &#39;square numbers.&#39;  It&#39;s easier for most<br/>\npeople to understand cube numbers after they &#39;see&#39; what square numbers are<br/>\nand how they are formed.  Once someone understands what they are seeing,<br/>\nwhether it is a layer of mulch 1 foot thick, or a model either in their head<br/>\nor physical, then they can understand how to manipulate the formulae and the<br/>\nnumbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 yos doesn&#39;t like or &#39;get&#39; math very easily - it&#39;s not &#39;natural&#39; for<br/>\nhim.  One day I asked him if he wanted to learn some and he told me he&#39;ll do<br/>\nit when he needs it. This is the boy who could not spell or write much last<br/>\nyear but has dictated stories to us since he was 6 (didn&#39;t read until 8<br/>\n1/2).  He still hates physically writing,  uses block letters, but now<br/>\nbecause he uses IM all the time with his friends, because HE doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\nbe embarrassed, he has learned to spell, and type much faster than I can.<br/>\nAt first he asked me or his 20yos how to spell words, and still asks<br/>\nsometimes, but he has been using the dictionary too.  I wonder what the<br/>\nwords are that he doesn&#39;t ask? LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8yos, not reading, cares a little but not much, will do it when he wants<br/>\nto, is a math whiz.

I can say them or write them down, but he does almost all<br/>\nof it in his head.
