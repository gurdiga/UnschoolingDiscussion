This subject just seems to tickle me in <br/>\nall the right places.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, let&#39;s look at this post (and by parsing the statements in the post, I <br/>\nmean no disrespect to the poster emself (or is that erself) -- I really don&#39;t <br/>\nknow).<br/>\n<br/>\nA statement is made that &quot;Parenting is controlling child&#39;s ice cream intake, <br/>\nmaking choices for the child, on the false assumption that parent is <br/>\ninfallible.&quot;  Partly true, but mostly false.  I know that I, for one, do not <br/>\nbelieve that I, or any parent, is infallible.  Nor do I believe a child is <br/>\ninfallible.  I agree, however, that the parenting decision in this situation <br/>\ndoes, indeed, control the child&#39;s ice cream intake and &quot;make choices for the <br/>\nchild.&quot;  I am comfortable with that fact.  I am 34.  Ben is 3.  I might not <br/>\nbe infallible, but my guess is that, when it comes to making nutrition and <br/>\ndietary calls, I am less fallible than is he.<br/>\n<br/>\nA question is asked &quot;Do you really want to have to tell your child NO all the <br/>\ntime?&quot;  Um, no.  I believe I clearly stated in the original post that only <br/>\nsometimes do I say no to this bit of impulsiveness on Ben&#39;s &lt;g&gt; part.  <br/>\nHowever, if Ben wanted to go out and kill the neighbor&#39;s puppies every day &lt;<br/>\negads&gt; then yes, I would really want to have to tell him NO each and every <br/>\ntime he wanted to do that.  (And I would also want to get him some serious <br/>\noutside counseling . . . but, fortunately, my little Ben doesn&#39;t want to kill <br/>\nthe neighbors&#39; puppies . . . . or, at least, he doesn&#39;t that I know of.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe statement is made &quot;If Olivia lets Ben have ice cream whenever he wants, <br/>\nthe novelty will soon wear off, and Olivia will find that Ben eats pretty <br/>\nmuch normally and healthily by choice.&quot;  LOL.  Personally, my little Ben <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want ice cream for the novelty of it.  He wants it because it&#39;s just <br/>\nso darn yummy.  (I know this, because he told me so.)  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, and just for the record, I do not &quot;systematically&quot; deny little <br/>\nBenjamin &lt;g&gt; the ice cream he so desires.  It&#39;s just that sometimes, and for <br/>\nmy own reasons (whether they be fallible, infallible, rational, or not) I&#39;d <br/>\nprefer that the family eat pancakes for breakfast.  (And, yes, sometimes <br/>\nlittle Ben gets his with a side of ice cream, and sometimes he does not.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKate Davis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":111069617,"authorName":"Elliot Temple","from":"&quot;Elliot Temple&quot; &lt;curi@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] TCS","postDate":"1020037531","msgId":36320,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxY2IwMWMxZWYwZSRjOTVlZDMyMCRiMDc5ZmVhOUBjdXJpPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEyOS4xMDg5Y2YyNy4yOWZkZTAwMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36318,"nextInTopic":36321,"prevInTime":36319,"nextInTime":36321,"topicId":36220,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From:  ... breakfast. ...
