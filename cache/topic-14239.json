We bought the wire in 200 ft. lengths and used seven of them <br/>\ntotal.  I used a drill and a steel rod and wrapped the wire into coils and <br/>\ncut the links, one by one, and then attached them with pliers in the pattern <br/>\nneeded.  I improvised on the shirt with the sleeves (I wanted all the links <br/>\nto run the same way), but it came out okay, I think.  I should have not <br/>\nworried about the shoulder seams and the direction of the links, so I could <br/>\nhave tapered the arms, but it was my first try after all, so I&#39;m not too hard <br/>\non myself about that.  And yes, falling in mud is very medieval, but we <br/>\nhadn&#39;t taken pictures yet, which is why I&#39;m thankful he didn&#39;t have it on.  I <br/>\ncan&#39;t get a stain out for the life of me!

If you all<br/>\n&gt;remember, I didn&#39;t know whether or not ds should dress for it.  Well, we took<br/>\n&gt;the complete costume and when we got there, ds wanted nothing to do with it.<br/>\n&gt;LOL Once during the duelist shows, he wanted it on so we went to the truck<br/>\n&gt;and put it on him.  They let us come in with the sword without a problem.  Ds<br/>\n&gt;got up on the stage after the guys finished and had a duel with one of them.<br/>\n&gt;Luckily, he wanted it off right after and dh took it back to the truck, cause<br/>\n&gt;it started pouring down rain.  We were all soaked and ds fell in the mud.<br/>\n&gt;All in all, we had a great time, but it was way too expensive to go twice.  I<br/>\n&gt;wanted to share some pictures of my little knight with you all.  They were<br/>\n&gt;taken just recently and not at the festival or I would have shared them<br/>\n&gt;sooner.  I hope you enjoy them and thanks again for your help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nicholasacademy.homestead.com/pictures.html\">http://nicholasacademy.homestead.com/pictures.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cheryl<br/>\n&gt;Nicholas Academy Homeschooling Resources<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nicholasacademy.homestead.com\">http://nicholasacademy.homestead.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14243,"nextTopicId":14232}}
