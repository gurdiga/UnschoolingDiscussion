Anyway, the point was that<br/>\nmany don&#39;t unschool because they are afraid of the freedom of it.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of us give our children &quot;true&quot; freedom.  Anymore than any of us<br/>\nactually have &quot;true&quot; freedom.  (Just ask me about what I&#39;ve gone through<br/>\nlast month to get a car in PA.  And having that vehicle by the end of this<br/>\nweek is giving me a sense of freedom I can&#39;t discribe.)  We are subject to<br/>\nlaws, to nature, to our earlier choices, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy two year old would love to play in the back yard all by himself.  Only<br/>\nthere is no fence and it&#39;s not safe.  Not for a second.  Now, I can sit in<br/>\nan out of the way place in the yard and when he looks like he&#39;s headed out I<br/>\ncan go with him or entice him back in gently.  But that&#39;s an illusion of<br/>\nfreedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that I&#39;m knocking that.  That illusion is what is going to give him the<br/>\nbelief later in life that he CAN do things all by him self.  The trust in me<br/>\nand my company and guidance will allow him to trust me later when I tell him<br/>\nabout my own life.  And about why I make certain choices and hope he will<br/>\nmake similar ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s the fear of freedom that makes some people scared to<br/>\nunschool.  It&#39;s the fear of the greater responsibility that does it.  It<br/>\ntakes less to hand over schooling to someone else than it does to take it on<br/>\nourselves.  It takes less to follow someone else&#39;s structure at home than to<br/>\ntrust our kids to know what they need.  It&#39;s scary to take on all that<br/>\nresponsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we&#39;ve been told our whole lives that we CAN&#39;T take on that<br/>\nresponsibility.  That specially trained people in an institution have to do<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that one of the things that was keeping me from &quot;starting&quot;<br/>\nunschooling when I joined the list was the fear that I wasn&#39;t up to that<br/>\nresponsibility.  From reading the list and really, really watching my son<br/>\nI&#39;m learning to trust that I CAN do it.  I&#39;m not there yet, but every day I<br/>\nsee myself trusting him more and more and giving my son more and more<br/>\nchances to make his own choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill--it&#39;s a big job.  And it&#39;s a freedom with a price, just like any other<br/>\nfreedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43879,"nextTopicId":68054}}
