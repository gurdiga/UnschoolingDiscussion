The paper has dutifully earned <br/>\nits reputation as the &quot;mouthpiece&quot; of Japan&#39;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs <br/>\non just about every economic and political issue you can name. One of the <br/>\nnewspaper&#39;s past presidents, Mr. Shintaro Fukushima, in fact, has <br/>\nformerly served as Japan&#39;s ambassador to the United Nations.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for what it&#39;s worth, here&#39;s the editorial. Not too surprisingly, the <br/>\narticle never delves into the influence that Japan&#39;s oppressive school <br/>\nsystem has on the psyches of these so-called &quot;young miscreants.&quot; Oh well, <br/>\nmaybe in the next election....<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I hear a campaign soundtruck coming up the <br/>\nstreet, and I must go outside and get my daily dose of noise pollution. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian Covert<br/>\n(KnoK NEWS)<br/>\nin Osaka, Japan<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEDITORIAL - The Japan Times<br/>\nTuesday, June 20, 2000<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAGE IS NOT ALL THAT MATTERS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the volume favored by candidates&#39; loudspeaker cars, it can be <br/>\ndifficult to tell what issues they are addressing in the campaign leading <br/>\nup to Sunday&#39;s election for the House of Representatives. Both the ruling <br/>\nand opposition parties are engaging in the usual name-calling and <br/>\nsloganeering and not giving more than superficial attention to some of <br/>\nthe main concerns of potential voters. One of these is the rising tide of <br/>\njuvenile violence that parents, school authorities and the police all <br/>\nseem powerless to control.<br/>\n<br/>\nA number of heinous incidents this year have all involved 17-year-olds. <br/>\nBut as each day&#39;s news brings a fresh report of yet another case of <br/>\nyouthful criminal behavior, the age level of the perpetrators has dropped <br/>\nto as low as 15 or even 14. Meanwhile, all the political parties are <br/>\nmainly concentrating on the idea of lowering the age at which young <br/>\npeople legally become adults to 18 from the present 20. Prime Minister <br/>\nYoshiro Mori, campaigning nationwide for the Liberal Democratic Party and <br/>\nits partners in the governing coalition, is having some success in <br/>\ncontrolling his tendency to make provocative statements that embroil him <br/>\nin instant controversy. He is putting the emphasis in stump speeches on <br/>\nreducing the age at which minors can be tried in criminal courts for <br/>\nserious offenses from 16 to 14.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis appears to be what all the parties have in mind, in the wake of the <br/>\npublic&#39;s disappointment at the failure of the regular Diet session, which <br/>\nended June 2, not only to pass but even to discuss the widely heralded <br/>\nbill aimed at revising the Juvenile Law to better deal with the increase <br/>\nin youthful crimes of violence. As a result, the bill was scrapped.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe present Juvenile Law, which came into effect in 1949, stresses the <br/>\nrehabilitation of young wrongdoers. The Family Court has jurisdiction <br/>\nover cases involving young people under 20. Serious cases involving <br/>\nyouths 16 or older can be referred to prosecutors for handling in a <br/>\ncriminal court, although until recently this has rarely occurred. <br/>\nJuveniles under the age of 14 who engage in acts that legally would be <br/>\nconsidered criminal offenses are referred to a special consultation <br/>\noffice for children. But as the level of youthful violence has escalated, <br/>\nand the types of crimes perpetrated have become more serious, many people <br/>\nnow believe the law is too lenient.<br/>\n<br/>\nYoung people in Japan today certainly are more physically mature than <br/>\ntheir counterparts of half a century ago. They also are more <br/>\nsophisticated, thanks to rapid developments in mass communications and <br/>\nthe influence of unsavory elements in the media. Whether they are more <br/>\nmature emotionally is debatable. Many are clever enough to admit, if <br/>\nchallenged, that they are sometimes tempted into risky behavior by the <br/>\nknowledge that they will be treated lightly if they happen to get caught.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the youth of Japan are to be empowered to vote from the age of 18, a <br/>\nstep many other nations have already taken, then it stands to reason that <br/>\nthe Juvenile Law should be revised to apply to young people under that <br/>\nage. Before this is done, however, any proposed revisions must be <br/>\ndiscussed and debated in detail, with testimony provided by educators and <br/>\nlaw-enforcement officials. Voters should not allow politicians to fall <br/>\nback on hollow promises. Vague suggestions of cracking down on teenage <br/>\ncriminal behavior do not solve the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue is not simply the age of the culprits. The larger question is <br/>\nwhy so many young people in this country now resort to violence so <br/>\neasily. A recent survey of male junior and senior high school students by <br/>\nthe Management and Coordination Agency found that the older they are the <br/>\nmore likely they are to consider physically attacking their parents or <br/>\nteachers. The National Police Agency has just reported that police <br/>\nthroughout the nation arrested 31 male juveniles suspected of murder or <br/>\nattempted murder from the beginning of this year through the end of <br/>\nApril, double the number in the same period of 1999.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is all too easy, however, to use the threat of severer punishments as <br/>\na cure-all. Some youthful lawbreakers deserve and require time in <br/>\njuvenile reformatories, or possibly even in adult prisons. The motives <br/>\nfor the violence and the warning signs that are often ignored by parents <br/>\nand teachers need to be considered. Too-hasty moves to incarcerate young <br/>\nmiscreants with adult offenders will only succeed in turning more of them <br/>\ninto hardened criminals.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Copyright - The Japan Times: June 20, 2000]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3648,"nextTopicId":9491}}
