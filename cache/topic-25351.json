I read it and deleted it yesterday<br/>\nmorning and spent most of the day with my kids and some of their friends.<br/>\n Just because I deleted it does not mean it went away though.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my most interesting thought about it:  My entire family has<br/>\ninherited genes that predispose us to certain psychological problems.  Of<br/>\nall my children only one has ended up in a psych ward (and more than<br/>\nonce). Which child?  The one I gave up and who was being raised by<br/>\nparents that went through screening and such.  They were and are great<br/>\nparents but they had no idea what to do to help Amy.  The fact that I<br/>\nhave kept the three I have from self-destructing seems to me at least to<br/>\nbe a major accomplishment.  And with that last post, Sandra lost any<br/>\nrespect I had for her.  Until then, I felt she had the right to speak her<br/>\nmind and if we didn&#39;t agree that was fine, but when she essentially<br/>\ncalled me a bad mother and the cause of my children&#39;s problems, well, she<br/>\nlost me.  I am no longer listening to her.  Oh sure, I&#39;ll read her posts<br/>\nbut it is with an attitude of, &quot;So what, she types before she knows<br/>\nwhereof she speaks.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - Brenda&#39;s attack on my family ran a close second here.

It comes across as a <br/>\npersonal attack, not only on what Bridget does, but on Bridget herself and <br/>\neven her children. Bridget&#39;s posts and the subsequent list discussion have <br/>\ngiven me lots to think about. I am sure that whater her view of unschooling, <br/>\nwhich we can debate (and have debated) ad infinitum, she is doing her best <br/>\nas a parent for the children she loves. That is my assumption about everyone <br/>\nhere, and in fact about parents in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra&#39;s posts, too, often give me a lot to think about, but now I&#39;m <br/>\nbasically thinking about how absurdly judgmental she is.
