As a<br/>\n  Christian, I firmly believe in spanking and it truly works for us.  He is<br/>\nnot<br/>\n  allowed to test us...we don&#39;t do the &quot;1,2,3&quot; thing.  We believe that if he<br/>\nis<br/>\n  allowed to get away with something even once...like with &quot;come here<br/>\nplease.<br/>\n  I said, come here please.  If you don&#39;t come here you will get a time<br/>\nout.&quot;<br/>\n  We don&#39;t repeat ourselves...and if we have to...then he gets a spanking.<br/>\n  People can&#39;t believe it when I ask him to do something and he just says<br/>\n&quot;ok<br/>\n  Mom&quot;.  He has just learned and respects that we are his parents and that<br/>\nin<br/>\n  some cases if he doesn&#39;t listen the FIRST time...it could lead to harm.<br/>\n  (getting hit by a car, for example).  Reb Bradley has a book out called,<br/>\n  &quot;Child Training Tips&quot;.  That is great and there is also a parenting video<br/>\n  series that deal with the &quot;point of disobedience&quot; type of discipline.<br/>\n  And...you may spank a few times at the beginning..as they adjust...then<br/>\nyou<br/>\n  find it&#39;s rare.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That&#39;s how we discipline and it works great.  I just believe that he...and<br/>\n  our 1 1/2 yr. old and 3 mth. old...need to be raised to know we are in<br/>\n  charge...and they need to be able to obey us...so that as adults...it is<br/>\n  easier for them to obey God&#39;s word.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As far as swearing....we also don&#39;t swear...and it would abslolutely NOT<br/>\nbe<br/>\n  tolerated...but of course...just handled the same way.  If he is aware<br/>\nthat<br/>\n  he is not supposed to do it...he&#39;d get a spanking.  Of course...we don&#39;t<br/>\n  spank if he just plain did not know he wasn&#39;t supposed to do<br/>\nsomething...but<br/>\n  with the obvious...we do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  :-)  Bridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I was wondering how the first born <br/>\nis <br/>\n<br/>\ndoing now? Do you see any major differences because of how that child was <br/>\n<br/>\nraised as far as the spankings and restrictions and all?**<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not possible to say, because that isn&#39;t the only difference in how they <br/>\nwere raised.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe oldest went to school for 6 years, the second never, and the youngest <br/>\nhave always lived in an unschooling home. That alone has caused HUGE <br/>\ndifferences in how they perceive the world and interact with it, how they <br/>\nthink of themselves, their interactions with other people, everything. In <br/>\naddition, the oldest carries a different genetic load than the others, and <br/>\nlived in a more unpredictable and unstable environment for many of his early <br/>\nyears. There are also huge differences in basic personality, from infancy <br/>\nonward. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can say that spanking was generally ineffective for us in changing <br/>\nbehaviour. <br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly enough, in the context of this conversation, I decided we were <br/>\ngoing to give up spankings and school at pretty much the same time. I didn&#39;t <br/>\nconsider the decisions to be related to each other until much later, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Bridget&#39;s postings/time on-list","postDate":"1035602998","msgId":48145,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4Mi4xMGQ0MjIwZS4yYWViNjYzNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48135,"nextInTopic":48149,"prevInTime":48144,"nextInTime":48146,"topicId":47898,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/25/02 9:13:17 PM, Ozarkren@ripinternet.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-956067025\">In a message dated 10/25/02 9:13:17 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Ozarkren@...\">Ozarkren@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; She&#39;s been here (according to yahoogroups) since 9/19/02. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, then I was wrong.

I just believe that he...and <br/>\nour 1 1/2 yr. old and 3 mth. old...need to be raised to know we are in <br/>\ncharge...and they need to be able to obey us...so that as adults...it is <br/>\neasier for them to obey God&#39;s word.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as swearing....we also don&#39;t swear...and it would abslolutely NOT be <br/>\ntolerated...but of course...just handled the same way.  If he is aware that <br/>\nhe is not supposed to do it...he&#39;d get a spanking.  Of course...we don&#39;t <br/>\nspank if he just plain did not know he wasn&#39;t supposed to do something...but <br/>\nwith the obvious...we do.<br/>\n<br/>\n:-)  Bridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Spanking/not spanking","postDate":"1035521852","msgId":47910,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYzN0ZUQTdPSWtVcUxwSGthdGQwMDAwMzdhMEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":47898,"nextInTopic":48000,"prevInTime":47909,"nextInTime":47911,"topicId":47898,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And<br/>\nmoms that started out spanking and stopped by  learning better ways?**<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are really spread out in age. 6 1/2 years between the first and <br/>\nsecond, then another 7 1/2 years before the third and fourth were born (of <br/>\ncourse, those two are only 13 minutes apart so I guess that evens things out. <br/>\n&lt;gg&gt; ) I had a lot of time to learn from my mistakes, time to breathe and <br/>\nthink before another child hit the same stage/age/behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest was spanked. Designated punishments, restrictions, groundings, <br/>\n&quot;logical consequences&quot;, probably the whole basketful of standard american <br/>\nparenting practices. The second was spanked once. She&#39;ll never forget it, <br/>\nthough both she and I can no longer remember what it was for. The 10yos have <br/>\nnever been spanked. My youngest son was horrified when he recently learned <br/>\nwhat spanking is - I guess he&#39;s been kind of sheltered.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGreat results?
