There&#39;s also migraines, dropping things, poor memory and word<br/>\nrecall, irritable bowel syndrome, flu-like achiness,  missing your mouth<br/>\nwhen you try to drink, swelling in hands, and difficulty shaking a virus.<br/>\nMy favorite book on the subject is &quot;Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain<br/>\nSyndrome&quot; by Devin Starlanyl and Mary Ellen Copeland.  I know they have a<br/>\nwebsite too.    There is a LOT of misinformation out there, and I really<br/>\nthink it&#39;s just a word used to describe something that doctors haven&#39;t<br/>\nfigured out yet.  They do know that I have candida (too much yeast in the<br/>\nintestines) and some minor food allergies, but that doesn&#39;t really explain<br/>\nmost of the symptoms.   I was diagnosed in 1991, and every doctor I&#39;ve been<br/>\nto in the past ten years has heard of it, but not every one has taken it<br/>\nseriously or known a lot about it.  Unfortunately, I have not found much<br/>\nrelief, and have tried many medications and therapies.  I would recommend<br/>\nseeing an osteopath, as they seem to be able to feel where your pain is and<br/>\nprovide some massage therapy.   I would also go to as many doctors as it<br/>\ntakes until you are listened too.   My life is profoundly affected, as you<br/>\nsaid, but you do learn to deal with it.   If you have any specific questions<br/>\nabout it I&#39;ll be happy to answer them.  I hope you don&#39;t have it! - Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: DiamondAir [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:diamondair@...\">diamondair@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 31, 2001 1:04 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] FMS and multiple allergies, was Say...

When I first heard about it, and indeed when I first took my son in to<br/>\nbe treated, it just seemed totally hokey and impossible to me. But it<br/>\nreally, really works! When I took my son in for his first NAET treatment, he<br/>\nhad endured 4 months of hives due to food allergies that we couldn&#39;t pin<br/>\ndown. He had been to pediatricians and allergists, poked with needles for<br/>\nallergy tests that were inconclusive and told us nothing. The best that the<br/>\ndoctors and allergists could come up with was a prescription for long-term<br/>\nClaritin use and an Epipen just in case he went in to anaphylactic shock.<br/>\nThat and a diet that avoided just about everything edible on earth. We<br/>\nexisted on Millet bread and rice cheese for months before I found NAET. When<br/>\nI took him in for his first treatment, I didn&#39;t give him any antihistamines<br/>\nthat morning, because I thought it might interfere. By the time his<br/>\nappointment rolled around, he was covered in huge welty hives from head to<br/>\ntoe, and his face and hands were swelling up. Within literally minutes of<br/>\nthe start of the NAET treatment, the hives started disappearing before my<br/>\nvery eyes. They came back for about 5 hours after his 2nd NAET treatment and<br/>\nhave not been back since! So far we have had him &quot;cleared&quot; of 5 of his food<br/>\nallergies and are eating all kinds of things we hadn&#39;t eaten in months. I<br/>\ncan&#39;t describe how happy I am not to see my little guy swollen up, itching,<br/>\nand covered in hives. Not to mention eating Quinoa pasta (blech!).<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of mine&#39;s mother had fibromalgyia and Crohn&#39;s disease, and was<br/>\nbasically debilitated by pain.
