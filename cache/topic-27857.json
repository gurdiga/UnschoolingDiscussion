Or<br/>\nwhy isn&#39;t<br/>\nshe doing algebra?  Or when are we gonna stop all this<br/>\ntouchy feely stuff and<br/>\ndo some real school work? ... Stuff like that.  <br/>\nOn one hand I KNOW that he has experienced only public and<br/>\nivy league stuff and hasn&#39;t <br/>\nhad the benefit of mixed experiences like I did.  At the<br/>\nsame time I FEEL that he should<br/>\nknow better anyway - I mean if he was miserable then why<br/>\nwould he expect that she would go to school and be<br/>\necstatic?  He was forced to use textbooks and so forth and<br/>\nhe knows the truth of what you can actually get out of them<br/>\n(not much) so why force that on her?  !!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time I KNOW he knows that she is one smart<br/>\ncookie and is soo much more advanced than the average<br/>\nconventionally schooled child, in so many ways.  She didn&#39;t<br/>\nstart reading until 2 years ago but she is already reading<br/>\nat 10th grade level now, for instance.  Reading and<br/>\ncomprehending.  She is a bright, articulate, polite and<br/>\nwell adjusted little girl, who may not have the easiest<br/>\ntime with fractions or multiplication tables but can hold<br/>\nher own discussing finance and free trade with anyone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like hey, she&#39;ll get around to that other stuff when<br/>\nits time for her to and it is not fair or even decent to<br/>\npush and shove her with the usual methods.  At the same<br/>\ntime<br/>\nhe really does pay the lion share for her school work and<br/>\nhe IS her father so I feel like I owe it to him to respect<br/>\nhis feelings and input.  I guess I&#39;m fairly conflicted, eh?<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I just wanted to say thankyou to everybody that<br/>\nanswered my plea and also say Keep it Coming! <br/>\nOoh - I recently signed up for the Discovery Channel book<br/>\nclub (following up on a hint from Dan) which has some<br/>\nreally great (albeit EXPEN$IVE) stuff.

Two separate things!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the former, ask him to read John Holts How Children Fail, which shows<br/>\nhow the program interferes with true intellectual development.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the latter, I dont know what to say. Maybe Stanley Milgrams Obedience<br/>\nto Authority, which describes the horrifying results of experiments used to<br/>\nsee how far people will go in obeying, would help him start to question this<br/>\ngoal. But its a major change in thinking. Its hard to change anybodys<br/>\nthinking on something so profound.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou dont say how old your daughter is, so I dont know whether it might<br/>\nhelp to enlist her in calming her dads fears. It could be a kind of secret<br/>\ntrick, something to whisper with her about. My husband suggested something<br/>\nlike this for a friend of ours whose husband is worried that their kids,<br/>\nhomeschooling for the second year after having been schooled, arent<br/>\nlearning enough. My husband said, Okay, so you take a childrens<br/>\nencyclopedia like the Dorling Kindersley ones, and every day each kid finds<br/>\none thing in it to impress their father with when he gets home from work.<br/>\nOne single fact, like, You know what they do with guinea pigs in Peru?

This is trivia, but it might reassure the guy. If your<br/>\ndaughter could see it as a game (Impress Daddy, or Stump Daddy) - or even as<br/>\na dumb chore for helping out her poor father who was damaged by being in<br/>\nschool for too long - she might go along with it, as a stop-gap measure<br/>\nuntil her own interests take over and she really does want to tell him<br/>\nstuff.

Holt<br/>\nAssociates used to sell good nature and science books  Im thinking of the<br/>\nBrown Paper Bag Series, for one  so there might still be a good selection<br/>\nthere. There were some coloring books on subjects like human anatomy at one<br/>\ntime, too. Theyre used in college courses, but some kids like them.
