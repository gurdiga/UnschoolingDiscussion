The others are 15 and 17.   She says she wants an efficiency apartment, and she&#39;s always scoping out apartments when she gets a chance.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut she also talks about moving to Madrid (a small mining town here in New Mexico) or Chama (far northern New Mexico).  And she talks about staying in the house with whichever parent lives longest. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe thinks about moving a lot, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids have all called stuff they want.  We ended up with way too many glasses a while back (we have two patterns we replenish from thrift stores when too many have broken) so I packed one set up, and maybe the first kid to move out gets them, but if Kirby&#39;s first, he&#39;s dibsed the set we&#39;re using now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s fine with me.  There&#39;s very little I wouldn&#39;t willingly give them, and drive it over and help them set it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not in a hurry for anyone to leave, but I hope when they do leave that it&#39;s happy, not reactionary, not scary for me, and not an act of hostility for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd unlike other friends of mine, I don&#39;t intend to strip the kid&#39;s room the second he&#39;s gone.  A friend of ours went to college (which isn&#39;t usually permanent) and her mom had her room stripped and repainted in a couple of weeks.  Marty was hired to go move the furniture.  I felt like he was betraying a friend, in a way (didn&#39;t say so, though).  That  seemed so sad!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a kid gets married, heck yes, strip the room.  But to college?
