You can find it in the archives. I told myself Ethan had a sleeping disorder -- phase shift disorder or something like that. I received very insightful replies, like yourself. Like yourself, my question was motivated by my own fear of him not being able to fulfill his commitments, both at that particular time, and into his future. The advice I received gave me the confidence to continue moving forward in my partnership with Ethan. In time, I&#39;ve had the wonderful opportunity to witness my son become very clear about where he wants to spend his energy. He has a great deal of integrity. If he makes a commitment, he keeps it. Consequently, he makes commitments thoughtfully and cautiously. Sometimes I&#39;ll ask him if he wants to do something and he&#39;ll say &quot;Let me think about that.&quot; His decision to agree or not to agree is based on what he has learned about himself through the choices that are made available to him. &nbsp;That&#39;s been pretty cool and hugely enlightening to see.</span><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;\"><br></span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;\"><span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;\">Karen James.</span></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-945099384ygrps-yiv-717899542\"><br></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"","from":"plaidpanties666@...","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Ideas for changing sleep cycle","postDate":"1403222445","msgId":74449,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxudnRqZCtyZ3RmZ3FAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEZGMTdBNTQxLTRFRjgtNDcyQS1COTMzLUUwODZBNTkzQTE3QUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PEZGMTdBNTQxLTRFRjgtNDcyQS1COTMzLUUwODZBNTkzQTE3QUBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":74445,"nextInTopic":74450,"prevInTime":74448,"nextInTime":74450,"topicId":74433,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Shuts off all electronic devices one hour prior to the time he wants to fall asleep at.<br>\n2. Drinks a glass of warm milk, which has tryptophan. <br>\n3. We have black out shades in his room so the room gets really dark.<br>\n4. Sometimes he uses a sleep mask for extra darkness.<br>\n5. He usually reads in bed for about 30 minutes to an hour to help him settle down.<br>\n <br>\nSome other tips for sleeping are journaling in bed if your son likes to write. Keeping the temperature cool (68-70 degrees Fahrenheit).  And lastly, listening to relaxation CDs or on his ipod (or whatever music device you have) can help lull the mind to sleep.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Good luck! I&#39;m sure like Joyce said, just knowing he has to wake up will be a driving force to solve his challenge. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Warmly,<br>\nMegan</p>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1924151387gmail_quote\">On Jun 19, 2014 7:16 AM, &quot;Joyce Fetteroll <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfetteroll@...\">jfetteroll@...</a> [AlwaysLearning]&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br>\n<blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-1924151387gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span> </span>\n\n\n<div>\n  <div>\n\n\n    <div>\n      \n      \n      <p><br><div><div>On Jun 19, 2014, at 8:44 AM, Ali Zeljo <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:azeljo@...\">azeljo@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div>\n<br><blockquote type=\"cite\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;\">Has anyone else here had success making an intentional shift in sleep cycle?</span></blockquote>\n</div><br><div>I think the biggest incentive to get up early will be needing to be at camp that day.</div><div><br></div><div>That first day he&#39;ll be tired!
