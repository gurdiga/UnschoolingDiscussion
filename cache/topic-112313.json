Each kid was an individual - when you only have five  <br/>\nkids in the 4th grade, it isn&#39;t so much important for kids to have a  <br/>\ndiagnosis, a label, as it is that the parent and teacher communicate  <br/>\nwell about that particular kid and how he/she is learning, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t supposed to be about school - I left my main point unsaid  <br/>\n- the ONLY reason that anybody needed to use the word &quot;dyslexic&quot;  <br/>\nabout my niece EVEN though she was in school, was for my sister to  <br/>\ncommunicate well with her teachers and to look for ideas/information  <br/>\nthat would help her learn in her own way. An unschooler, with NO time  <br/>\npressure, no standards pressures, etc., really doesn&#39;t have need to  <br/>\nlabel their child. I NEVER labeled any of mine, and I was able to  <br/>\nfeel free to look up dyslexia, when my youngest had a lot of  <br/>\nfrustration because she wanted to read and couldn&#39;t, yet. She may or  <br/>\nmay not be &quot;diagnosable&quot; - I have no idea, now that she&#39;s 15 and  <br/>\nfigured out her own ways (compensations). She would have been  <br/>\ndiagnosed, I think, back then.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing the terms to look up ideas - I can understand that. But not to  <br/>\nlabel the child - that seems unnecessarily risky.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who learn &quot;differently&quot; need to be helped to understand that  <br/>\nEVERYBODY learns in their own way. But unschoolers know that - it is  <br/>\nthe &quot;norm&quot; for unschoolers. They don&#39;t need a name for it - they need  <br/>\nto know that they are unique and that&#39;s great.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 22, 2006, at 10:47 AM, elainegh8 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  The extra help he got was money for a PC, and a recorder thingy<br/>\n&gt; (can&#39;t remember the name), for recording lectures.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8037645,"authorName":"elainegh8","from":"&quot;elainegh8&quot; &lt;elainegh8@...&gt;","profile":"elainegh8","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Learning Styles  and &#39;Dys&#39; lexia","postDate":"1140634029","msgId":112336,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR0aWJqZCtydjc2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM2NDAwRDg0LUJCNDUtNDBGMC1CRUE3LUFBNkFDMzY5OTZGQUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":112335,"nextInTopic":112337,"prevInTime":112335,"nextInTime":112337,"topicId":112313,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My partner found out in his final year, as a mature student in his late twenties, at University (I had thought it was his 2nd year) that he was dyslexic.

I have no symptoms of dyslexia and never  <br/>\nhave, but it&#39;s not freakishly unusual for me to say something like  <br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s on the refrigerator&quot; and someone will say (kindly) &quot;the  <br/>\nrefrigerator we wash the clothes in?&quot;  And after a pause to visualize  <br/>\nwhere the thing is I&#39;ll say...  &quot;Yes.  That one.&quot;   It happens when  <br/>\nI&#39;m hungry, tired, or very distracted.  The first time it happened, I  <br/>\nwas twelve or thirteen and couldn&#39;t think of any word for that flat  <br/>\nasphalt thing in front of our house that the cars drive on except  <br/>\n&quot;trail.&quot;   I fished for a better word, and got &quot;trail.&quot;  Then the  <br/>\nentire thesaurus of my mind came back to me and I had road, street,  <br/>\npavement... but for a moment there, I didn&#39;t have them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a word for forgetting nouns too, isn&#39;t there?  dis-something- <br/>\nia.
