Please don&#39;t take this as a criticism. I tell this to <br/>\nanyone who says they watch movies about war with their children so they see <br/>\nwhat guns do to people. <br/>\nObviously you know that movies aren&#39;t real. BUT sometimes people think that <br/>\nsome of the things portrayed in movies are. One thing most movies don&#39;t do is <br/>\nshow, realistically, what guns do to people who have been shot. My cousin was <br/>\nshot by an abusive exboyfriend. Part of his defense at his trial was that he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know he had actually shot her and killed her because when the gun went <br/>\noff she didn&#39;t fall backwards or go flying backwards like in the movies. <br/>\n(sick, I know.) He said she got a shocked look on her face and sat down. He <br/>\nleft, because he said he thought he had just *scared her real good.* He said <br/>\nthat had he known that she was injured he would have helped her. So I tell <br/>\npeople this because I want people to know that just because in movies people <br/>\nstumble around, moan and groan, fly backwards, and all that, it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nalways happen like that in real life. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Tia-Paths of Learning","postDate":"1030651711","msgId":42510,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0YS4xMzNhMzVjZi4yYTlmZDkzZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42508,"nextInTopic":42511,"prevInTime":42509,"nextInTime":42511,"topicId":42408,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/29/02 1:45:30 PM, ljbakavery@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1634538104\">In a message dated 8/29/02 1:45:30 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ljbakavery@...\">ljbakavery@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Richard P.

The kids actually took knife safety and gun safety, and own their own Moro knives (a real wood whittlin&#39;, survival type item -- not as cool as a dagger but still potentially dangerous) from their time in Junior Forest Wardens.  They also use sharp knives in the kitchen, and have from the time they were three (thanks to The Continuum Concept by Jean Liedloff).
