First, the hospital had to<br/>\ntell<br/>\n&gt; the parents it was measles. I&#39;ve seen measles; I&#39;ve had measles (TWICE as<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; child, although they assure people once does it) and you can tell when you<br/>\n&gt; have measles.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now another thing I saw yesterday was The Grinch movie.  The mayor had had<br/>\n&gt; his tonsils out twice! &lt;g&gt;   Holly asked what tonsils were.  I told her<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re a couple of little things in the throat that they used to cut out<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; everybody, but now they don&#39;t.  I told her that the swollen place she had<br/>\nhad<br/>\n&gt; low under her chin (I touched the place) might have been one, but no<br/>\nproblem<br/>\n&gt; (the swelling went down in one day).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mine were cut out when I was five.  Hooray for modern medicine.  I&#39;m SURE<br/>\n&gt; they told my parents if they didn&#39;t consent I would die.  I&#39;m sure medical<br/>\nTV<br/>\n&gt; shows in those days would&#39;ve had no compunction about showing a family<br/>\n&gt; hesitating about a tonscilectomy and the kid dying without a whimper.   I<br/>\n&gt; remember the ride to the emergency room at night.  I was standing in the<br/>\nback<br/>\n&gt; seat of the car throwing up in to a basin in the front seat.  The next day<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; was taken back, to a day clinic (I didn&#39;t spend the night either time),<br/>\nwhere<br/>\n&gt; in a big prep room a nurse smiled, showed me a big piece of cheesecloth<br/>\n&gt; folded up and said, &quot;Do you want to smell my perfume?&quot;  I nodded.   It was<br/>\n&gt; ether.  I saw it coming and smelled the not-at-all-perfume, and all went<br/>\n&gt; black.  That could&#39;ve been the last thing I ever saw, and it would have<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n&gt; a lie from an expert who&#39;d scared my parents practically to death.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why would infected tonsils make a kid puke, y&#39;think?  Puking is a symptom<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; tonscilitis?<br/>\n&gt; (Maybe it is, but it seems goofy to me.  If I was clear to puke my throat<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t swollen shut.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Other than that, I have no opinion. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"uNmRXFIAsPgIojKD7AFUew33Lqq9uphUmEWAe8vPY85xn1N7mSGtyisSIK6n75nG9fuijtDAP7lDYNCi3cGfWCEpcQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] ER and vaccinations","postDate":"982350038","msgId":16502,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxNWYwMWMwOTg0ZiRmZjY2MzJlMCQ5ZDVkZDFkMUBsZGlvbm5vPg==","referencesHeader":"PEY5MUVOQTlGVURHeUlYWWV2NmgwMDAwMjU3YUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":16496,"nextInTopic":16503,"prevInTime":16501,"nextInTime":16503,"topicId":16482,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Besides the vaccine, who were the sponsors of that episode??

I thought this was a free country.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok.  I&#39;m done venting.  I was a little annoyed last night and I&#39;m still<br/>\n&gt; annoyed.<br/>\n&gt; April<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1007<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: 16 Feb 2001 10:14:43 -0000<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Check it all out at: http://www.unschooling.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Post message: Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Unsubscribe: Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt;List owner: Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt;List settings page: http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;There are 14 messages in this issue.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Topics in this digest:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       1.

Sorry. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, there&#39;s hope. I used to be a packrat, and we have a fairly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; junk-free<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; house now. The only thing I still have too many of is pictures and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; books,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but everything else is under control. My hubby is a neat freak who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has won<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me over slowly but surely and weaned me off of my packrat ways. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; come<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a long line of packrats though. We just spent the weekend at my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mom&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; house<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (ugh!) and this cracked me up: she said to my son &quot;Don&#39;t step on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that pile<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of magazines. Do you just stand all over the magazines at your own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; house?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my mind I&#39;m thinking &quot;No mom, because we don&#39;t HAVE piles of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; magazines<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all over our house&quot;, honestly, the word &quot;childproofing&quot; means<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her, she has piles of stuff everywhere and I have a 16 month old -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ack!.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grandma&#39;s house is worse. She can no longer use one of her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bathrooms<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is full of stuff, and hasn&#39;t eaten a  meal on her dining room<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; table in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least 15 years, it&#39;s been buried in stuff. She just has little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pathways<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through everything, piles of old newspapers, magazines, sheet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; music, etc..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We don&#39;t go over there anymore. My niece (age 6) said the funniest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last time we were there, she said &quot;If there was an earthquake when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all visiting Grandma M&#39;s house, we&#39;d all die of paper cuts&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In any case, there&#39;s hope. I listened to a talk radio show on my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from my mom&#39;s house. It had the author of &quot;Clutter&#39;s Last Stand&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on as the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guest. He just wrote a new book called something like &quot;Lose 200<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pounds<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weekend&quot; (meaning 200 pounds of stuff) and he had a bunch of great<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tips<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; de-cluttering, if anyone&#39;s interested...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Blue Skies!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    -Robin-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;This is a great life!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Asa (10/5/99) Who walks backwards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers   Flying Clevenger Family<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Check it all out at: http://www.unschooling.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Post message: Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unsubscribe: Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; List owner: Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; List settings page:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

I was so upset.  I usually DO watch ER, but I probably won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;anymore.  It sounded like a public service anouncement. It made parents who<br/>\n&gt;chose not immunize sound STUPID STUPID STUPID<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Really, how often does someone actually get one of these diseases when they<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t immunize their children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;doctor: &quot;rich people think only poor kids get immunized and they don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt;to, if everyone stopped immunizing small pox would come back, polio...&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;mother: &quot;But there&#39;s a link between vaccinations and autism.  Doctor:  <br/>\n&gt;There<br/>\n&gt;is no link!!!!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;mother: &quot;is my son going to be alright?&quot; doctor:  &quot;1 in 500 children with<br/>\n&gt;measles die&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;and then of course there was a commercial during ER promoting some vaccine.<br/>\n&gt;I think it was hepatitis.  It said &quot;1 and 10,000 people die from hep(?)&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The whole thing just infuriates.  The vacc. issue has been on my mind a lot<br/>\n&gt;lately because my husband wants to go to school in the evenings but he is<br/>\n&gt;required to take certain vacc. first, which is ridiculous considering that<br/>\n&gt;the Army has already forced him to take SO many shots, including the flu<br/>\n&gt;shot, and he most certainly have to take the anthrax shot before he goes to<br/>\n&gt;Kosovo.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If I want to use the hourly daycare so that I can go to a doctor&#39;s appt.<br/>\n&gt;(they will not allow children to accompany me during appt) then my kids&#39;<br/>\n&gt;shot records have to be up to date.  So if I don&#39;t do that then how am I<br/>\n&gt;supposed to get my teeth cleaned or whatever???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I mean, it&#39;s getting to where people can&#39;t make their own decisions<br/>\n&gt;anymore!!!!

Sorry. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, there&#39;s hope. I used to be a packrat, and we have a fairly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; junk-free<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; house now. The only thing I still have too many of is pictures and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; books,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but everything else is under control. My hubby is a neat freak who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has won<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me over slowly but surely and weaned me off of my packrat ways. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; come<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a long line of packrats though. We just spent the weekend at my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mom&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; house<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (ugh!) and this cracked me up: she said to my son &quot;Don&#39;t step on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that pile<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of magazines. Do you just stand all over the magazines at your own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; house?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my mind I&#39;m thinking &quot;No mom, because we don&#39;t HAVE piles of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; magazines<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all over our house&quot;, honestly, the word &quot;childproofing&quot; means<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her, she has piles of stuff everywhere and I have a 16 month old -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ack!.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grandma&#39;s house is worse. She can no longer use one of her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bathrooms<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is full of stuff, and hasn&#39;t eaten a  meal on her dining room<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; table in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least 15 years, it&#39;s been buried in stuff. She just has little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pathways<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through everything, piles of old newspapers, magazines, sheet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; music, etc..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We don&#39;t go over there anymore. My niece (age 6) said the funniest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last time we were there, she said &quot;If there was an earthquake when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all visiting Grandma M&#39;s house, we&#39;d all die of paper cuts&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In any case, there&#39;s hope. I listened to a talk radio show on my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from my mom&#39;s house. It had the author of &quot;Clutter&#39;s Last Stand&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on as the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guest. He just wrote a new book called something like &quot;Lose 200<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pounds<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weekend&quot; (meaning 200 pounds of stuff) and he had a bunch of great<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tips<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; de-cluttering, if anyone&#39;s interested...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Blue Skies!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    -Robin-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;This is a great life!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Asa (10/5/99) Who walks backwards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers   Flying Clevenger Family<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Check it all out at: http://www.unschooling.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Post message: Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unsubscribe: Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; List owner: Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; List settings page:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

Sorry. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, there&#39;s hope. I used to be a packrat, and we have a fairly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; junk-free<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; house now. The only thing I still have too many of is pictures and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; books,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but everything else is under control. My hubby is a neat freak who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has won<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me over slowly but surely and weaned me off of my packrat ways. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; come<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a long line of packrats though. We just spent the weekend at my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mom&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; house<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (ugh!) and this cracked me up: she said to my son &quot;Don&#39;t step on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that pile<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of magazines. Do you just stand all over the magazines at your own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; house?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In my mind I&#39;m thinking &quot;No mom, because we don&#39;t HAVE piles of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; magazines<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all over our house&quot;, honestly, the word &quot;childproofing&quot; means<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nothing to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her, she has piles of stuff everywhere and I have a 16 month old -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ack!.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grandma&#39;s house is worse. She can no longer use one of her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bathrooms<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it is full of stuff, and hasn&#39;t eaten a  meal on her dining room<br/>\n&gt; &gt; table in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; least 15 years, it&#39;s been buried in stuff. She just has little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pathways<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through everything, piles of old newspapers, magazines, sheet<br/>\n&gt; &gt; music, etc..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We don&#39;t go over there anymore. My niece (age 6) said the funniest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; last time we were there, she said &quot;If there was an earthquake when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all visiting Grandma M&#39;s house, we&#39;d all die of paper cuts&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In any case, there&#39;s hope. I listened to a talk radio show on my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; way back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from my mom&#39;s house. It had the author of &quot;Clutter&#39;s Last Stand&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on as the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guest. He just wrote a new book called something like &quot;Lose 200<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pounds<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weekend&quot; (meaning 200 pounds of stuff) and he had a bunch of great<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tips<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; de-cluttering, if anyone&#39;s interested...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Blue Skies!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    -Robin-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;This is a great life!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Asa (10/5/99) Who walks backwards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers   Flying Clevenger Family<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Check it all out at: http://www.unschooling.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Post message: Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unsubscribe: Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; List owner: Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; List settings page:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
