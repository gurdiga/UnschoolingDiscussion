It is enough to make intelligent, caring, NON-paranoid<br/>\nwomen wonder if there really is a patriarchal plot! How come even &quot;Living<br/>\nDoll&quot; (you know that old Cliff Richard song? )well, its lyrics say &quot;Gonna<br/>\nlock her up in a trunk/so no big hunk/can steal her away from me!&quot; Honestly<br/>\nonce you start listening to lyrics it is amazing how misogynist they are and<br/>\nyet witness all the outrage over one song that paints a different picture?<br/>\nGRRRRRRR<br/>\nBy the way, ever notice that there is no word for someone who dislikes men?<br/>\nI know there is man-hater but that is a &quot;made-up word&quot; if you will. It is OK<br/>\nto be misanthropic (hate everyone) or misogynist (hate women) but hating<br/>\nJust men??? nah, why would anyone?? (Sarcastic voice and mean eyes!!)<br/>\nFor every one film like Thelma and Louise (in which I think they killed one<br/>\nmaybe two men and yet the movie critics etc referred to their &quot;murderous<br/>\nrampage!!!&quot;) there are hundreds that depict women being disrespected,<br/>\nassaulted, raped or killed! I am NOT advocating that we make more films<br/>\nshowing women abusing or assaulting men - just pointing out that even today<br/>\nwomen&#39;s mistreatment is the norm.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste<br/>\nBrooke</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7714,"nextTopicId":7868}}
