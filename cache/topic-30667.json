I found<br/>\nthe site www.soulcysters.com  to have lots of info and links with good<br/>\narticles and research.  The symptoms I can think of off the topof my head<br/>\ninclude......Irregular menstrual cycles (Under 21 days or over 35 or very<br/>\nunpredictable,  hirutism (excess facial hair),  male pattern baldness,<br/>\nmiscarriages and/or ovarian infertility (due to not ovulating),  obesity -<br/>\nsugar cravings and excessive appetite,  difficulty losing weight;  mood<br/>\nswings.  This syndrome can lead to type II diabetes, cardiovascular<br/>\nproblems, obesity.<br/>\n    The body is not managing hormone levels well.  The increased<br/>\ntestosterone caauses the increase in facial hair.
